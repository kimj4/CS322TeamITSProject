Hola Jeb:
 
There is so much to do, and to learn.  I just came back from an OSEP focus group meeting on Transition and Post School outcome in DC.  There is so much to do, and so much to learn.  Unless we do something to improve results, the long term future doesn't look too good.  
 
I do not think that you know my older sister Diana. We are three, my brother Mario who teaches at FIU, my sister Diana (Soco), who lives in Cleveland, Ohio, and I.  I am very proud of both of them.  I want to share with you some e-mails that she forwarded to me about some awards that they are recommending her for the work that she does in Cleveland.  Her resume is attached FYI also. She is now facing the possibility that her husband of 40 years may have Alzheimer and Parkinson.  They are going throughout difficult times.  I wish that they could be in Florida.
 
Let me know when can we talk about CAFE.  What I keep saying to myself is that I need to keep the perspective clear and focused on those that need it the most.  It's not about me, nor any one individual, is about people with disabilities.  An adversarial position will not help anybody.  I continue to pray for understanding.

Dear Diana,
 
We would like to feature you as a very successful alum in the next issue of "The Netmaker" a publication of the Sisters of Notre Dame that has a circulation of 50,000.   Would you be willing to share your resume with me and be interviewed and photographed for this feature?  The articles for this issue are due March 10, so we would have to work on it during the next few weeks.  Let me know your thoughts.
