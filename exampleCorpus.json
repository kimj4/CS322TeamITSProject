        "body": "\n\nI am very concerned about a situation that I think is out of control.   Jay Leonard is a young man who is paralyzed from the waist down.He has two small children and he supports his family.  He is not on welfare.  He went to  school and learned to use the cad program and he does drafting.   He has worked with several architects but since it is so hard for him to get around, he works in his own space rather than their office.  He puts on paper what people tell him to.  I have watched him first hand and I know this is what he does.  He does not do the design, he doesn't do the engineering, he simply does the drafting and then it is checked by the architect and if it needs it, the architect seals it.   Now it seems an architect in Crawfordville has decided to charge Jay Leonard with practicing as an architect.  He filed a charge in DBPR and the case  number is 2001-09523.  Jay Leonard barely makes it in life, but he does survive.  I think this insensitive attack on him from an irate architect is  so unfair.  Is there anything that can be done to help this young man.  He hasn't even answered the charges yet and I am so concerned for his welfare and the welfare of his wife and children.  If you have someone who can help, Jay Leonard's phone number is  850 926 2821 .  Can you let me know if you can help.  Thank you so much.  I am sorry to miss your inauguration.  I missed the last one too.  Glad you had a nice family ship trip.   God Bless   Maggie Rogers 407 599 0260 \n\n"

I am glad to know that you are using your office on\ncampus more frequently, and I want to remind you that the kitchen in the\n\npresidential home is always open if you are in the mood for a good\nlunch--or snack--a few steps away.\n\nThe last time we spoke you asked about the CEPRI Equity Study.  Since\nthat time, the study has been published.  Based on the data that they\ncollected, CEPRI calculated a \"funding per FTE (full-time equivalent)\nstudent\" figure for each of the state public universities which\ngenerally validates our own findings.  These are the CEPRI per FTE data:\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Florida:--------------------$15,858\nUniversity of South Florida:--------------$13,436\nFlorida State University:-----------------$11,409\nFlorida International University:----------$10,207\n\nGroup Average:-------------------------$12,728\n\n\nThese are the four public institutions in our system which are\nclassified as Carnegie Research Extensive (or Research I.)  The average\nfor this group, again, using the CEPRI numbers is $12,728 per FTE\nstudent.  FIU comes out $2,521 below the average of the group for each\nof the 21,800 FTE equivalent students that we serve, or a total of $52\nmillion per year BELOW the average of our sister RI institutions.  The\nCEPRI data confirm our point that --compared to our peers--FIU is\ngrossly under-funded.  By the way UCF, a virtual RI, fares even worse.\nAlso, CEPRI uses 1999-2000 data.  The current numbers make the disparity\n\neven greater.\n\nI want to be very careful not to mislead you in any way regarding this\nfinding.  The conclusion that I have drawn here is not what the CEPRI\nstudy concluded, even though I am using their precise figures to prove\nmy point.  As the saying goes, \"Figures lie and liars figure.\"  No one\nis lying about the funding per FTE student, but what CEPRI did was to\ngroup the institutions, not by their Carnegie research classifications\nas I have done, but rather, by their SREB (Southern Regional Education\nBoard) classifications (sounds like an NCAA conference!)  In doing that,\n\nCEPRI did not compare FIU to our true Carnegie peers.  I believe that\nusing a regional association classification over the national Carnegie\nFoundation is inappropriate.\n\nThanks for your continued support.  I look forward to having the\nopportunity to discuss these points with you in person.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nMitch Maidique\n\n\n\n"

But DCF said they want to terminate the mother's rights.....Governor Bush, she already surrendered her rights to the Baby on November 25th.  The Judge asked her attorney if she was in sound state of mind, she agreed.....\n\nDCF had an attorney (since then has resigned form the department) who demanded on DCF terminating the Mothers rights and they would place the baby with us.....Egos...................\n\nWe have the next trial date this Monday January 6th, Judge Moses Baker is the presiding Judge.....DCF NEEDS TO BACK OFF.   Everyone agrees (even the Judge) that their is NO reason why we cannot have this a private adoption.\n\nHere's the best part.  At the TPR trial for the Father on September 5th, 2002, the Judge said he would sign off.  Then, per your help, I received a letter from David May indicating that the Judge has the TPR papers in the works....Governor Bush, he NEVER SIGNED THE ORDER AND NOW, MISPLACE THE PAPERS.\n\nWe had our attorney Fed Ex the paperwork to the Father in Prison,he has signed the papers and sent them back to our attorney...he will be on the telephone in prison on Monday, to swear that he signed the papers and that he does NOT want the baby....This is ridiculous....I will bill DCF for the money that I have now spent on the attorney to do this.\n\nGovernor Bush, NOW I DESPERATELY NEED YOUR HELP.....STOP DCF. The  Judge keeps overruling DCF's request, but what if he does not on Monday.\n\nHere is the last part. After we took the MAPP training class,we started the process to have a home study done...(June) IT IS STILL NOT DONE....It is sitting on the supervisors desk for three weeks.....We NEED IT ON MONDAY to show the Judge we are approved and ready to go!   Children's Home Society is so slow and unorganized.  They need help.................\n\nPlease get DCF off of our and everyone's back....Isn't the fact that the baby is in the perfect home,and DCF and everyone is thrilled about it, enough? they did their jobs..Don't they have enough kids in the system now?

One Miami man convicted of child endangerment in New York for allegedly raping a child pleaded guilty later to raping a foster child in his care in Florida, according to an investigation by The Miami Herald. \n\nAnother foster parent pleaded guilty to armed robbery for breaking into a man's apartment and holding him at gunpoint with her boyfriend in 1988. And a Jacksonville man who served 15 years in prison for heroin trafficking became a foster parent along with his wife in July. \n\n\n\nFelons Say Agency Aware Of Records \n\nFoster parents contacted by the newspaper said the Department of Children and Families knew about their past convictions but allowed them to care for foster children because they had paid for their crimes and reformed their behavior. \n\n``They know everything about me,'' said Leon Campbell, who was released from prison in 1991 after serving time for heroin trafficking. He now helps run his local church and is involved with a prison drug- rehabilitation program. \n\n``I showed them how my life has changed. Everything was done properly.'' \n\nState law disqualifies people who have been convicted of certain crimes from becoming foster parents, but not all felonies are included on the list of disqualifying offenses. \n\nNot included are welfare fraud, forgery and grand theft. \n\nThe state also has discretion to consider how a person has reformed himself or herself in cases in which the applicant's criminal record is more than three years old. \n\nIf the person is disqualified, he or she can appeal the decision. \n\nThe Herald reported that the state placed foster children in the homes of 168 convicted felons in the last five years and received payments of $10 to $50 a day per child. \n\nThere are about 5,000 foster homes in the state. \n\n\n\nInternal Investigation Under Way \n\nBut DCF officials dispute the number of convicted felons serving as foster parents. \n\n``Our findings lead us to believe that there are some inaccuracies in the article,'' agency spokesman Bob Brooks said. \n\n``I don't believe the picture is as bad as it's made out to be.'' \n\nBrooks said he will know how many felons are foster parents next week, when the agency's internal investigation is complete. \n\nSome of the cases revealed by the Herald include: \n\n* Carlos Estrella, convicted of child endangerment for allegedly raping a child in New York in 1966. He became a Florida foster parent in 1995 and received payments from DCF until three days before his 1999 arrest for raping a child in his care. Estrella has since died. DCF is being sued in this case. \n\n* Mary Helen Walley, 52, was sentenced to two years in prison for selling crack cocaine to a Tampa police officer in 1990. She has six foster children. \n\n``If they didn't think I have what it takes to take care of these children, they wouldn't have given them to me,'' Walley said. \n\n* Ann Ruth Hodges, 33, was sentenced to three years' probation for a home-invasion robbery nearly 15 years ago. \n\nShe pleaded guilty to armed robbery, armed burglary, false imprisonment and possession of a firearm during a felony. \n\nThe Homestead woman has five foster children. \n\n``I don't have anything to hide,'' she said. ``I have those crimes in my background, and I'd rather not talk about it.''\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I have wanted to do this\n\nfor several years, but it has proved to be impossible. When it takes every penny you earn to survive, you just cannot save money. \n\nWhen taxes eat up every spare dime you could have used for the support of your family, and you hear some stupid politician say \n\nsomething about raising taxes, you just want to scream in his ear! \n\n \n\nAs far as credit cards go, people  like myself do not qualify for credit cards...key word is CREDIT, for which you do not have \n\nwhen your broke. Even those who qualify with some credit card institution that do not have the means to repay easily find \n\nthemselves destroyed by bad credit.\n\n \n\nGet a new job? Many of us have had to already because of companies going belly up or cutting back, some people \n\nhaven't been so lucky to find another job, or they have had to accept lower paying jobs just to cover the bare necessities. \n\nI personally haven't had a raise now for 3 years, I have had major increases in health care payments, and I have seen \n\nmy company bonus plan dwindle to a $12.00 Christmas bonus because of the slow down in the economy. \n\n \n\nBuild an estate plan? Save more? Eat out less? Smell the roses?\n\nWell of these, my wife and I get 1 meal out a year on our wedding anniversary...\n\nWhich we just observed our 22nd on December 27th at the local Cracker Barrel Restaurant\n\n(the bill came to almost $20.00, and I left a $2.00 tip to the waitress) \n\nbecause we just cannot afford these luxuries, much less be able to smell the roses! \n\n \n\nI watched my wife cry at Christmas with her mother because we had no money for Christmas gifts. \n\nThat is very painful to the inner soul. But we all have our love for each other, and the\n\nLove for God and country. My wife does has a prospect for new employment, for which she\n\nWill know the answer to in the next couple of weeks, and hopefully she will be hired. \n\nIt is a $6.50 an hour job, and it will greatly help our current condition. She was laid off \n\nIn October 2002 because of the mismanagement at the school where she worked. \n\n \n\nBy the way, I have lost about 5 lbs of body weight this past year. I am of small body-size already, \n\nand I don't have any body fat to lose so the \"exercise more\" statement really is not something I need \n\nto do any way...in fact I have to conserve energy because I have not been able to afford to eat right lately.\n\n \n\nI do have an appointment on Thursday morning with someone at our bank to help figure out our financial position. \n\nAt this point, we are looking at falling back and punting as an option but not a desired direction...but more \n\nconcessions will have to be made at this families home before a way out of debt will come.\n\n \n\nGod has provided for my family for 22 years now because of hard work, faith, and \n\nthe sacrifices we have made as a family. I have nothing to be ashamed of about \n\nthe way we live. I am a hard and honest worker, and so is my wife. \n\n \n\nTake care Governor Bush. \n\nThink of families like mine, and pass the word around\n\nabout families like ours when ever you get a chance!\n\n \n\nBryan Siddell \n\n**********************************************************************************************************\n\nCNN Money's  \n\n10 most profitable resolutions:\n\nhttp://money.cnn.com/2002/12/06/pf/saving/holiday_resolutions/index.htm\n\nMax out your 401(k) and IRA\n\nPay off your credit card debt\n\nGet a (new) job\n\nBuild an estate plan\n\nSave more\n\nQuit smoking\n\nLose weight/exercise more\n\nEat out less\n\nGet organized\n\nSmell the roses\n\n"

Oh yeah! Eggelletion did vote for building\nmore jails, for who? and he voted to protect us from God by not voting for\nprayer in school as a State Rep.) of Black communities that were forced (By\nCounty Staff, Handpick Negro's from the Communities and at least one County\nCommissioner, who only claim to fame is this bill for Blacks) into having\nthe so-called Neighborhood Enhancement Districts protection against abuses,\nencroachments, taxation w/o representation, conflict of interest, Just and\nEquitable Taxation, Proper Use of Public Property (Gentrification) and Full\nDisclosure of Public Records and Proceedings.\n\nIt concerns me that the County Administrator, and the County Attorney would\nallow County Staff to present a program of this magnitude, to the County\nCommissioners for their endorsement and approval, with out checks and\nbalances or having accountability (Oh yeah! Its for the Black Community,\nNBA, it does not matter.).\n\nThe fact that County Staff seem to have been relentless in their efforts to\nextend time and time again, to vested interest groups and at least one\nCounty Commissioner, to impose this program on Black Communities raises some\nserious concerns of conflict of interest and many questions.\n\nHow many County Commissioners have no choice but, to support these programs,\nbecause they may be directly or indirectly a part of Political Corruption,\nConflict of Interest, Improper Use of Public Property, Providing Inside\nCounty Information to various Individuals, Groups, friends and or relatives.\nIn some cases ensuring contracts that if, they did not do as the County\nCommissioner(s) said do, that the Contractor can rest assure that they would\nnot receive any work in their District (The people District)? What\nHomeowners Presidents and officers have received monies as a result of being\nthe Homeowners Association President or the Neighborhood Enhancement\nDistrict, Presidents and officers received pay, favor and or other royalties\nas a result of their status? What Contractors would come forward and reveal\nthe Commissioner(s) involved in this type od corruption? Will some of the\nDemocratic County Commissioners use their political connection with the\nRepublican Governor, to cover some of this magnitude up? Your guest is as\ngood as any. I am sure this e-mail will call for County Cover-up time.\n\nOne can believe that County government can benefit from programs such as the\nNeighborhood Enhancement, District by pushing aggressive code and zoning, to\njustify gentrification, and later blaming untrained, unqualfield, uneducated\nand unpolitical aware folk for the abuse and unlawful acts. Where will\nCommissioner Eggelletion be when this happens? Why would the Commissioner\nallow the program to be in place without safe guards? Oh yeah! He is a\n\"Consultant\".\n\nWord to the wise, to County Employees and citizens. The County Whistle\nBlower Program, is a lot worst than the County Equal Opportunity Office.\n\nThe County Administrator was commended for his efforts in the Constitutional\nOffice of the Supervisor of Election attack. Well as the sound goes, Who was\nmaking Love, to your Old Lady, While you was out making love. In other words\nCounty Staff has its own problems and we do not see anyone calling in the\nGovernor. Will the County Commission allow or call for an Federal audit on\nthe County's Administrative practice with in County Government? I dare them.\n\nThis is why our communities need policy to protect us, because the County is\nthe only local government we have and we no longer trust you guys. Sure you\ncan find some idiot to challenge our concern, but I assure you that person\nis not informed or has a vested interest.\n\nN.A.A.C.P. You are not doing anything. don't get caught covering up for the\nCounty as it has already been suggested. Bill, do you remember the last two\narticle that the County Administrator implicated you as. To you and your\nStaff, if you cannot be apart of the solution, I suggest you not be a part\nof the problem. I did not know, I am new at this, and I am sorry (It may be\ntrue) but, it does not handle well in the Black Community. This is a New\nYear, anything goes.\n----- Original Message -----\n"

Based on my reading, subsection163.524 of\nthe Florida Statutes does not provide a process for removal.  However,\nthere may be general procedures in the statutes which apply, of which I\nam unaware.\n\nI will request the County Attorney to provide a response to your\nquestion regarding removal of a member from a neighborhood council.  I\nwill forward the response to you as soon as possible.\n\nCynthia Chambers\n\n\n>>> \"Joe Major\" <j_major@bellsouth.net> 12/30/02 04:08PM >>>\nHi Ms Chambers:\n\nHappy Holidays to you and yours.\n\nMs. Chambers, I do not believe Ms. Tillman-Watson have you guys\nattention. It is my understanding that the Washington Park Community\nhave three forces to work with: 1.) The Washington Park Homeowners\nAssociation, the 2.)Lafayette Hart Park Association and 3.) the\nNeighborhood Preservation and Enhancement Plan (The N.P.E.P.). The\nCounty assured Ms. Tillman- Watson equal inclusion of all governmental\nprocess, as the county do for the other two entities of the Washington\nPark Community. I do not think that She is looking for special\ntreatment, but equal treatment.\n\nThe County have empowered the Washington Park Homeowners Association to\noperate as two entices which may be a conflict of interest. However, the\nNeighborhood Preservation and Enhancement Plan is County Government\ndriven and should comply with the same laws, rules, regulation and\nprocedures that the County is accountable to up-hold.\n\nThe N.P.E.P. is responsible for providing their resident with\ninformation in a reasonable time (Generally, Ten Working days), Full\ndisclosure of Public Records and Proceedings, fair and equal\ndistribution of all government funding, and inclusion in the decision\nmaking process of the Community.\n\nThe County should no longer cover up for those folk that are not\ncomplying with the law or sound governmental practices.We can not be\nresponsible for folk incompetence, yet, wanting to be in charge of\nsomething.\n\n The Coalition is requesting that the County provide residents with\nlaws, policy and other tools to remove folk from the various positions\nof the Neighborhood Preservation and Enhancement Program that violate\nvoters, citizens,and taxpayer Rights. Otherwise, you guys can be\nmisconstrued as showing favor or causing serious problems in the Black\nCommunity, purposely or otherwise.\n\nPlease provide the Coalition with policy or procedures that govern these\nprograms and the tools that the residents have available to them, which\nwill remove folk from these positions for not complying with their\nobligations.\n\nThank you.\n\n----- Original Message -----\n"

No parece que ustedes quieren que los presos tengan ninguna esperanza en poder salir antes de tiempo....Comprendo esto para presos VIOLENTOS O ASESINOS, pero me parece injusto que para una persona no violenta esta ley se aplique.  De todas formas yo guardar\u00e9 todo el archivo que prepar\u00e9 y lo volver\u00e9 a enviar en julio/2003.\n \nMuchas gracias por su atenci\u00f3n y nuevamente muchas felicidades .\n \nGo Hurricanes!\n \nEstrella R. Pereira\nOrlando\n \n"

        "body": "\n                                                                                                                                                               January 3, 2003\n\n\nDear Governor Bush:\n\n     I have written to your family in the past, expressing my views on what a proud time in my life it was to serve under your Father during the Gulf War, I have written to your Brother sending him and his administration praise on what a tremendous job he is doing as President, and I have written you, Governor Bush, trying to put into words just how overjoyed I am with the job that you are doing as my state's Governor... Apparently, I'm not the only Floridian that's happy with your work, as the last election will reflect.\n\n     This time, I'm writing on behalf of my brother-in-law. He is a Colombian National that has worked hard in this country for many years. \n\n     In April 1995 my wife ( A Naturalized U.S. Citizen, and a proud Republican) and I (also a proud member of the Republican Party) petitioned for him to be granted permanent Residency, a green card.\n\n     All has been going well, as he was issued an Employment Authorization Document, and has worked hard ever since, but the problem is that the process in dealing with the INS is a long and difficult one. There are situations that occur that are hindered by his lack of a Green Card, For example... His son is incredibly intelligent, and at the age of 16 has been accepted to Rutgers University, an honor and opportunity that my never come again. However, admittance into the college requires showing documentation of Legal Residency.\n\n     I am well aware of the terrorist threats that we now deal with on a daily basis, I am also fully cognizant of the fact that any alien could constitute a possible threat to our citizens and our way of life. For these reasons the INS is being extra cautious of allowing aliens to permanently reside in the U.S. But, let me assure you, Sir, that my Brother-In Law is, without a doubt, the most honest, hardworking taxpayer that I have ever had the pleasure to know. He loves this nation, and will always be true to it's cause. He wants only to have the ability to make a better life for his family by earning his green card and eventually becoming a U.S. Citizen. These are dreams he has had for a long, long time.\n\n     I consider myself to be an honorable person. I have served for 14 years in the U.S. Army Signal Corps, I have been awarded many high honors by the Department of the Army, I am currently a Deputy Sheriff with the Broward Sheriff's Office and I think of myself as a good judge of character ... with these things in mind, I can tell you straight out that I will do anything necessary to sponsor him or give him the highest recommendation possible to complete this petition for residency. He will make a fine citizen and a great American, if given the chance. \n\n     Mr. Governor, may I respectfully request that your office look into the status of his petition for Residency.

        "body": "\n\nJanuary 2, 2003\n\n \n\n \n\nDear Jeb:\n\n \n\nI'm writing for several reasons. As you probably have heard there has been untrue and unnecessary media coverage of recent events involving the Hillsborough County Republican Executive Committee elections. I have attached the articles, as well as my emails to their author, Laura Kinsler. In my opinion, the instigator of these articles, Al Higginbotham, Jr., is an embarrassment to the party. He has distorted the truth for his own gain and is attempting to create a deep rift between Republicans in Hillsborough County. He repeatedly uses his role in your re-election campaign to legitimize his activities. As someone who has personally had private comments repeated and taken out of context in the press, I'm sure you can appreciate how detrimental Mr. Higginbotham's behavior is to our party.\n\n \n\nIt might be helpful for someone from your office to have a chat with Mr. Higginbotham and his cohort Eric Brown. If they are truly loyal Republicans, they need to understand that internal party differences should be handled within the party, not in the media. The \"Field Hand\" comment, which was featured in one of the attached articles, is now the topic for next week's \"Speak Up\" column in the Tribune Metro section. Enough is enough.\n\n \n\nToday's Tampa Tribune also contains an article identifying possible successors to Pam Iorio, Supervisor of Elections, should she choose to run for mayor. Mr. Higginbotham has expressed interest in this appointment. I do not believe that someone who puts his own interests above the good of the party deserves to be rewarded. Please do not consider him for this highly visible, important role.\n\n \n\nI believe this appointment should go to a loyal, hard-working party member. I think Janet Kovach would make an excellent Supervisor of Elections and I am asking you to give her serious consideration for the post. I know she has served under your leadership in the past and I believe she is someone you can trust to handle the significant responsibilities of this position. \n\n \n\nThank you in advance for your consideration. I wish you the best of luck as you embark on your historic second term and in any future endeavors. I am proud to have campaigned for you and will be happy to assist you in any way I can during the next four years.\n\n \n\nRegards,\n\n \n\nAngela\n\n \n\n Angela S. Brock\n1000 W.

        "body": "\n\nDear Governor,\n \n    I know that you do not have a lot of time to read lengthy emails, however, I thought this might interest you. As the Executive Director of the Ruskin Chamber I am given a column in the local newspaper. Over the past two weeks and for next week I have been writing a column on divorce and the family. I am calling the series \"Renew the Family Tree in 2003\".\n \nI have included these three columns below I hope you have the opportunity to read them and if you would like, you could use the tagline of \"Renew the Family Tree in 2003\"\n \nSincerely,\n\n\nDanny Kushmer\nwww.ruskinchamber.org\n \n  _____  \n\n\nChamber Notes, The Ruskin Chamber of Commerce\nBy: Daniel Kushmer\n \nDecember 26, 2002, Column\n \nThe Office of Vital Statistics reports in 2001 there were 153,298 marriages with 85,259 divorces. Specifically, in Hillsborough County 9,581 marriages took place with 5,472 divorces. The dissolution of marriage rate increased in 2001 to 5.2 per 1,000 population. And, the marriage rate has steadily decreased since 1997 from 10.6 per 1,000 in 1997 to 9.3 per 1,000 in 2001.\n\n \n\nOver the next few columns, I would like to take the opportunity to discuss ways we can bring the family back together. Divorce and the breakdown of the family unit is a strain on the economy in so many ways. And, as a chamber we must look at all aspects that affect the business climate. We all know that divorce usually causes an economic hardship, usually affecting children as well. The lose of homes, jobs and standard of living is all too common.\n\n \n\nAgain, back to the Office of Vital Statistics. Out of the 85,259 divorces in 2001 at least 34,483 of these divorces affected children. In today's world, businesses compete for an ever stretching dollar and when the family is pulled apart so to the dollars. Today's mobile society has lost sight of the family unit and the role the extended family plays. Grandma, Grandpa, brother's & sister's, and aunt's & uncle's are vital to a healthy family. When that is removed by relocation the core family must work harder to stay healthy and united. So many factors play a role in the divorce rate and reduction in marriage. I will not say I know all of them, however, in the new millenium society seems to discourage the sanctity of marriage.\n\n \n\nMovies, television, radio, print media, and advertising have all contributed. Watch your favorite show, read your favorite magazine, or listen to your favorite radio program and in just a few short minutes you will be able to see the glorification of being single and living a selfish life. How many single parents do you know? How many of these moms and dads do not have support from the other parent? This is truly the tragedy. We bring children into this world and then expect them to grow up and be good citizens, yet we are not equipping them to achieve this expectation.\n\n \n\nA group of Clergy in Jacksonville, Florida has said \"What God has joined together, let the Church help hold together\". This is relevant since more than 75% of all marriages are performed by clergy. Government involvement in marriage is not the answer; however, making it a little more difficult to get a divorce without making it more lucrative for attorneys can't hurt. \n\n \n\nFamilies need help and next week I will discuss further how I think we can work together to bring the family back together. Please stay tuned and if you have any comments, please do not hesitate to write me at  <mailto:ruskinchamber@earthlink.net> ruskinchamber@earthlink.net.\n\n \nJanuary 2, 2003 Column\n \n\nHappy New Year! I hope all the citizens of SouthShore had a wonderful Christmas. Last week I began a series addressing the tragedy of divorce and the breakdown of the family unit. I alluded to the church and the fact that the clergy perform over 75% of all marriages. This week I would like to elaborate on this fact. \"What God has joined together, let the Church help hold together\", but first.\n\n \n\nTo further illustrate how divorce affects children, lets look at a few statistics. Children whose parents are divorced have higher rates of delinquency and substance abuse. Children raised in an environment of conflict also appear to be at risk for defiance, academic failure, immaturity, disrespect, peer conflicts, and poor self-control. In understanding the unique role a mother and father play in raising children, parents can develop a deeper, more meaningful, parent/child relationship. Husbands and wives who develop effective communication patterns will be better equipped to deal with conflict and the challenges of raising children.\n\n \n\nUnderstanding the economic hardship a divorce places on a family and the potential long-term consequences placed on children you can see why is important the business community should be concerned. Companies throughout the country need consumers. They also need a steady source of educated employees. Divorce can and usually does disrupt both of these needs for business to prosper.\n\n \n\nSince most Americans need to be prepared to up-root and relocate the family to follow employment, the extended family is less involved. This part of our families' relationship is vital for a healthy marriage, so, how do we bring this back to the family? I believe the church can and should play a major role. The church family can be a healthy alternative to the extended family, especially when none exist. The leaders and lay leaders of the church can bring families together with other families that share commonalties.\n\n \n\nBefore taking any legal steps to end a marriage, couples should make sure that they have tried all possible ways to save it. Many communities and social and religious organizations offer counseling services either free or on a sliding scale. The church has vast resources and programs that are designed to help families stay together. Also, the church membership is a diverse network of individuals knowledgeable in many areas. From programs designed to provide education for new marriages to support and assistance to single parents and many aspects in between the church can be your one stop source.\n\n \n\nIt's a new-year with many possibilities, hopes, and dreams. Let's make this year, the year we \"Renew the Family Tree in 2003\". More on \"Renew\" next week. As always, your comments are welcomed and you can reach me at  <mailto:ruskinchamber@earthlink.net> ruskinchamber@earthlink.net.\n\n \n\nJanuary 9, 2003 Column\n\n \nWhen you make a serious commitment to another person, you open up the possibility of happiness for yourself. However, if your not getting the love you want from the person you're with, you need to do something about it. You need to communicate with greater accuracy and sensitivity, understanding how to let go of the self-defeating behaviors, and focus your energy on meeting your partner's needs. If an open and honest line of communication is established the downward spiral of the power struggle is transformed into a mutually beneficial process of spiritual and emotional growth.\n\n \n\nUnderstanding the differences between men and women is the first step. We are different and as such, we have different needs and wants. Many times this is the only reason given for divorce, \"we just don't see eye to eye, were too different\". Well yea! You are different and you need to know this from the start. As written in previous columns, divorce is usually an economic and social disaster affecting more than just the husband and wife. Children become pawns in the process. As a society, we need to help reduce the divorce rate and bring back economic stability to the family, the life-blood of this country.\n\n \n\n\"Renew the Family Tree in 2003\". The American Heritage Dictionary describes Family Tree as a Noun and, 1.A genealogical diagram of a family's ancestry. 2.The ancestors and descendants of a family considered as a group. A family is a group, a group of individuals all with different ideas, desires, needs and wants. And, if understanding this and capitalizing on the differences a family can become very successful.\n\n \n\nThroughout the years we have heard of various ways to bring the family together. Family night, Family game night, Dinner's together, and many other activities all have a purpose. Bringing us together. We do live in a very mobile society and with an ever-increasing tax burden; many of us work twice as hard as we did not too many years ago, just to pay taxes. What are your priorities? Just bringing home the bacon or, bringing home the bacon and helping the family fry it up. Quality time does always have to mean quantity; however, quality time does require your time.\n\n \n\nI would like to add one more to the various ways you can bring your family together. The Family Tree. What better way to understand your family heritage and help you and your children understand why you think as you do. You can trace your family tree in many ways, the library is a great reference and of course, the Internet can give you real-time history. One website in particular is a great resource. Ancestory.com is good place to start to \"Renew your Family Tree in 2003\". Of course, this is just an exercise that can give you a lot of enjoyment. The real purpose is to bring your family together.\n\n \n\nIf you have a church home, go see the lay leader or pastor and find out what kind of resources are available that can help you and your family, stay together. I believe the church has a moral obligation to society to help the American Family and does just that. If you do not have a church home, find one. The communities in SouthShore are blessed with many churches for all walks of life and faith, use these resources. It is my desire to see the American Family stay together and prosper, not only is it good for business, it's good for America.

Maria's DCF social worker, Olive Walker,  had requested that Maria's visitations  and her parents were to be eliminated because \"they were rough with the baby\"  and \"the baby shows fear with them\".  That is not true, as evidenced by the two reports  that DCF made stating that \"mother is appropriate\" and \"baby shows  no fear\".   Robert Boyack, who is Olive's superior, said to Maria that she is not being heard, and said he is going to look into the case.  I'm sure that's your\ndoing, and we thank you for that.\n \nJust now,  Maria's attorney said that in the motion that Olive filed, they are going to file for child support and supposedly told them she wasn't working.  That is another lie being perpetrated by Olive because she has repeatedly called Maria here at work.\n \nThis whole matter smacks of a combination of incompetence and favoritism towards the father, a known domestic violence abuser.    There is a really serious problem here .  \n \nMaria's attorney, a public defender, says this is all being done to try to terminate Maria's parental rights.  The baby's father,\nJoel Balmaceda, has always said to Maria that \"he will do anything to take the baby away\" since Maria separated from him after he beat her up.    I think Joel has influenced Olive to the point where she is either afraid or incapable of making an\nindependent decision.\n \nWhat now?\n \nElaine Adler\n"

It has been great.\n\nMy other current claim to fame is as a Delray Commissioner I sit (with the Boynton\nBeach City Commission) on our shared Sewage Treatement Plant board.  In fact\nmy Mom is so proud as I was elected Chairman of that Board.  Ugh!\n\nAnyway, our Treatment plant is embarking on a project to convert our facility to 100%\nreuse quality capacity.  This will allow for us to replace existing potable water \nirrigation demands on the aquifer with our reclaimed supply.  Currently we provide\naround 20% of our discharge as reuse quality which is delivered to several of the golf course\ncommunities for their irrigation needs, thus reducing the draw on groundwater supplies.\n\nIn order to accomplish this we are applying for $6mm in Federal Grant Funding.  I \nwould very much appreciate if you would consider writing a letter\nof support to accompany our Grant Application.  I have attached a copy of a sample\nletter which provides additional information to you on the project.\n\nThanks in advance for your consideration.  Lori joins me in wishing you and\nyour family a great 2003!

I really \nappreciate all that you tried to do for me regarding the beach restoration \nsituation in Brevard County involving the Villager Condominiums in \nIndialantic.\n\nNow we are in a new crisis.  My husband and I own 2 pizza restaurants called \nBrooklyn Pizza.  My husband has been in business for himself  since 1984.  He \nis a real Mom and Pop type of operation.  Since he uses real quality food we \ndo not make the profits that the chains do.\n\nOur dilemma is this.  We are having trouble getting workman's comp insurance. \n All of the sudden they are refusing to insure us.  It feels like extortion \ntaking our premiums and once their is a claim you lose your right to get it.  \nMy husband has had a clean record and only until this year did he have an \nemployee hurt in a car accident in which he was not at fault.  We do not hire \nteenagers.  Our drivers must have PIP insurance to work with us and cannot \nwork for us if they get a speeding ticket.  Most of our drivers are in their \n30's.  They have good driving records and we do weekly checks on them through \nthe DMV.  \n\nIf we cannot find a company that will sell us the insurance at a reasonable \nrate we are out of business.  We opened our second Brooklyn Pizza just a year \nago.  One's in Orlando and the other in Winter Park.  We are told that we \nwill have to go through the state which will cost us about $50,000 a year.  \nOur overhead is so high this will put us out of business along with about 20 \nemployees then will have to go on unemployment.  We have until Jan. 12th to \nfind cheaper insurance and no one has been able to help us so far.\n\nI pray that you have some good news or advice for us.  Business has been down \nsince 911 and we are hanging on as we have kids that want to go to college.  \nPlease feel free to call my husband directly or myself.  Again thank you for \nall you've done for our state.  Have a blessed New Year and Noelle is in our \nprayers.\n\nSincerely,\nAndrea Gagliano\nabelcomm@aol.com\n407-740-7727,  fax 407-539-2180,  husbands cell # 321-276-5737- Carmelo \nGagliano\nPO BOX 146, Winter Park, FL 32790\n"

On April 15th, 2002 I suffered a medically induced heart attack because the BCBS approved Physician I went to the day before patted me on the head and said, \"Everybody suffers Indigestion sometimes.\" The next day, in total frustration, I went to my former doctor and in less then five minutes I was in the Critical Cardiac Unit. The approved BCBS Physician had administered about four times as much medication as needed. \n\nLast October I found out that my heart is fine now but to keep it that way I need a better wheelchair, namely one with automatic elevating leg-rests and reclining. After much searching and lots of measuring the permobil was selected to be the best. Two physicians and one physical therapist wrote up all the needed paperwork and we spent hours explaining the need to the medical review team. \n\nBCBS came back with the finding that they would pay for the base of the chair, the batteries, the armrests but not the seat or the leg-rests. The DME provider and I argued for hours that it makes no sense to approve 4 wheels and a motor without the seat. That's a bit like buying a car with no steering device. \n\nThinking that they may have mistaken the term \"base of the chair\" as \"basic chair\" we sent them a picture of their approved parts, to no avail.\n\nI am still a Medicaid Waiver Provider and working full-time but unless I am allowed to have a workable wheelchair that allows me to remain pain free I may not be able to continue.\n\nThis is only the latest debacle with BCBS. Can your office assist with this problem? \n\nI look forward to hearing from you again.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBirgit Wilhelm \n\n"

I am not aware (and it maybe as a result of my ignorance) what, if any, initiatives emanate from the Governor's Office or even the federal government directly to educate and motivate Americans to eat better and exercise more. It seems to me that not only could our government educate the public about this but that our leaders could use their pulpits to motivate and encourage by communicating with them directly (or even by example) , as opposed to a a government health bureaucracy sending bulletins to the medical profession. If  Americans were do take better care of themselves it not only would improve the quality of their lives but it also would reduce unnecessary medical expenses, such as Medicare and Medicaid costs, brought about due to avoidable health problems.\n \nI am passing this on to you as I know that you like public policy initiatives that directly help the people.

On\nApril 15th, 2002 I suffered a medically induced heart attack because the\nBCBS approved Physician I went to the day before patted me on the head and\nsaid, \"Everybody suffers Indigestion sometimes.\" The next day, in total\nfrustration, I went to my former doctor and in less then five minutes I was\nin the Critical Cardiac Unit. The approved BCBS Physician had administered\nabout four times as much medication as needed. \n\nLast October I found out that my heart is fine now but to keep it that way I\nneed a better wheelchair, namely one with automatic elevating leg-rests and\nreclining. After much searching and lots of measuring the permobil was\nselected to be the best. Two physicians and one physical therapist wrote up\nall the needed paperwork and we spent hours explaining the need to the\nmedical review team. \n\nBCBS came back with the finding that they would pay for the base of the\nchair, the batteries, the armrests but not the seat or the leg-rests. The\nDME provider and I argued for hours that it makes no sense to approve 4\nwheels and a motor without the seat. That's a bit like buying a car with no\nsteering device. \n\nThinking that they may have mistaken the term \"base of the chair\" as \"basic\nchair\" we sent them a picture of their approved parts, to no avail.\n\nI am still a Medicaid Waiver Provider and working full-time but unless I am\nallowed to have a workable wheelchair that allows me to remain pain free I\nmay not be able to continue.\n\nThis is only the latest debacle with BCBS. Can your office assist with this\nproblem? \n\nI look forward to hearing from you again.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBirgit Wilhelm \n"

I'm also tired of being nailed to the cross for $180. a month & then hear from foster parents they get so much more inc food stamps, clothing allowance $ for xmas & I was told they would get big money for Billy since he's high risk. Us grandparents keep them out of the foster care system & get no help at all.\nWe have gone thru all our savings just raising him & getting him treatments that aren't covered. All they say is so make him a foster child which I would never do!\nI know some of you have tried to help like Bob Graham but it seems like no use.

I am a former Republican Executive Committee Chairman for Pasco County and  Currently  the President of the West Pasco Republican Club.  I work very hard for Republicans.  I have met you briefly at political events and proudly display a photo with you and my daughter Rachel in my home.\n \nI know your time is incredibly valuable and that is why I have never written you in the past.  Nevertheless, I  feel obligated to write you today on behalf of  a good friend, a fellow Republican and an awesome Circuit Judge, Craig Villanti.  As you are aware, Judge Villanti is a candidate for the 2nd DCA Judicial vacancy.\n \nIn regard to political considerations, Judge Villanti is the only candidate for the 2nd DCA vacancy that is from Pasco County. In fact, a person from Pasco County has never sat on the 2nd DCA Court of Appeals.  Craig Villanti has always been a friend to the Republican Party and before becoming a Judge was active in the West Pasco Republican Club.\n \nFrom a Judicial perspective,  Judge Villanti  has a proven track record of being a strict constructionist and will not legislate from the bench.  He is brilliant and has a photographic memory. I have personally argued hundreds of cases in front of Judge Villanti including numerous Jury trials.  Regardless of the situation he  treats attorneys, clients and courtroom personnel  with respect, fairness and consistency.  In the criminal division, Judge Villanti follows the sentencing guidelines.  In trial,  his knowledge of the rules of evidence eliminates mistakes and appeals.\n \nAppointing Judge Craig Villanti to the 2nd DCA Court of Appeals is smart politically and great for the people of Florida.  A win win situation no matter how you analyze it.\n \nThank you for your time and consideration.  My entire family prays for your success.\n \n \nCordially,\n \nJeff Lucas    Jeff@ACLLAW.net           \n \n"

Without the benefit of living in Florida or doing the necessary research about Florida, the one thing that comes to mind is transportation.  A Trans-Florida High Speed Rail could be your \"Man-On-The-Moon\" idea.  The idea seems to be well advanced in the planning and is supported by business and economic leaders across the State.   Of course not everybody agrees with the route (I'll let somebody else present the Disney point of view,) but I remain optimistic that the Tampa to Orlando leg can be built at minimal public cost.  Such a high speed transportation system would make history in this country.  And it's needed.  I only wish we had it in California.\n   The escalating cost of workers\u2019 compensation and healthcare insurance are two very important issues, and I know you are already on top of those.  And my advice on the budget is the last thing you need.  Therefore I come back to transportation.\n   I will think more about your question on the plane going West.

        "body": "\n\nThanks for the email, Jeb. I am honored and I will take it to heart. Sorry I was away for the week and couldn't get to it until now.\n \nI believe in fundamental freedoms and completely free markets and am very much driven that way. So hear my suggestions with that bias.\n \nOff the cuff, there are a few things I am thinking about. They are all pretty radical, and since you are so close to being our next President, you might want to be careful about which ones, if any you might pursue.\n \nFundamentally in the US,\nOur school system doesn't work\nOur prison system is not ideal\nMedicine is poorly delivered.\n \nAll major state issues\n \nOn education, I would suggest breaking the union, or at least ending tenure. Since unilaterally doing this might be tough, you might want to work with all the other Governors who have good hearts and do something all at once. My suggestion would be to do it in May. Don't renegotiate with the unions. Spend the next three months recruiting teachers from the pool of active parents and scabs will cross over. Put all the principals in charge to hire and fire during the Summer so they can build their team for the new year. No safety net for teachers. And I would raise their average pay slightly, but leave it up to the Principal to determine individual salaries.\n \nOn prisons, I have an even more radical thought. Privitize all the prisons and allow them to \"bid\" for prisoners. Let's say we are both prison wardens. I bid $200k to put some killer away for 15 years, and you bid $185k. You get him. He is now your responsibility. If he escapes or dies of unnatural causes, you owe the state $1 million. If he does anything again, you have to put him up. But if, when released, he becomes a good citizen, you get 25% of any taxes he pays to the state. As a warden, you are now motivated to keep him inexpensively, make sure he never breaks the law again and train him for a career while he is there.\n \nIn medicine, it is very complicated and it gets to the issue of \"what is a life worth?\" And, are some lives worth more than others?\nI think the states should probably have a safety net here where some level of health care is given out as though the taxpayer is actually paying the insurance for all the people of the state, but rather than having rules on what the docs can and can't do, the market should do its magic. Individuals who want further coverage beyond the basics will have to buy their own coverage. \n \n \n \nI don't know how you get to any of these solutions politically, except if they are clearly the right way to go, and you just have to overcome unions to get there, work with the other Governors. \n \nOne other thing. On tort reform, once you have put a price on a life, I think it would be easy to determine the maximum award of damages in a personal injury case.\n \nI am game to talk about these issues in further detail any time. I just read The Tipping Point, and there is something in there about crime and how it comes about that might be worth your time.\n \n \nAll the best,\nTim\n \n \n\n  _____  \n\nThis mailbox protected from junk email by Matador\nfrom MailFrontier, Inc. http://info.mailfrontier.com <http://info.mailfrontier.com/> \n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\n"

Three weeks ago, we had a hearing and the Judge Baker overruled it and told DCF to keep their ego's out of his courtroom......Tim Beasley threawtened that he would fight this to the end! \n\n\nAt the trial on this Monday, we are praying and everyone is praying that DCF does not appeal and contest this order...If so, Dave this could stay in the system for 2 years.  We met with our attorney yesterday and she is said Tim Beasley is no longer with the department, but the new attorney for DCF seems more reasonable. DCF wants to terminate the mothers rights,but SHE HAS VOLUNTARILY DONE SO ON NOVEMBER 25TH. \n\n\nLastly, we had an independent homestudy completed and approved on our own.

        "body": "You never let up, do you!?  OK, here goes.\n \nRE: REVENUE SOURCES\n \n1.      Find a way to collect sales tax on internet and other purchased deliveries in Florida.  This is a huge loop hole and needs to be fixed.  Can  the federal government help in legislation this year to make it easier for shippers to collect and remit the tax?  Can you be the catalyst in the effort with the state's US senators and congressmen?  I don't know which legislative committee in Congress would be responsible for this but certainly Hastert, Fritz, and the White House --Nick Callio (?)  would get involved if they shared your sense of urgency.  \n \n2.      Failing that,   you should try to organize a cooperative effort  amongst the states to collect each others taxes and remit.   We already discussed this on a previous e-mail. \n \n3.      I have an unconfirmed but abiding suspicion that many people in Florida don't pay their intangible taxes on the theory that the state has been pretty inept in  enforcing  the collection.  This was long the attitude among many people I know.  Am not sure of the extent of that pervasive thought today.   I realize that your beefing up collection capability flies in the face of your desire to eliminate this tax, but if that doesn't happen this year I would dare say there is a lot of money being left on the table you should go after-and in good conscience. \n \n4.      Go after the unrighteous sales tax exemptions---no conservative will fault you for this.  \n \nCOST SAVINGS\n \n1.      I think it would be very useful to resurrect the opportunity to have a free diagnostic done on additional ways the state can save money through centralized purchasing.  I was very impressed with the presentation that Dave Wenner from McKinsey & Co. made  and his proposal was very compelling.  I believe that the only reason that Cynthia Henderson  turned him down was because of a very strong personal negative reaction to him and the way he made his proposal.  Wenner said that he was confident  that there were additional opportunities to save several hundreds of million dollars over and above what was contracted out beginning in the first six months of implementation!  It would cost the state nothing to find this out.   Why not find out?\n \n CLASS SIZE---EDUCATION\n \n1.      I think your best hope here is to implement the most draconian solutions to meeting the requirements of the amendment at the least cost---double sessions, more bussing, etc.-all in the effort to create a groundswell of public opinion to overturn this initiative at the first opportunity.  I know that classroom space and  capital cost  is only one element of the problem, and you would have to renegotiate current teachers' work schedules to enable these longer hours as well as hire new teachers.\n \n     2.   If it is true that Florida needs 160,000 new teachers over the next ten years and Florida only \n            turns out about 5600 certified teachers per year-with only 60% going into the public school   \n            system, it is obvious we will never come close to filling the need with the same old methods .\n            Besides confirming that Florida is competitive in salaries,  continuing to work to place the best    \n            principals in the schools,  in my opinion there has to be a revolutionary shift in thought and \n            practice on how we get teachers.  We not only need to expand the alternative certification \n            programs to more quickly bring  associate (intern) teachers into the system but we should\n            work to change the criteria for certification-to allow perfectly competent and intelligent and\n            successful people who don't necessarily have an education degree  to get certified to teach!\n            This is already being done in the community college system and they are great teachers. If we \n             don't do something like this we will never meet the goal. \n \n            One of Florida's greatest untapped human resources is its large percentage of young retirees.  \n            Many are looking for something to keep them busy, let alone a new career.  Devise a method \n            of recruiting more of them into teaching!\n \n TORT REFORM\n \n1.      I know this is a high priority issue with you and you have done great things on the Supreme  \nCourt.  Getting the legislature to share your sense of urgency, particularly with the Senate leadership is going to be critical.  Lots of people and lots of organizations are doing lots of things, but it would be helpful if we could review with you  and your people  those efforts to see where the aces and spaces are.  High priority to turn up the PR aspects to drive the sense of urgency and communicate the personal devastating effect of these high liability awards on insurance rates and the concomitant effects-doctors leaving the state, businesses turning into a loss situation, or even electing to live without insurance.\n \nWATER\n \n1.      This is the biggest long term problem facing Florida-as big as education in my opinion. \nAgain, there has to be a paradigm shift as to how we think of this, and it is going to require controlling  policy  at the state level  and implementation at the regional level-just like DOT.  Interdependence of one region on another is a principle that will ultimately have to be adopted by all.   More on this when we brief you at the end of Jan. \n \n \nSTRUCTURE OF THE EOG\n \n                The country has probably never before seen a Governor with such a sense of urgency and             \n                 healthy discontent with the way things are.  Your ideas and vision for the state, resulted  in   \n                 many initiatives which created a tornado of activity in your office, straining the traditional \n                 staff structure to the limit. Creating initiatives took up most of your effort and attention, as   \n                 well as getting the legislature on board, being the front man on all these efforts.  And this is                           \n                 where Kathleen focused her effort too---your needs demanded that. \n \n                 What suffered was the follow-up on the execution orders given to your agency heads. \n                 I know that you have divvied up the agencies to your deputy chiefs of staff, but they are too    \n                 busy or too inexperienced  to effectively work with the department heads on a continuing   \n                 and participatory basis.  What you need, in my opinion, is a long in the tooth full time chief \n                 operations officer whose job is to regularly go to the agencies and work with them---at their             \n                 offices, to help them implement your orders.  You just don't have enough time to effectively                  \n                 do this, and neither does Kathleen.  That's exactly why I have a COO too-I just couldn't do           \n                 the extracurricular things that I do without him  That is why I think your merging the Sec'y \n                 of State's  function with DCF is a good idea, not so much because it makes sense from \n                 a functional viewpoint, but because it allowed you to attract an experienced manager \n                 who is in effect your chief operating officer for two agencies---taking some of the workload \n                 off you.  By finding someone like Glenda to take on the other agencies would help you \n                 immeasurably.    This is what a good LG might do. (?)  \n \n                 \nWell, Jeb, you have some of my thoughts for this year.  You are good at listening to advice, and also very good at masking your personal opinions until you are ready to announce an action plan.  But\nI would truly love your reaction to some of these items.  I have others I don't want to put in writing and would like to share with you in person but they are personal in nature-more about you and not the job.   I will wait until we can visit privately.  (Boy, do I feel emboldened!)\n \nAs always, love and devotion,\n \nAl.\n \n \n-----Original Message-----\n"

One of the Airmen mentioned to me that he thought you had missed to boat with the Black voters for some reason (I am sure you hear it all) and I thought I would give you a heads up that this event was happening.  I understand that Senator Nelson and I are being honored at the event.  I restored one of my early P-51 Mustang aircraft in the colors of their highest scoring pilot and was nationally voted in as an Honorary Tuskegee Airman last summer at their national convention in Atlanta.  I would not have mentioned this except the Senator was coming.  Just a thought, you might want to check with him and get his read on the whole deal.\n\nKermit Weeks\n"

        "body": "\nGovernor:\n \nFYI.  At least it appears to be getting better.  By my best estimate there are four separate groups advocating for the Home Education Community.   George Washington was absolutely right, and in this area \"we must avoid entangling alliances.\"   All the Best on Tuesday!  I will probably bring my \ndaughters to the ceremony.  They were in DC for the Presidential Inauguration in 2000.  \n \nKindest Regards!  JC     \n \n \nhttp://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/201/jfdoese.html\n \nHow to Speak DOEse - Theresa Willingham \n\nEarly last year, when I requested some material from the Florida Department of Education's Home Education office for our homeschool group, I noticed some inconsistencies on both the DOE website and in the homeschool packages. They were, I felt, misleading and inaccurate. Only one state support group was listed, along with disproportionate amounts of material from the Home School Legal Defense Association, creating an impression of endorsement and support of these private groups by a state agency. When I first pointed this out to the home education office, I didn't realize I was embarking on a nearly four month long email odyssey through the virtual, but convoluted halls of bureaucratic convention and apparent marriages of convenience between the DOE and other organizations. \n\n\n\"I think Florida is a great homeschooling state,\" I wrote to the office, in late January. \"I have some concerns, however, about the DOE sending out materials from the Home School Legal Defense Association. It pretty much amounts to providing free - and misleading - advertising for a private law firm. If you're going to include the HSLDA in your package, I would expect that other law firms would be included as well. \n\n\n\"The same issue appears with the preponderance of FPEA (Florida Parent Education Association) materials. There are many, many other resources for obtaining unbiased, accurate information for homeschoolers and I'm concerned that the Department of Education's Choice Office is simply taking the easy way out by supplying Florida homeschoolers with biased and possibly unreliable - or at best, misleading - information by a small but overbearing segment of the homeschooling community. Who can I address my concerns to for some specific feedback about these issues?\" \n\n\nAt first I received strong assurances that my impressions were wrong. \n\n\n\"We have placed the Home School Legal Defense Association literature in the district packets because the graphs and literature are helpful in describing profiles of some families,\" an office representative replied. \"There is no one organization that speaks for homeschoolers, and after my years in the area I try to be careful and balanced with people who contact this office. There are a couple of Q&A in the HSLDA that I have called about before you began to email me. In no way will this office ever give preferential treatment to any individual or organization....\" S he also added that she felt a telephone conversation about these issues might be more \"personal\" than email. \n\n\nI replied that I didn't wish to be personal but rather to discuss, \"with maturity and professionalism, the business of the Department of Education and the services you provide Florida residents.\" \n\n\nI think this is vital with any government agency: Communications should never be reduced to a \"personal\" level, in any sense of the word. All communications should always be in writing, dated, and specifically referenced whenever possible. It's important to have records of discussions, and that proved especially valuable in this case. Correspondence should be conducted as professionally as possible, keeping in mind that your communications will be saved as well. \n\n\nI didn't feel my concerns were adequately addressed, I explained, and asked if I should send my inquiries to another office. Almost immediately, I received an angry phone call from the person I'd been corresponding with. (I had given her my phone number when I had originally requested the homeschooler packages.) She was highly agitated, and proceeded to rail against what she called my \"unjustified accusations.\" When I tried to explain I'd only meant to suggest the DOE broaden its resources, and at another point that I was sure appearances of impropriety were inadvertent, she told me not to interrupt. The tirade continued for several minutes. When she finally stopped, I remained silent for a few seconds, then asked, \"May I speak now?\" She angrily replied, \"You can do whatever you want!\" \n\n\nSo much for the personal touch, I thought. But I held my tongue, uttering instead some benign comments that allowed us to hang up somewhat amicably. But I was shaken and upset. And the more I thought about it the more outrageous the whole thing seemed - that a DOE employee would actually call a citizen to complain about that citizen's input regarding a government agency that ostensibly existed to assist citizens! \n\n\nTwo days later, I took my issues, which now included the ill behavior of a state employee, to the next couple of levels - the employee's supervisor and the Commissioner of Education's office. I forwarded both offices copies of my correspondence with the Home Ed office, as well as a description of our telephone conversation. \n\n\nWhen I didn't hear back from either, I tried the Governor's \"Citizen's Help Desk,\" then went in search of an oversight agency. I knew there had to be one but had no idea where to start. I typed \"government watchdog\" in an Internet search engine, and among the offerings was the Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability (OPPAGA). Quite a mouthful; but the organization, charged with \"improv[ing] the performance and accountability of state government through reviews of state agencies and their programs,\" seemed to be just what I needed. \n\n\nBrowsing their site, I found a feedback form to \"contact us with information you may have regarding apparent program inefficiencies or mismanagement with state government,\" completed it and sent it in. \n\n\nA couple of days later, with no response from anyone, I followed up once again, with the rather plaintive subject heading \"Could Someone Please Respond?\" And I took a broader view of the problem, hoping to appeal to the supervisor more as a citizen, than as a homeschooler. \n\n\n\"My concern here,\" I explained, \"is that the antagonistic response I received does not invite communication. It does not encourage vital citizen inquiry or participation in this important aspect of our state government. Residents should be able to make a comment to a government office or leader without fear of chastisement or intimidation, no matter how much that office may disagree with the comment. We are governed by consent - this is what I teach our children. But communication is integral to that agreement between the governing and the governed, and I feel that perhaps [the coordinator] has forgotten this foremost principle of democracy.\" \n\n\nI said I had sent copies of all my correspondence and inquiries to multiple government agencies multiple times, and added, \"I write to you now, as one person to another, for a simple human acknowledgement of the concerns that I have as a citizen of Florida. I have copies of all my correspondence, and I stand by my observation that the DOE is not communicating well, efficiently or comprehensively with Florida residents - and so far, no one has made any effort to prove me wrong. I certainly hope that you will.\" \n\n\nI received an immediate and rather promising reply, with an apology from the DOE, and an invitation to \"start again.\" \n\n\n\"As an agency we make every effort to not become merely advertisers for products, but to provide as much information to parents as possible. ...Over the years many home educators prefer not to have an association with the department and we respect their wishes. Our mission is to help where and when we have the authority,\" I read. \"Please feel free to call me directly if I can be of assistance to you. ...If you have any other suggestions or recommendations regarding the web page on home education and how we can better serve families, please let me know.\" \n\n\nI responded enthusiastically, acknowledging gratefully the invitation to begin again. \n\n\n\"I suppose the reason I believe that I have not been served well by your office is because my concerns... have been dismissed out of hand,\" I replied. \"The reason I pointed out the impression of impropriety in the first place was because I was sure that, as you said, you don't want to be \"mere advertisers\" for products - including law services - and that's exactly what all the materials from the HSLDA seem to imply - that you are advertising for them. ...it doesn't seem right to solely endorse the HSLDA by providing so many of their materials - especially when the information they provide is readily available through unbiased, comprehensive federal DOE resources.\" \n\n\nI also saw this as an opportunity to open a broader dialogue for all homeschoolers in the state. \n\n\n\"Perhaps you've been told that many home educators do not want an association with your office,\" I wrote, \"but the truth is that most do not know that they CAN have an association with your office.\" \n\n\nA week went by with no reply. I followed up once, then again. I got a brief note advising me that the office was busy but that the resources I had sent earlier would be up on the website soon. Another week went by, and I followed up once more - just a line or two asking if my previous correspondence had been received and how the website updates were progressing. I received a short, terse note advising me that the legislative session was under way and that there were many other homeschooling parents who were equally as important as I, and that I would be attended to \"as soon as possible.\" \n\n\nI was being blown off and I knew it. Perhaps they expected me to be mollified by the initial note of apology. Perhaps they assumed that I would forget to check back on the progress of the website, or that if enough time went by, I would simply give up. I did neither. \n\n\n\"Is there someone else to whom I should be addressing my inquiries, so that I'm not taking up your time?\" I asked. \"You told me, specifically, \"If you have any other suggestions or recommendations regarding the web page on home education and how we can better serve families, please let me know.\" I responded comprehensively, politely, and with an interest in assisting in any way I can, and yet I continue to be made to feel as though I'm imposing on your office by communicating with it -- and expecting it to communicate back. \n\n\n\"So I'll apologize for bothering you, but will remind you that this is, indeed, our legislative session, and while I may not be among those parents lobbying for particular bills or special interests, I am among those parents whom you serve and whose interests and needs are just as important and just as deserving of respect and attention. ...\" \n\n\nBy now my letters were lengthy with copies of previous correspondence. I ensured the DOE knew that I had copies of everything, that I was paying attention to where we were in the conversation and focused on resolving the issues I had raised in the first place. Friends who knew of this now two-month-old conversation lamented my lack of progress. \"Couldn't your time be better spent elsewhere?\" they asked. \n\n\nBut I never leave things unfinished, and my principles were at stake. The website had been incomplete for years, and the homeschool information packages were inaccurate. If I quit now, nothing would change. And I knew that things would change if I persisted, politely, pointedly, and patiently. So I did. \n\n\nOn Feb. 25, I received one more note from the choice office, confirming that they were indeed, the proper agency for home education issues. \n\n\nWith an apparent air of resignation, the letter read: \"More often than not, other offices and divisions will forward correspondence and calls to us. Because the Department does not regulate or license private schools (and therefore private education) and given that home education is home based and true parent choice, there are very few program specialists in the Department that are familiar with issues that are not totally related to public education and the delivery of services as outlined in statute. \n\n\n\"And as you know, local school districts have at least one person assigned to respond to local home education questions and registration of students in home education. So send your correspondence to me and we will do what we can to assist you.\" \n\n\nI sent thanks, and reiterated my inquiries about department visibility and improved relationships with the homeschooling community, HSLDA concerns and the offering of comprehensive, unbiased educational resources on the website and in the homeschool packages. I never heard back from that office again. \n\n\nI continued to follow up weekly or every couple of weeks. I filed another complaint with the Governor's office, receiving a brief note that my letter would be forwarded to the Commissioner of Education's office. I replied that I had already done that and never heard back from them either, but hoped that perhaps the Governor's office could help. \n\n\nAfter a couple of weeks of silence, I wrote the Governor's office again. I received pseudo-apology: \"I am sorry that you feel that you have not been responded to adequately by the Department of Education and the Choice Office\" with a promise to forward my note once more and a wish that everything would soon be resolved to my satisfaction. \n\n\nOnce again, I got the distinct feeling that my efforts were somehow being redirected, with smoke and mirrors to distract me from the original problem. \n\n\n\"Thank you for your note,\" I wrote back, determined to keep the focus where it belonged. \"But the reason I feel that I have not been responded to adequately is because I haven't been. If you wish to apologize, apologize for the fact of the matter - that I have not been responded to adequately - and not for my \"feelings\" to that effect, as if the problems I've encountered communicating with the Governor's Office and the Department of Education are simply figments of my imagination. Thank you for forwarding my note again. I do appreciate it. But please understand that this needs to be resolved, not to my satisfaction, but because it's the right thing to do.\" \n\n\nThen, just when I was getting ready to write my Congressman, I received a note from the Office for Program Policy Analysis. I had almost forgotten them. \n\n\nThey wrote, \"We will be conducting a review of the Department in general later this year as part of the Legislature's Zero Based Budgeting initiative and will consider the input you have provided at that time.\" In the meantime, they added, perhaps I'd like to contact the DOE's Inspector General's Office. \"Hope this is helpful.\" \n\n\nWas it ever! I wrote to the Inspector General's office, mentioning that I had been referred by the OPPAGA and received an immediate response, inviting me to send them copies of all my correspondence with the DOE, and actually thanking me for bringing the situation to their attention. Two weeks later, on May 1, I was advised that my case had been turned over to - ta da! - the Website Master. It had only taken nearly four months to get everything to the department where it belonged in the first place, but now it was there with authority. \n\n\nA week later, I received a telephone call from a conflict resolution officer at the DOE saying he would like to implement the changes. He felt the best way to include new support resources was to accept information only from the \"legitimate representatives\" of state and local organizations, to verify that such information was being provided fairly and with permission. To that end, he asked me to send him information for groups of which I was the legitimate representative, and he would include them on the website. \n\n\nI thanked him and sent along all the information he requested. The only vagary occurred when I asked if there would be some mention on the website of how other home educators could submit information. \"We could do that,\" he replied, implying there was no intention of doing so. So when I sent my information, I assured him that as soon as the new site was up and running, I would let other area home educators know they could now have their support groups listed. \n\n\nOn May 21, I received a note telling me that the new website was up. Sure enough, besides the FPEA were our LIFE of Florida group, our local LIFE chapter and our national UU Homeschoolers group. There is no invitation to submit other groups, but word is out concerning how to do so, and hopefully new groups will soon appear on the site. \n\n\nIt took time, and it took patience, but when I look at the DOE website and know that what I see there now I made possible, I feel good, and strong, and reassured that I can affect the world around me, simply on the strength of my convictions. And that's a very satisfying thought. \n\n\nAn Update \n\n\nIn the intervening months, communication with the Department of Education's Office of Choice, now under new administrative guidance, has improved considerably for residents. I believe a number of changes are responsible for that, not the least of which was an ongoing DOE reorganization that was taking place at the same time that I waged for website improvements and better service for homeschoolers. But I believe only continued frank and frequent communications with the DOE (and any government agency), with requests for and strong expectations of, answers when we need them, and service when we want it, will best serve participatory democracy and our individual needs as home educators. \n\n\nAdditional Information \n\n\nSteps in Learning to Speak DOEse \n\n\n\u2022 First, learn your way around your state Department of Education. You can find your DOE's home page at http://www.ccsso.org/seamenu.html \n\n\n\u2022 Look for a Home Education or Homeschooling link on the state DOE page. If, after looking over the page, you determine that there is misleading or erroneous information on it, start at the beginning, contacting, via writing, the suggested \"help\" contact or administrator. \n\n\n\u2022 Present your case amicably and politely, always starting with the assumption that the state's error is mere oversight and that they'll be grateful for your help. That takes a lot more than a grain of salt, I know, but at least start with this assumption. And sometimes it simply is an oversight and they'll be happy to correct it. \n\n\n\u2022 I suggest waiting no more than two or three days for a reply before following up, with a dated copy of your previous correspondence. You don't need to say much, just wonder aloud if they received your first note and tell them you've attached it for their convenience. Remember that everything you say - and everything that they say -- will be public record, so be scrupulously polite, mature and professional, no matter what! \n\n\n\u2022 If, after two follow ups, you've either received no response, or an insufficient response, go up to the next level, that person's supervisor. That can be a little tricky. Sometimes relevant staff will be listed right on a webpage. At other times, you'll have to do some investigating. One thing you can do is simply call your DOEs help/parent/information number and request the name of the head of a department, or the name of someone's supervisor. Often, there's an online \"help desk\" or \"contact\" address, and you can inquire there. There are also online organizational charts or directories. Again, remain polite. No one needs a long story. Just ask your question. \n\n\n\u2022 After you've determined who the supervisor is, present your case again, this time with copies of previous correspondence to the other employee. Go through the same wait and follow up procedure. If you're still unsatisfied, go right to the State Superintendent or Education Commissioner and, with copies to your Governor's office, state your case once more. \n\n\n\u2022 This might also be a good time to start tracking down your state's version of an oversight committee for the DOE, because at this point, if you've received no proper response to your inquiries and concerns, the issue becomes one of government ethics. In Florida, it's the DOE Inspector General's office. I had to go through an outside government oversight group to find it, and that's yet another way to locate such an agency. But usually, you can just run a search on, say, \"South Carolina's Department of Education oversight\" and something will pop up. In many other states, it's an Inspector General's office as well. \n\n\nThere is an excellent overview of oversight agencies and their roles at the US Office of Government Ethics at www.usoge.gov/home.html. If you want to contact them, you need to write or call: U.S. Office of Government Ethics, 1201 New York Ave., NW. Suite 500, Washington, DC 20005-3917, Phone: 202-208-8000 , TDD: 202-208-8025, Fax: 202-208-8037 \n\n\nThe OGE is charged with, \"The Office of Government Ethics exercises leadership in the executive branch to prevent conflicts of interest on the part of Government employees, and to resolve those conflicts of interest that do occur. In partnership with executive branch agencies and departments, OGE fosters high ethical standards for employees and strengthens the public's confidence that the Government's business is conducted with impartiality and integrity.\" If all else fails, this agency can probably steer you to the appropriate state agency. \n\n\nAnother good resource is the University of Oklahoma's list of State Law Servers at www.law.ou.edu/stateserv.html State and Local Government on the Net, at http://www.statelocalgov.net/index.cfm is a magnificent compilation of links \n\n\nAt the Inspection and Oversight Document Archive, at www.lib.jjay.cuny.edu/ig/ftpidx.html you can find the names and addresses of each state's oversight agency. \n\n\n\u2022 Be prepared to present your case clearly and with documentation. It may seem silly to have progressed so far up the chain of command for what is probably a minor problem. But if an agency refuses to work with a citizen, then there is no other recourse than to turn to the oversight agencies in place for this reason. To do anything less is to do nothing. \u00a9 2003 Theresa Willingham \n\n"

        "body": "\n\nDear Governor Bush\n \n  I am writing to you for several reason but my top priority right now is the Bush/Lang case. I have written to you in the past about this child and to date the issue has not been resolved. The state has sent out many mixed signals and finally there is a fair hearing on Jan 14 03 as far as we know. The problem is the family lives in Washington State and can not be here for the hearing however I have offer to attend but it appears as though that is not a comfortable situation for those involved. I am aware of another case that took place on Oct 30 02 where the adoptive family who is from Maine was allowed a phone hearing. In the Bush/Lang case everything that was ordered by Carol Hutcheson had taken place however she decided at some point to not review or make a decision on the adoption subsidy request. Again this was after Carol telling the family to submit medical documentation, after she had denied the child based on race. Medical documentation was sent but than went on to a hearings officer shortly after, to date there has not been a denial on the medical. We were under the impression that the fair hearing would be on the denial for race, now we are finding that the hearing will include the medical as well. The adoptive family also has not gotten anything thing they have requested ie: the entire policy manuel and the documentation the state will be presenting, they have not had the same access to info the state has had. Almost all of the cases I have received in the past four years concerning children adopted from Florida have been those children of black or mixed race, who have been denied equal access to a Federally Mandated Program \"Title IV-E\" . Something is certainly wrong here. We have asked that this case be investigated. We have also found that Mike Watkins is no longer with the department. How can you have someone work with this family who is no longer available? It appears as though Florida is not a family friendly state. My next concern is from a family who contacted me on 12-30-02 to say that they have given an agency in Longboat over $8000.00 two years ago for a bi-racial child (in Carol's word bi-racial is a special condition therefore making those children highly sought after) to date they have not gotten a child and do not have contact with the agency. I feel that maybe this agency has taken their money with full intensions of not finding a child. My point is I e-mailed Carol Hutcheson to ask were we would direct our complaint and still have not hear from her. Do you have any ideas that may help this family? I feel we need your assistance in resoling these issues. Thank You for all your help.

The board on Dec. 5 adopted new rules for itself that included halving the president\u2019s term to one year and stripping away some of the presidential power. \n\nGiuffrida _ halfway into her two-year term as president _ filed an appeal with the state, arguing that the board cannot change the term of office midstream for the person serving as president. She also asked state Education Commissioner Richard Mills to overturn the district bylaw changes and rule on the validity of the board\u2019s rule changes.\n\nMills ruled on Tuesday that the state would not stop the officer elections at Thursday night\u2019s board meeting. \n\n\n\n\n\n  _____  \n\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!

        "body": "\n\nMr. Bush,\n \nI am a private practitioner in New Smyrna Beach and am very concerned about how fragile the environment for access of medical care has become in the area.  I know that you have been made aware of this problem recently from one of my patients, David Biddulph.  I have felt powerless in this situation since it began when BFMC merged with Halifax Medical Center several years ago.  I did not realize the potential implications that this affiliation could have until about one year ago when the contract with Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Florida was terminated.  Just this month I had to terminate my relationship with about 100 patients because Aetna\u2019s hospital contract with BFMC was also terminated.  This situation has infuriated these and several hundred Blue Cross patients just within my practice.  These citizens pay taxes for this hospital and cannot use it!  I was a Blue Cross member myself and had the luxury of being able to change that situation.  Most of the patients are retirees from large corporations in the north and have no say about their insurance coverage.\n \nSince Mr. Biddulph and I first talked about this situation only about four weeks ago, we have enlisted most of the active members of the medical staff at BFMC and have patients signing a petition in support of a citizen vote for the future of our only hospital.  The response has been tremendous so far.  It seems rather obvious that a vote would be appropriate to gauge what the tax payers want to do with their hospital.\n \nYou will soon be making five appointments to the Southeast Volusia County Hospital Taxing District Board. I hope you will consider the petitions of citizens who support four candidates who have pledged to give voters the opportunity to decide the future of Bert Fish Hospital. Those four applicants are: Dr Susan Hole, Michael Thompson, Pastor Robert B Thomas and David Biddulph.\n \nMany citizens, including myself, feel we have been left out by your predecessor's appointees who reached an agreement to affiliate with Halifax behind closed doors. Those meetings were later found to be unconstitutional. Now when we ask them for information about the contract negations between Halifax-Fish and Blue Cross, we are told the information is not public.  \n \nMany wonder if Florida Health Care, a wholly owned subsidiary of Halifax-Fish, is being given preferential treatment in \u201cnegotiating\u201d their reimbursement rates. While the public has no access to current information, the court-ordered release of minutes from the secret meetings between Fish and Halifax board members revealed the fact that the contract between Florida Health Care and Halifax was \u201cintentionally under priced\u201d so the hospital would not make any money and the profits would go to Florida Health Care.\n \nSince the affiliation a few years ago, our taxes have been increased by your predecessor's appointees over 40%. Thousands of homeowners, including myself, have been without the use of the hospital for almost a year. It appears that thousands of Aetna clients will also be denied use of Bert Fish Hospital as of the first of the year. \n \nSeveral doctors have closed their practice and many others are considering the same because of the loss in revenues and impracticality of using hospitals outside the area.\n \nThe election these four applicants are committed to would be non-binding and involve an additional expense. We would want every registered voter to be mailed a ballot and a complete voter guide that in plain English gave the pro and con arguments for each of three proposals as follows:\n \n1.\tContinue the current \u201cAffiliation\u201d with Halifax Hospital \n\n2.\tReturn Bert Fish to a stand-alone hospital \n\n3.\tEnd Bert Fish Hospital\u2019s \u201cAffiliation\u201d with Halifax Hospital and join with a reputable non-profit or for-profit hospital group which offers to end property taxes while providing continuing care to the indigent. \n \nMr. Bush, almost ten years ago you supported the idea that voters should decide about new taxes, will you now help the citizens of Southeast Volusia County Hospital Taxing District have their voice heard about the future of the hospital they voted to build with a new tax over 50 years ago?  Please consider these applicants as they may be the only chance that a fair environment for both access and providing medical care can exist in this community.\n \nSincerely,\n \nGreg J. Mercurio, MD\n(386) 426-2972\n \n \n"

We moved from Tampa to Wesley Chapel in 1986, so my kids could grow up in the country, have horses, and learn about a more peaceful living. We cherished our home and the country living!  All that has been changed a year ago when Sturgess Construction began to clearcut over 200 acres right next to us and elevated the land several feet. Not only we had to contend with the never ending assault of dump trucks, dust blowing as in the Sahara, but now we have also been flooded. The entire neighborhood is under water, and where horses grazed in the pasture just a couple years ago, now we have 2-3 feet of water. We never had problems with the water since we live here. Never been flooded, in fact my pond was almost dry during the recent drought.\n\nAlong with my neigbours I called SW Florida Water Management, filed a complaint with Pasco County, called the engineering firm (Burcaw Inc.) and talked with the engineer in charge of the project (Chapel Pines on 577 North of State rd 54), but no response and no help so far. Water that was contained in the pond 200 feet from my house is now 10 feet away and is getting closer. Same for many of the neighbors.\n\nThanks for your help in advance!\n\nMelitta Lovland\n\n6142 Ellerbee Rd.\n\nWesley Chapel, 33544\n\n(813) 973-3747\n\n\n\n\n  _____  \n\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!

        "body": "\n\nAfter a long conversation with one of Florida's movers and shakers about the state of our business here in Florida; believe I will support IA Business Manager Joe Humphreys for our new State Film Commissioner.\n\nI did some research and found out the week Rebecca decided to step down from office, she called and/or emailed Joe with a push to go after her soon to be open spot.\n\nI myself have seen Joe go from set to set and visit not only with IA members, but with all crew. Finding out what everyone's problems were and how they might deal with them.\n\nI know the Producer from the Denzel Washington project that shot Miami and he thinks also that Joe would be a great replacement for Rebecca and take up where she has left off.\n\nHe has tried to write new law for IA and it's members. He has come up through the ranks as a crew member and knows the ins and outs of our business and it's strong and week points from the Florida crew person's view.\n\nHe knows the above and below the line pro's and cons. I've seen him talk common sense as well as Union Fact and Rule when facing a problem. Talking as a Floridian crew member trying to make a living first and IA Business Manager next. He thinks of his members as humans with families first and the rules apply where needed next.\n\nWe need someone in that office that understands film production and how it is a business more than someone with a political agenda. We need someone who knows the producers face to face and how to talk their language. Not someone who knows how to schmooz politicians.\n\nI have been told by Rebecca and Kathy and all the other Film Commissioners I deal with that Jeb Bush wants facts, figures and solutions not dinners, cigars and smoke blowing.\n\nIf you give him real talk by the people who know what's going on and the problems we face and solutions to help make them better; he will listen and help as much as he can.\n\nJoe Humphrey's is that person. I wish we had a Joe Humphreys running this states SAG office and/or the national. I believe I would be better served.\n\nAs a member of several unions DGA, SAG, AFTRA, AEA as well as WIF know that people from each of those Unions know Joe and have heard his ideas on how to make their Unions better for Florida. They have heard his ideas on how to bring work home to Florida. They have heard his ideas on how to unite this state in the fight against runaway production.\n\nI believe Joe is the best for this position because he listens to all areas and knows the who's who and watches who helps, who fights and who is full of hot air.\n\nI follow his wake from time to time to find out who I should network with and who I shouldn't. My work load has grown by doing so and I think Florida would grow from having someone who knows our business from the inside out not the other way around.\n\nThe fact remains if Rebecca thought enough to push him towards this position why shouldn't we.\n\nI want a leader to replace Rebecca to see her great start to high goals finished. I want someone who brings solutions to our dying business and it's problems. Someone who uses common sense and by listening to it's people to make options and solutions. Not someone who will run to Jeb Bush and state government and say you need to fix this and I don't know how. Someone who is supported by the \"In The Trenches Working Film Crew members and Producers of Florida\" because this person is and has always been an \"In The Trenches Working Crew Member.\"\n\nThe only other people I would support for this office are: \nSuzanne Mercado, Bill Hill or Ex- Texas Governor Ann Richards\n\nJust my opinion.\n\nGo Joe Go\n\n\nGrady Bishop\n2nd Unit Director / Stunt Coordinator\nEXTREME STUNT & DRIVING TEAM\nDGA / SAG / AFTRA\n5429 S.

I have persuaded my good friend Bill Bonner of Daily Reckoning fame to give us a special preview of his new book \"The Soft Depression of the 21st Century: How to Survive the Crisis of Degenerate, Mass Capitalism,\" (working title) due out in September. In it, he and fellow Daily Reckoneer Addison Wiggin, argue that popular democracy, aging populations and bad economic theories doom the US and other Western economies to follow the Japanese model, with recession, bear markets and failing consumer spending over the next 10 to 15 years. (Heavy stuff, I know... ) \n\nI read The Daily Reckoning almost every day. It's part of my morning ritual. In fact, I wrote to Bill last year to tell him that there are times when I feel like a house painter in front of a Rembrandt as I read his commentary. He is that good. In the following essay - which he tells me will comprise a portion of the finished book - he takes issue with economist Paul Krugman's position that America's current economic malaise has been caused by a return to pre-Depression free-market capitalism. \"Au contraire,\" says Bonner, \"today's markets with their collectivized risks are anything BUT the capitalism enjoyed by the world's capitalists prior to the 20th century.\" \n\nIt's a strong read, worth your time and I hope you'll enjoy it. \n\nAfter the essay, I will show you how to get The Daily Reckoning for free - no strings attached. Now, let's see what Bonner and crew have worked up for us: \n\n******** \n\nCOLLECTIVIZED RISKS by Bill Bonner \n\nFew popular economists have written as much about Japan's troubles as Princeton professor Paul Krugman. His views appear regularly in the New York Times and other media. \n\n\"Here is a hypothesis,\" he suggests, offering an explanation for the strange events of the last 12 years, \"the world became vulnerable to its current travails, not because economic policies had not be reformed, but because they had. That is, around the world, countries responded to the very real flaws in the policy regimes that had evolved in response to the Depression by moving back toward a regime with many of the virtues of pre-Depression, free-market capitalism. However, in bringing back the virtues of old- fashioned capitalism we also brought back some of its vices, most notably a vulnerability both to instability and to sustained economic slumps.\" \n\nKrugman imagines a kind of social contract after the Great Depression in which voters agreed to tolerate capitalism, but only with safety nets and regulations to make sure no one got hurt. In his mind only, these restraints produced a stable prosperity in which the benefits were shared out among the population during the '50s, '60s and '70s. \n\n\"The America I grew up in -- the America of the 1950's and 1960s,\" he says, \"was a middle class society. Yes, of course, there were still some rich people, he admits, but [thank God!] \"there weren't that many of them. The days when plutocrats were a force to be reckoning with in American society, economically or politically, seemed long past.\" \n\nKrugman was writing to an appreciative audience in the NY Times magazine in October of 2002. Typically, he then lets himself get distracted, worrying that the rich may be making a comeback. The nation's top 100 CEO's compensation rose from an average of just $1.3 million in 1970 (in 1998 dollars) to $37.5 million in 2000. There are not enough of these super-rich to fill a zoning department in a mid-sized town, yet Krugman is so indignant about it he misses the important point altogether: the triumph of laissez-faire capitalism, which conservatives celebrate and Krugman rues, was a sham. \n\n\n\n\n  _____  \n\nADVERTISEMENT\nWall Street's loss is your gain! \n\nThe market lost 28.9% over the last 6 months. But Dennis Slothower's \"Stealth Stocks\" -- companies overlooked by Wall Street and the media -- returned profits of 44.67% ... 49.29%... 52.89% ... 93.01% ... 111.71% ... even 258.13%. \"My Stealth Stocks don't make news,\" explains Dennis. \"They just make money.\" For a free report on 5 new \"Stealth Stocks\" poised to double in the next 12 months -- including a red-hot medical equipment company with an astounding 413.4% earnings growth -- find  <http://216.234.238.178:8000/ss?click&InvestorsInsight&3e16424e> out more.\n\n\n\n  _____  \n\n\n\nBy the close of the 20th century, true capitalists had almost disappeared from the face of the earth. \"Capitalism,\" was a pejorative term invented by Marx to describe a system in which the rich owned the means of production and exploited the masses. The system Marx described never really existed the way Marx imagined, though a casual observer with a chip on his should may have been tempted to see it that way. Marx then made a prediction: that the inevitable grind of history would put the means of production in the workers' hands and cut out the capitalists. \n\nMarx's economics were as fanciful as his history. But at least one of his predictions proved correct - though not at all in the way he thought. As the champagne glasses were hoisted and the new millennium rung in, it was the Marxist vision that had triumphed, not the laissez-faire vision of Smith and Turgot; the means of production were owned by the workers. (Curiously, the most laissez-faire economy in the world in 2001 was in Hong Kong -- a city under the direct control of still-communist China.) \n\nEven the very rich CEO's that galled Krugman were only hired guns - not genuine capitalists. Their extravagant pay levels was testimony not to the victory of raw capitalism, but to its defeat. Real capitalists would never allow managers to take so much of THEIR money. \n\nModern corporations are owned by small shareholders, not big ones - usually through collectivized holdings in pension funds, mutual funds and so forth. These small holders have neither the gumption, power nor the incentive to resist absurdly high executive salaries. Even CEOs of companies whose earnings were falling - or who were approaching bankruptcy - were paid as if they were star quarterbacks in the super-bowl. \n\nMaybe they were especially talented and maybe they weren't. But the mere fact that they are paid so much, and appeared on magazine covers, seemed to awe the little shareholders and impress the analysts. The great mob of investors takes up the stock of these celebrity managers with no serious thought about them - and too small an interest to justify serious investigation. \n\nMass capitalism not only produced mass delusions, but also a new shareholder arithmetic. It may make sense for Warren Buffett to look carefully at executive compensation. As a substantial shareholder, much of the money that went to over-compensate key employees would have otherwise have gone to him. But the two or three cents a small stockholder might have at stake makes serious investigation not worth the trouble. \n\nStill Krugman is so outraged he doesn't even notice. The nature of capitalism changed dramatically in the 20th century. In America and Japan, free-wheeling laissez-faire capitalism of the 19th century gave way to a consensual, collectivized, capitalism of the 20th century -- a Kapitalismus Leicht, with massive state involvement and mass participation by people who wouldn't know a balance sheet from a bed pan. \n\nCapitalism in America was not the same after the Roosevelt Administration finished with it. But this was merely part of the bigger trend - toward a capitalism directed by government for its own purposes...and for the interests of government's beneficiaries. Share ownership became increasing widespread. In America by the end of the century enough people owned shares to elect a president. Share ownership rose from under 5% of the population at the beginning of the 20th century to fully 56% at its end. \n\nLike any large group of people removed from the facts or from direct experience, shareholders were as subject to mass emotions as a group of football fans or a lynch mob. With only 'public' knowledge to go by, they could be readily whipped up by the financial media, and were ready to amplify any fad to the point of absurdity. \n\nThe first large movement of mass capitalism took place in America in the 20s. Share ownership was uncommon in 1900. There were only about 4000 stockbrokers in the whole country. Thirty years later, the number of brokers had increased more than 500%. Stocks became such a popular subject that even shoe-shine boys had an opinion on them. The Dow shot up from 120 on the first day of business in 1925 to 381 at the peak in '29. \n\n\n\n\n  _____  \n\nADVERTISEMENT\n#1 Stock to Beat the Market.\n\nBeat the market. Any market! With this #1 stock. It\u2019s hand-picked by leading market analyst and stock picker Ben Zacks. He\u2019s proven he can pick stocks that beat a bear and trounce a bull market. In fact, over the past six years, his #1 picks have beaten the street by 548.8%. Usually in just 30 to 90 days! That\u2019s nearly six times the return of the S&P 500 during the same period.

Unlike previous busts, the '30s brought suffering to the entire nation, not just a handful of rich capitalists. A quarter of the workforce lost its jobs. In '31 and '32 more than 5,000 banks failed. The bear market on Wall Street dragged on and on...with the Dow not returning to its '29 high until 1954. \n\nFor the first time too, voters demanded that their government 'do something'! The Roosevelt Administration did something, of course. It rushed to the scene with a program of monetary and fiscal stimulus, following the most recent fads in macro-economics. Never before had such forceful intervention been attempted. And never before was an economy so unimpressed. Instead of bouncing back as it had following the Panic of 1873 or the Bust of 1907, the nation lay down in a gutter of recession, bankruptcy and sluggish growth. - and stayed there for the next decade. Even then, it seemed to take the biggest war in world history to pry the poor fellow up again. \n\n\"Too little, too late,\" was the professional opinion of the leading economists. Government had made a good attempt - but not massive enough, or fast enough. \n\nAnother interpretation, out of step with the fashions of the day, was that the government's own efforts to help the economy out of its funk had actually made the situation worse - by stretching out the painful readjustments that needed to be made over a long period of time and at much greater cost. \n\nEither way, it was a New Era in capitalism. For now, government - often acting through its bureaucrats at the Federal Reserve - promised to soften capitalism's rough edges; to put into place safety nets that would protect people from serious injury, on or off the job, and to manage the nation's monetary and fiscal policies so as to ease the pain of the downward slope of the business cycle. Henceforth, budget deficits would become an economic tool, and not merely a convenience for pusillanimous politicians, unwilling to raise taxes to pay for their programs. And henceforth, interest rates would not be determined by the market, based on the supply of savings and the demand for it. Instead, interest rates - at least at the short end of the interest-rate curve - would be set by the central bank for the good of the economy! \n\nKrugman believes that during the '80s a neo-conservative push to \"deregulate\" loosed the capitalist dogs from their leashes while also reducing inflation levels in most developed countries. This return to pre-Depression policies inevitability led to Depression-era economies, he thinks, which explains Japan in the '90s - and America in the early 00s. \n\nIf anyone can figure out how the shallow deregulations in '80s America produced the long malaise in '90s Japan, he is not working on this book [sic]. Capitalism was adopted by the Japanese following the war - almost grudgingly. But Japan's collective capitalism never bore much resemblance to the raw capitalism of Krugman's imagination. And even in America, the Reagan-era reforms hardly changed the nature of late-20th century capitalism. Barely a single thread in the massive public safety net was unraveled. \n\nGovernment spending went up by every measure -- as a percentage of personal income, in nominal dollars and in real ones. The fundamental trend towards mass, collective capitalism accelerated. By the end of the century fully half of all American households were little pseudo-capitalists. And of them, nearly half counted the majority of their wealth in the form of shares in public companies! \n\nBy the end of the century, America had become the Shareholder Nation - every bit as obsessed with stock prices as Japan had been ten years earlier. Risk has been collectivized - so that hardly anyone feels immune from slump. Investors have lost money. Salarymen have lost (will lose) their jobs - almost unthinkable in Japan. And the government, too, has lost revenue. \n\nScarcely noticed by economists of any persuasion was the way in which government became a partner in the managed, risk-averse capitalist systems of the late 20th century. By fits and starts, governments throughout the developed world have increased their share of GDP during the entire century. \n\nIn short, government is no longer a spectator. It has become the biggest participant in the, supposedly, free markets of the western world. It has become the biggest spender in consumer economies... and the biggest borrower. It controls money and credit. It is the watchdog on the capital markets, its chief observer, and its chief beneficiary. \n\nIn America, following the collapse of the stock market bubble in 2000, the effects were visible almost immediately on government budgets at ever level. In Japan, the nation's budget went from a surplus of 2.9% of GDP in 1991 to a deficit of 4.3% in 1996, as interest came down. \n\nIn Japan, as in America, neither the government nor the central bank could sit by idly as the wealth and economic power of the Japanese imploded. Instead, they took the action Krugman and others urged on them - and made the situation worse. \n\n********** \n\nYou can get Bill's Daily Reckoning for free by visiting http://www.dailyreckoning.com/sub/MWave.cfm.

To me, they are the first environmentalists and the only people who actually live in the Everglades.  They are very much about doing the right thing for the Everglades no matter what the neoenvironmentalists think. I am confident that they will stand beside you if you take the tough stands necessary to move the restoration forward. The Tribe has  also enlisted the support of many Lake Okeechobee people in their efforts to move Mod Waters forward. I am sure that you are acquainted with Gail Powers of the Lake Okeechobee Business Owners (LOBO).  We are all concerned that if we don't move things visibly forward soon on Mod Waters, that we will lose both public and Congressional support for our efforts. I am confident that together we can move things forward. \n\nRegards, \n\nJoette\n"

The non-profit organisation I represent, the Caribbean Network for Integrated Rural Development (CNIRD), having been the Regional Secretariat for the United Nations International Year of Volunteers (IYV) 2001, has now embarked on a follow-up project to establish a Volunteer Centre in Trinidad and Tobago.\n \nTo this end, we contacted the Florida Association of Voluntary Agencies for Caribbean Action (FAVA/CA) for their assistance in sourcing facilitators to conduct a workshop with leaders of volunteer agencies towards the establishment of a Volunteer Centre.\n \nWe soon received correspondence from Ms. Natasha Marks, FAVA/CA's International Programs Coordinator, informing us that the search for facilitators would begin soon. That was in September of 2002.\n \nBy early November 2002, we were well underway with preparations for the workshop, which was held on 4 and 5 December 2002. December 5 held special significance as it is recognized worldwide as the International Volunteer Day.\n \nThree competent and professionals facilitated the two-day workshop - Dr. Jill Canono and Ms. Amieko Watson of Volunteer Florida and Ms. Carol Hodnett of Martin Volunteer Resource Centre. With a small group of 15 NGO leaders, we were taken though the conceptual steps of creating a mission statement, defining the services it would provide and some fundamentals of volunteer management.\n \nAll the participants gave glowing praise to the three women, who came well prepared and led the group through a had but exciting session. Many complained that two days was not enough!\n \nSince then however, the core group of participants has met once and further discussed the next steps. It was decided that CNIRD would serve and the Secretariat for the Centre for the year 2003, while the necessary structures, funding and other support were determined. Our target is 5 December 2003, when we will officially launch the Volunteer Centre, in its own space and with its own staff.\n \nGiven CNIRD's regional mandate and in the spirit of Caribbean unity, strength and prosperity, the Volunteer Centre concept is one that in time we will spread throughout the region.\n \nWe are therefore pleased to tell you of the effective collaboration and cooperation between Florida and Trinidad and Tobago and we look forward to further successful relationships between our two countries.\n \n \nSincerely\n \nNatasha Nunez (Ms.)\nProgramme Associate\n \n \n \nCaribbean Network for Integrated Rural Development (CNIRD)\n40 Eastern Main Road, St. Augustine\nTrinidad and Tobago\nPhone: (868) 662-6473\nFax: (868) 662-2612/645-5936\nEmail: cnird@carib-link.net\nWeb: www.cnird.org\n"

        "body": "\nPam Hackett\n8949 N. W. 9th Place\nPlantation, Florida 33324\n(954) 472-3824\n \n                                                December 20, 2002\n \n \nDear Jeb,\n \nRegarding the class size amendment that the people foolishly passed:   \n \nFirst I would like to tell you who I am.  I am a lifelong Republican and have served on the Broward Republican Executive Committee since 1991.  I have followed education issues in Florida since I moved here in 1973.  All four of my children went to public schools here in Plantation.  I continued to study education issues when I worked for Senator Jim Scott for six years, and more recently as I worked for Rep. Bill Andrews for the past eight years.  \nOn the amendment, I would like to join any effort to get it repealed.  Second, if the amendment is going to be implemented, I believe that decisions about how money is spent should be taken out of the hands of the school boards.  I know the trend has been to provide more local control, however, there has been little or no accountability for school boards that fritter away money on consultants, shoddy construction work, and promoting the agenda of the National Education Association and the local teachers\u2019 unions.  Third, while the teachers\u2019 union is publicly making \u201cnice\u201d with you and other Republican legislators, they continue to undermine education reform measures, and because school board members rely heavily on the unions to get elected and re-elected, they pretty much call the shots on local policies. \n \nBelow are listed just a few of the things going on in South Florida:\n \n1.\tLegislation passed over a year ago \u2013 your bill that required school districts to give full credit for years of service \u2013 designed as an incentive for teachers to come to Florida is being undermined by the teachers\u2019 union:  They negotiated a ten year cap on credit for service \u2013 this is their way of discouraging teachers from moving from one district to another and protecting seniority.  In spite of a memo sent out by the Department of Education, David Ashburn, school districts are not complying with the law.  They insist that this measure does not take effect until January 7, 2003, where the School Code rewrite specifically removes the issue from the collective bargaining table.  (I am told that this was a topic of discussion at the recent school boards\u2019 meeting in Orlando, so it is obviously going on elsewhere too).\n \n2.\tIn Broward County:  Although the school district employs people to keep track of student capacity, they haves hired consultants for $1.5 million to evaluate the district\u2019s capacity and project future needs.  As a taxpayer I can only wonder if the district staff cannot do the job, why do those people remain on the payroll?    \n \n3.\tMiami-Dade:  In 1997, we discovered that the school district was spending 66% of their 2 mil dollars (specified for capital outlay) on salaries and disposable items.  Currently they have an oversight committee that must okay spending.  This happened due to the district buying untested and uninspected land \u2013 not to mention a plethora of contracts that have been awarded without bids.  (It\u2019s not just the school district that is corrupt \u2013 the former airport manager and his wife go on trial next month for accepting bribes).  \n \n4.\tPalm Beach County \u2013 In a convoluted land swap deal, the City of Delray Beach is buying land and pushing people out of their homes to relocate a high school from a neighborhood that wants it to remain, to a location where senior citizens oppose it.  The current location is among the highest elevations in Palm Beach County, and there are several buildings on it that were built or renovated within the last five years.  If the school is relocated, not only will existing buildings be abandoned, they will be rebuilt at the new location (which the school board rejected at least twice as unsuitable).  Professional architects estimate that the cost of building on the new site will be between $5 million and $20 million more than rebuilding on the current site, retaining the sound buildings. (You have been receiving petitions and correspondence opposing this move of Atlantic High School).  In addition to the higher cost (which could be used to build other schools) students traveling on foot will have to navigate on and off ramps of I-95, a railroad track, a cement plant, and an intersection that ranks sixth in Palm Beach County for accidents.  \n \nThe public is constantly being told (through the teachers\u2019 union) that the Legislature does not adequately fund education.  The truth is, the school districts are not held accountable for the way they spend it.  The few times that they are \u201ccaught\u201d spending inappropriately, they pay the fine with current dollars \u2013 taking it from the classroom.  This hurts the kids, and certainly does not change their behavior.  \n \nMany say that accountability for school board members comes at the ballot box.  That may be true in some instances, but too often the public keeps re-electing board members because they are not informed of their true records, or they have given up trying to change the entrenched bureaucracy.    In the last election in Palm Beach County, a political unknown ran against the chairman of the school board because he is the driver of the above land swap.   She was able to garner 44% of the vote in the short time between filing and the election.  But, because of new school board member districts, the people who will be most affected by the deal could not vote because they do not live in the district.  \n \nI hope you will use this information as a springboard for changing the system.   Without changing the current system, a lot of children will continue to be left behind.\n \nPam Hackett\n \n \n"

        "body": "\n\nJeb,\n \nAs I mentioned at the end of the State Technology Office Transition Team meeting last week, I recommend that the State of Florida provide its citizens with permanent e-mail addresses.  The state and its people would benefit tremendously from universal, reliable, life-long e-mail connectivity.  As I'll outline below, there's a need for it, and it will greatly accelerate adoption of your vision for how technology will change the way the people relate to the government and the government to the people.\n \n*\tUniversal E-mail Connectivity is Needed in Florida (and Everywhere Else) \n \n*\tE-mail addresses now are unreliable and unsuitable for the personal needs of most of Florida's citizens - they are a function of e-mail users' non-permanent relationships with e-mail service providers, who generally fall into one of three categories: \n \n*\tEmployers, who terminate the e-mail account when the employee is no longer employed, and who often limit usage of the account to the employer's official business \n \n*\tInternet service providers, whose e-mail service is lost when the subscriber terminates or changes his/her ISP service, and \n \n*\tInternet portals such as Yahoo, who generally provide basic e-mail service that is free, but that comes with significant unattractive features, such as \n \n*\tRelatively modest maximum file storage limitations unless the user pays for enhanced service \n \n*\tLimited available names and idiosyncratic naming conventions that result in e-mail addresses such as jebb55049@yahoo.com, which don't present a professional impression to e-mail recipients, and therefore make the use of such e-mail services less helpful for some purposes such as job hunting \n \n*\tUnreliable service - portal-sponsored e-mail addresses sometimes stop working for no apparent reason, without any real hope of getting service restored \n \n*\tInclusion of branding messages or advertisements at the bottom of every outgoing e-mail (e.g., \"Do you Yahoo?\") \n \n*\tBecause their e-mail accounts aren't permanent and/or reliable, most people would not choose to let government agencies or businesses send them important communications via e-mail \n \n*\tIf they were receiving vital correspondence via e-mail, termination of their e-mail account would expose them to a risk of not getting some important messages, and require them to notify dozens of government agencies, businesses and other parties of the change \n \n*\tThe economically underprivileged would especially benefit from a permanent e-mail address - see the Miami Herald article at this link: \nhttp://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/local/states/florida/counties/broward_county/4797915.htm\n \n \n*\tUniversal E-mail Connectivity Would Accelerate Implementation of Your Vision for a More Efficient, Citizen-Sponsored State Government \n \n*\tA permanent, reliable, e-mail account would provide the impetus many Floridians need to switch over to receiving important correspondence, such as notices of license renewals, vehicle registrations, property appraisals, tax bills, etc., via e-mail, thereby saving substantial mailing costs \n \n*\tIf citizens receive communications from government agencies via e-mail, they will be much more likely to use the state portal for the purposes you envision \n \n*\tEncounters such as a drivers license renewals are more likely to be completed online if they start online through e-mail-based renewal notices that include a link to the portal site at which drivers licenses may be renewed, and instructions for electronic renewal \n \n*\tSimilarly, citizens will be more likely to read helpful, relevant information found on the state portal if they are made aware of it via e-mail that includes a link to that information \n \n*\tThe more transactions that are conducted online through the portal, the more it will spawn even more portal awareness and usage \n \n*\tAlthough we can envision many wonderful uses of universal e-mail connectivity, I 'm convinced that many of the best uses are beyond our imagination right now, and will be identified only after the system is implemented \n \n*\tThe Challenges are Relatively Modest \n \n*\tSpam - could be handled through a no-call list like phone solicitations, or through spam filters that are in use now by e-mail service providers \n \n*\tHacking/viruses/information security - handled the same way as e-mail security is handled by e-mail service providers now \n \n*\tCost - the cost of the equipment and telecom services needed to provide e-mail service is falling; fixed costs of equipment and infrastructure would be spread over so many subscribers that the average cost per account would be very small, and the marginal cost of adding one more e-mail account would be infinitesimal \n \n*\tThe State could recover much of the cost in savings of paper, handling and postage from e-mailing rather than physical delivery of correspondence with citizens \n \n*\tIt would be nice to get all of the state, local and federal government agencies and businesses who use the state e-mail platform to pay for that privilege - maybe offer some enhanced services to sending agencies such as electronic return receipts for a fee \n \n*\tfor state and local governments within Florida, the Legislature could mandate giving Floridians a choice as to whether to receive official correspondence electronically via their Florida e-mail account, and require a small \"click charge\" be paid by the sending agency to the State's e-mail fund for every e-mail communication \n \n*\tStatus of e-mail account when people move out of Florida \n \n*\tThe state could terminate the account, or make former residents pay to keep it active, but I recommend letting our \"citizens emeritus\" keep their accounts without charge \n \n*\tThe marginal cost of providing the e-mail address is low, and the cost of enforcing a \"citizens only\" rule is high \n \n*\tIt's good branding for the state and its technology vision for a former Floridian living in Virginia to be using his/her Florida e-mail address \n \n*\tOther states may follow Florida's lead in offering e-mail service, and Florida would benefit from the use of other state-provided e-mail accounts retained by people who move to Florida \n \n*\tUniversal e-mail addresses would drive Internet access and usage, especially for the underprivileged, chipping away at the digital divide issue \n \n*\tIn addition to public libraries, we'd see Internet kiosks at many more places accessible by the underprivileged \n \n*\tOther citizens generally already have adequate Internet access at work and at home \n \nWith universal e-mail accounts for life, Florida could lead the nation in providing its citizens something that is inexpensive to provide, but very useful for its citizens, and efficient for state government operations as well.  Please let me know what I can do to help you evaluate this idea, and implement it if you decide to move forward on it.\n \nThanks again for allowing me to serve on the Transition Team, and giving me the chance to provide input on ways to realize your technology vision.\n \nBest regards,\nMichael\n \n \nW.

Davis (E-mail).vcf\n\nDear Governor Bush: \n\nI am writing to direct your attention to a proposed contract the FWC is currently negotiating with the Central Bank of Missouri.  First, allow me to introduce you to eAngler.com.  eAngler is a technology company, located in Tampa, Florida, that caters to anglers of all types.  We primarily sell fishing tackle online throughout the US and internationally, with a large portion of our sales to residents of Florida.  In addition to fishing tackle, we sell Florida fishing and hunting licenses through a contract awarded by the FWC in May of 2000.  We have sold over 61,000 licenses since we began selling in October 2000 and that number has been growing 100% annually.\n\nIn July of 2001, I participated as a speaker at your IT Town meeting held in Tampa.  The purpose of the IT Town meetings was to promote/attract technology companies to Florida.   This is the reason I am writing.  The FWC issued an \"Invitation to Negotiate\" in August of 2002 to invite companies to propose on providing an automated point of sale system for the sale of fishing and hunting licenses.  The ITN also covers the consolidation of telephonic and internet sales of licenses along with the point of sales.  Three companies submitted their qualifications and two were disqualified, leaving the FWC to negotiate with the Central Bank of Missouri.  eAngler partnered with one of the disqualified parties.  The Central Bank of Missouri will charge residents of Florida and nonresidents, who wish to enjoy one of the great resources of this State, $2.25 per license.  This represents a 15.4% increase in the cost of purchasing a license online compared to eAngler's $1.95 per license.    \n\nThe initial term of our contract with the FWC will expire this May.  Our contract has a provision for 3 one-year extensions.  By all accounts at the FWC, we have exceeded their expectations and when we have been asked to participate in other efforts of the FWC, such as supporting the Florida Bass Conservation Center and the Florida Big Catch program, we have gladly agreed.  It is my opinion that entering into a contract with the Central Bank of Missouri is inconsistent with the stated objective to attract technology companies to Florida.\n\nI am respectfully requesting your office contact Mr. Ken Haddid and Ms. Susan Weaver of the FWC to urge the FWC to consider extending eAngler's contract for the remaining 3 year extension period as a show of support for one of Florida's technology companies.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. \n\nRespectfully, \n\nMichael B. Davis \nPresident and CEO \neAngler, Inc. \n<<Michael B. Davis (E-mail).vcf>> \n\n"

        "body": "Cc:\tJeb Bush\n\nMr. Clark, \n\nThank you for your response to my e-mail.  I appreciate all that has been done to help provide Emma Noelle with access to healthcare. \n\nI do realize that DCF does not handle changes in Medicaid providers; however, they do handle the information that is placed in the file.  Because of DCF's insistence on keeping the birth mother's name on the file even though they were informed several times that her parental rights were terminated, Emma's medicaid plan was changed without my knowledge and neither I nor my attorney were able to change it back to the original plan.  It took me nearly two months, repeated phone calls to a line that consistently rang busy, and when calls did get answered I was repeatedly told to call a different department.  I was also repeatedly passed back and forth between AHCA and DCF.  DCF forwarded me to four different departments until I finally asked for the name and telephone number of the acting local director whom I called twice, call never returned.  In the midst of all of this I was told by someone at DCF that this baby was not even mine and that I did not have custody of her.  Yes, I have worked with Gilda Ferradaz on this situation, but only after numerous phone calls back and forth between AHCA and DCF.  Someone at DCF gave me Ms. Ferradaz's name and number and specific instructions on what I needed to tell her to do to get the plan switched, which included taking the birth mother's name off of the file and putting my attorney's name on.  I faxed Ms. Ferradaz all of the adoption related documents I have and the name was finally changed on the file.  (Again, please keep in mind that I attempted to provide DCF with the adoption information and my attorney's name and phone number in June.  Actually, my first e-mail to Governor Bush was in late June to request help with extending Emma's medicaid until the adoption because both my attorney and I were told by DCF that it could not be extended.  Even after my e-mail I was told by DCF that they could not extend it because Emma did not have a social security number or birth certificate.  I said if necessary I would e-mail the Governor again, and only then was it extended; however, they kept the birth mother's name on the file even though I repeatedly offered to provide documents indicating that she had already signed to terminate her parental rights.)  Ms. Ferradaz called to inform me that it was taken care of and that I could call Doris Rivera to follow-up.  I called Ms. Rivera on December 12.  I was told that the change back to the original plan would take effect January 1, 2003.  I was told that until then I would have to take Emma to a clinic in Naranja.  I explained that Naranja was approximatey one hour from my home.  I also explained that Emma had a heart problem that required a follow-up visit.  I was told I had to take her to the clinic in Naranja to get a referral.  I questioned when and why the change occurred without my knowledge.  Ms. Rivera explained that the birth mother was notified of the change.  I asked how the birth mother could be notified when her parental rights had been terminated.  (Please note:  Ms. Rivera used to work for DCF and was the person I initially dealt with in June.)  Ms. Rivera then said that they were waiting on documents from me and would have changed the name in June if I would have provided the documents.  Of course I became upset because I tried so hard to give DCF the documents and the attorney's contact information in June.  Even my attorney attempted to call DCF.   I then decided to e-mail Governor Bush to request assistance, and to make him aware of an appalling situation.  I am glad I did e-mail him because I was in for another surprise!  I recieved an urgent call from Lydia Cardelle on December 23, 2002.  She said she had just received the information from Gilda Ferradaz that very day and it would be taken care of and that it would be effective FEBRUARY 1, 2003!  I asked her how that could be because I was told by Doris Rivera that it was effective January 1, 2003.  She said that Gilda Ferradaz did not give her the information until December 23, and if she had it by December 17 she could have processed it for January 1, 2003.  I was also initially told by her that I may be financially responsible for the doctor visits from October - December.  After a lengthy discussion I was told that the doctor will have to absorb the costs and that I could continue to see the regular pediatrician as long as the pediatrician's office requested a waiver prior to the visit.  On December 26 I received Emma's new medicaid card from my attorney.  I thought it was a little too quick for the attorney to receive the card from the medicaid office and forward it to me, when I had just spoken to Lydia Cardelle on December 23.  I decided to check the date I e-mailed Governor Bush and discovered it was on December 12, the same day I spoke with Doris Rivera.  I then called Ms. Cardelle back again and asked her to please double check the date Emma's plan would become effective.  She again confirmed that it would not be effective until February 1, 2003.  I then asked her if Doris Rivera worked for the Medicaid office.  She confirmed.  I told her that I already received Emma's new card from my attorney, and that I spoke to Doris Rivera on December 12.  I then reminded her that she told me they could have made the switch effective January 1, 2003 if they had been provided the information by Gilda Ferradaz by December 17.  I told her receipt of Emma's new card and my e-mail to Governor Bush documented my telephone conversation with Doris Rivera at the Medicaid office as December 12; therefore, all blame should not be placed on Gilda Ferradaz and DCF.  She told me there was no problem because even though the plan will not be effective until February 1, 2003, I can still take her to my pediatrician as long as a waiver is requested. \n\nI am happy to know that I can now continue to take Emma to her regular pediatrician.  Unfortunately, I am shocked to find out that after everything I had been through and was told throughout the two months, the plan had never actually been switched back to the original medipass plan.  And I would not have even known it if not for my e-mail to Governor Bush.   \n\nI apologize for the length of this letter, but I feel it is important to make you aware of this situation, not for me, but for the people who may experience similar frustrations but lack skills to help themselves or their children.  This situation has made me more aware of and sensitive to the challenges and frustrations of the less fortunate in our community.  As an educator I used to wonder why my students would miss an entire day or even two days just to go to a doctor's appointment.  (Growing up my mother made our appointments either early in the morning or late in the afternoon so we would only miss half the school day.)  I also did not understand why my students did not go to see a doctor for certain illnesses or injuries when medical attention was necessary.  I now understand that even though they had medicaid, it still was a very frustrating and lengthy process.    \n\nPlease understand that I do not blame anyone for this situation; however, I suspect that my situation is not unique.   I hope you recognize that there were numerous problems throughout the entire process so that the problems can be corrected and not replicated.    \n\nAgain, thank you for you help. \nHave a nice day! \nSandy Moise\n"

NO. 02-4772E\n       \nDear Shan:\n\nOn August 20, 2002, you wrote a letter to Ms. Leah Kelly, Director, Exceptional Student Education, regarding my July 6, 2002 letter to you sent via electronic mail in which I addressed the Broward County School Board pattern and practice of \"... denying the parents of students with disabilities the opportunity to receive a due process hearing in a timely manner due to the school district's use of a form response regarding the availability of alternative dispute resolution...\"  In your letter to Ms. Leah Kelly, you clearly state, referring to the specific form used by the School Board of Broward County:  \"...The second set of choices, above, seems to suggest that if the parents request state mediation, they must agree to waive the 45-day requirement for a due process hearing.  As you and I discussed, this is not consistent with the requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).  Specifically, section 300.506(b)(1) of title 34 of the Federal Code of Regulations (Title 34) states, \"The procedures must ensure that the mediation process-(i) Is voluntary on the part of the parties; (ii) Is not used to deny or delay a parent's right to a due process hearing under Sec. 300.507, or to deny any other rights afforded under Part B of the Act...\" Thus, even if the parents agree to explore alternative dispute resolution procedures like mediation, they are still entitled to simultaneously pursue the due process hearing proceedings within the specified timeframe.\"  (Emphasis added).\n\nAs the forwarded message from Ms. Grace McDonald, Due Process Coordinator, from Broward County School Board clearly indicates, it seems that regardless of your August 20, 2002 letter and the fact that this is the law and has been the law for years, the Broward County School Board and its representatives, including the school board lawyer, continue their same pattern and practice denial of the due process rights that parents have under IDEA and under our state laws, specifically those indicated above under 34 C.F.R. 300.506 relative to mediation.\n\nThe Broward County School Board denied A.A. the related services of occupational therapy based on an evaluation conducted by an occupational therapist employed by the School Board.  The parents disagreed and requested either provision of the needed related services of OT for A.A. or an independent OT evaluation at public expense.  The School Board of Broward County denied both and the School Board, not the parents, filed a request for a due process hearing against A.A. to determine whether or not A.A. should be entitled to the independent OT evaluation at public expense requested by his parents.\n\nMs. Grace McDonald, Broward County School Board Due Process Coordinator, sent me the electronic message that I am forwarding to you in its entirety, which in part reads:\n\nIn a message dated 1/6/03 9:15:45 PM !!!First Boot!!!, mcdonald_grace@bcpsgw.broward.k12.fl.us writes:\n\n\n\nDue to several other cases being scheduled during the month of Jan., Mr. Marko and I are available on the following dates, Jan. 24, Jan 27, and/or Feb 3, for state mediation. \nIt is my understanding from an email you sent to Margot that the parents are interested in participating in State Mediation relative to this due process.  \nIt is further my understanding that the parents are not willing to waive the 45 days in order to participate in state mediation.  Since I believe the 45 days would be concluded on or about Jan. 29, it will not be possible for state mediation to occur without waiving the 45 days.\nPlease let me know by tomorrow whether the parents have changed their position regarding the waiving of the 45 days,  in an attempt to participate in state mediation.  If so, please indicate which of those three dates would be the most convenient so that I can notify Dr. Stetler.  \n\nIf I have not received written verification of the parents willingness to waive the 45 day requirement in order to participate in state mediation by tomorrow afternoon at 4:00, I will assume that we are going forward with the hearing on Jan. 15th.  I will then provide to the parents the documents we intend to introduce and the potential witnesses we may call on Jan. 8 as is required by law 5 days prior to the hearing.  (Emphasis added)\n\n\n\nAs an advocate on behalf of students with disabilities in Florida, I cannot say that I am surprised by the actions of the School Board of Broward County.  The State of Florida Department of Education has failed and continues to fail to hold any school district in Florida accountable for violations of the state and federal laws enacted to protect the rights of children with disabilities and their parents.  Rather than holding school districts accountable for continued violations, the Bureau of Instructional Support and Community Services enables school districts to continue to violate the law with complete disregard of the rights of children with disabilities and their parents.  The only enforcers of these laws in Florida are the parents themselves and with no enforcement tools available to them, their success is very limited.  However, we continue to trust that our beloved Governor's plan to reorganize the State of Florida Department of Education includes holding the Bureau of Instructional Support and Community Services accountable for its continued failure to uphold the law in Florida on behalf of children with disabilities and their parents, so that Florida stops leaving behind children with disabilities.  \n\nPlease communicate in writing no later than 4:00 P.M. today, as requested by Ms. McDonald, your intentions regarding A.A.'s right to participate in state mediation without using mediation to force the parents \"to waive the 45 day requirement in order to participate in state mediation,\" which as you clearly indicated in your August 20, 2002 letter to Ms. Leah Kelly, is not \"consistent with the requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA),\" so as not to delay the due process hearing, which, in this case, has been initiated by the School Board of Broward County against A.A.  \n\nSincerely,\n\n\nLilliam Rangel-Diaz\nCENTER FOR EDUCATION ADVOCACY\n8600 S.W. 92nd Street, Suite 204\nMiami, Florida  33156\n\ncc:  Administrative Law Judge Stuart Lerner\n       Division of Administrative Hearings\n       Tallahassee, Florida  \n"

School Bd. of Seminole County, 783 So.2d 1231, Fla. App. 5 Dist. 2001).  What hope can parents of children with disabilities possibly have to access due process and to have hearings conducted in a \"fair and impartial\" manner when the Bureau of Instructional Support and Community Services continues to perpetuate these blatant violations of the most basic rights of children with disabilities and their parents?   Parents have to continue to be the enforcers of the law because the Bureau of Instructional Support and Community Services continues to fail to hold school districts accountable.  If the parents must be the enforcers of the law, then the parents need tools to access due process in a \"fair and impartial\" manner.  The first step must be that ALJs or hearing officers must be trained by an entity other than the Bureau of Instructional Support and Community Services on the special education laws enacted to protect the rights of children with disabilities and their parents so that due process hearings are necessary, they can be conducted in a \"fair and impartial\" manner.  \n\nMr. Woodring, as I have written before, \"o\n\nur democracy is based on a system of laws that is supposed to be enforceable. It is designed so that attorneys will help to enforce those laws. When a group of people are cut off from having equal access to the legal system, we no longer have democracy.\"  I urge you and the Governor's team in charge of the reorganization of our Department of Education and the review of the proposed ESE rules that children with disabilities and their families be provided with the access to our democracy that they have been denied for so many years and that the necessary steps will be taken so that the Bureau may no longer be able to cut off children and parents from having equal access to our legal system.\n\n\n\nI remain at your service,\n\n\nLilly Rangel-Diaz\nMiami, Florida\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

My husband Bob and I appreciated your hospitality. Your home is beautiful and it was a lovely evening. We regret that we are unable to be in Tallahassee for the inauguration, but are there in spirit.\n\n \n\nAs I mentioned at the Christmas Party (while breaking away from the topic of the concrete industry), Orange County Public Schools has been working very hard to make reading a key focus in our community. One of our newest efforts has been to partner with WKMG Channel 6 to video tape dignitaries reading a children's story. The segments will be aired in January/February. Our slogan \"Reading is the Key\" is becoming recognizable throughout the community.\n\n \n\nWe would love to arrange to have WKMG video tape you reading a children's book. We have selected books that are short in length for primary students. Please let me know if it would be possible to make the arrangements for this.\n\n \n\nWe are also working to create a partnership with our parents and caregivers to support them in the early years of parenting. I know that the family's role in education from birth to age five is also something which you have expressed an interest in and we would love to coordinate an interview with you on this topic. \n\n \n\nOnce again, thank you for your hospitality. Bob and I believe in what you are doing for Florida and you may always count on our support. I look forward to hearing from you.\n\n \n\nSincerely, \n\n \nGayle E.

We have enjoyed the open dialogue and it has been a privilege to be part of the discussion on how Florida gets control over drugs.  As you know, we are not a well funded group of professional policy drivers.  Florida drug policy reform efforts come from ordinary voting American's who want to find real solutions for the crisis we have because of drugs.  Most of us see the effects of prohibition on our families and in our neighborhoods, then long for a better way.\n \nI know you are a man of order and compassion.  Some friends of ours have worked together to create an on-line presentation of A Drug War Carol.  Dickens's Classic Tale is retold when the US Director of Drug Control orders the arrest of a medical cannabis using patient on Christmas.  www.adrugwarcarol.com is the link.  It is an excellent representation of the reasons I believe prohibition is not the answer.  I hope you will make some time to read the story.  The links are helpful and the art work is tremendous.\n \nWe would like to invite you to help us find a way to get real control over the problem of drugs in Florida.  On March 26, 2003 we have arranged for Judge James Gray to be at the University of Central Florida Orlando Campus.  He is working with a group of students with the local NORML Chapter and the UCF Progressive Council.  We would be honored to have you attend the meeting with Judge Gray.  Judge Gray's bio is below.  We are certain that by allowing you, panel members of your choice and Judge Gray to create a dialogue that we can find some innovative solutions.  We know that the citizens of Central Florida are anxious to support a forum of this nature.  We are certain that the media would cover such a debate.  Groups like NORML , the Progressive Council and Students for Sensible Drug Policy are forming on every campus.  They are ready to follow an innovative leader.\n \nWe hope you will help us choose a format for the forum that allows for questions and answers.  If you would like a several person panel, please let us know who you would like to be involved.  We realize your schedule is busy but we hope you will personally attend rather than send an associate.  The violence on the streets and the depression that is destroying teens lives can be managed with strong leadership.  \n \nAgain, we are not a group of well funded diplomats, we are residents of this state who want a safe place to live  As you know I am raising children in this state and I don't want to leave the legacy of problems we are facing to my children and your children's children.\n \nThank you for your consideration of our request.  You will find Judge Gray's bio below the banner.\n \nI look forward to receiving my invitation to the summit shortly, the address remains the same as last year.\n \nSincerely,\nJodi James\nExecutive Director.\n \n\"Under a government which imprisons any unjustly, the true place for a just man is also in prison.\" ~ Henry David Thoreau\n \n <http://www.flcan.org/> Florida Cannabis Action Network - Welcome to the Harvest\nJodi James ~ Executive Director\n \nBio of Judge James P. Gray as adapted from MPP/SSDP 2002 Conference Biographies\n \nCited on numerous occasions for his work in the areas of both social and civic philanthropy, Judge James P. Gray currently presides over the civil trial calendar for the Superior Court of Orange County.  Throughout his 25-year career within the legal and judicial community, Judge Gray has not only donated hundreds of hours of volunteer time to existing community service organizations, he also has created and implemented a number of innovative programs of his own, each one a success story in itself.  His efforts to stop the problem of drunk driving and to encourage children to stay in school have been particularly noteworthy.    \n \nAlthough Judge Gray has championed many causes, none has been more bold than his work to combat the illegal drug problem in America.  Gray continues to mobilize civil leaders, government officials, corporation, non-profit organizations, the media, and the public across the country to join him in exploring alternative solutions to reduce this chronic problem.  \n \nIn addition to his ongoing civic activities and philanthropic work, Judge Gray has been an adjunct professor at Chapman University, the College of Trial Advocacy for new Orange County attorneys and the Continuing Legal Education of the Bar.\n \n \n"

As my policy expertise lies primarily in the field of education, I will offer a few brief observations and suggestions as you and your team begin your work.\n\n \n\nOver the last four years, you and Lt. Governor Brogan have done tremendous work on behalf of Florida\u2019s students and their families.  From creating new educational grants like the Opportunity and McKay scholarships to reorganizing the State Department of Education, your leadership made Florida a national leader in education reform, and especially in providing real parental choice in education.\n\n \n\nI urge you to continue expanding school choice options by making it easier to create new charter schools. As you know, charter schools can be a driving force in helping our students, particularly those in academically at-risk schools, prepare to meet the challenges of the global economy, through use of rigorous, world-class academic content. \n\n \n\nFlorida students could also benefit from expanded access to public virtual or cyber schools. Virtual schools can utilize powerful technology to deliver outstanding academic content to children regardless of where they live or what their educational needs might be. Expanding public virtual education will require lowering numerous barriers, including: revising charter school and/or open enrollment laws to allow for off-site education; ensuring adequate per pupil funding levels; and, maintaining a focus on achievement and academic outputs, rather than on burdensome regulations. In the interest of full disclosure, let me add that I helped found a company called K12, which provides a rigorous, research-based curriculum to virtual public schools in seven states.  Through test scores, parental satisfaction, and third party reviews, our schools are showing strong academic results and success.\n\n \n\nDon\u2019t stop holding educational leaders and schools of every type \u00ad whether traditional brick-and-mortar, charter, or virtual \u00ad accountable for academic performance and results. \u201cInnovative\u201d is not necessarily a synonym for \u201cexcellent,\u201d and \u201ctraditional\u201d is not always \u201coutdated.\u201d\n\n \n\nBest wishes, we are proud of you, and grateful for you,\n\n \n\nBill Bennett\n\n"

I can't imagine a less demanding inquiry. However, instead of simply telling me the ages the first person I spoke with referred me to the Website (I was unable to locate the ages there even after an extensive search). The second person left me on hold for a while, even though I said I could not hold, and then guessed at the ages based upon the birth year. She only looked up the birth month at my insistence.\n \nThey wasted a lot of time for me on deadline on what should have been a routine question and answer and they were just plain sloppy. \n \nNow, I know you've had a difficult time with the press - although not with this reporter - but I can't see how anyone benefits from shoddy work like this. I am convinced it does a disservice to the office of governor, which I respect, and to you, who I also respect.\n \nYou should also know that upon my arrival here in September my courtesy call to the press office and suggestion that I  looked forward to working with them was received with outright skepticism, which is not an attitude a professional would express at that time. \n \nFurthermore, let me add that as an honorable person who takes pride in their work, I no more enjoy being treated like a suspect than you do.\n \nRespectfully Yours,\nVictor Epstein\n"

        "body": "Cc: David.Struhs@dep.state.fl.us\n\n\nDear Governor Bush:  I hope that our State DEP can do something about the rise in mercury in Florida fish (see story below). Perhaps more regulations should be considered and restrictions on industrial waste products. This news could really hurt our economy in the tourism sector.\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nMore fish added to state's advisory list on dangerous mercury\n\nFt. Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel\nStaff and wire reports \nPosted January 7 2003 \n\nBiologists have asked state health officials to add several marine fish species to a forthcoming health advisory that warns Floridians about eating mercury-tainted fish.\n\nThe state is finishing the wording on the advisory and could make brochures available to the public as early as next month, said Bill Parezik, a Health Department spokesman.\nResearchers at the Florida Marine Research Institute have called for limiting consumption of cobia, little tunny, blue fish and crevalle jack.\n\nThey also have found data suggesting another fish, greater amber jack, should be added to the list, said George Henderson, a senior scientist with the Florida Marine Research Institute in St. Petersburg.\n\nThe list of freshwater Florida fish covered by consumption warnings won't grow with the new advisories, said Scott Hardin, a fisheries official for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.\n\nBut he said the state may change its location-by-location listing of mercury warnings for three freshwater species -- largemouth bass, gar and bowfin. The warning for all three probably will be extended statewide because of new mercury findings. Areas where it is clearly safe to eat those fish will be listed as exemptions to the blanket warning.\n\nLevels of mercury in marine fish in Florida have remained stable in recent years, Henderson said.\n\nIn the Everglades, where some of the highest mercury readings once occurred, levels are dropping in large predatory fish, Hardin said.\n\n\"Mercury is heading downward in the Everglades, where we had the most difficult levels,\" he said.\n\nLevels in Everglades fish that once warranted warnings against any consumption have dropped to levels permitting limited consumption, Hardin said.\n\nEnvironmental officials attribute the improvement to regulations on mercury burned in municipal and medical waste incinerators in South Florida.\n\nSince 1989, the state has issued public health advisories warning about the potential risk from fish taken from various waterways. The last advisory was issued in 1997.\n\nMercury in large enough doses can damage the human nervous system and harm the development of fetuses. Women of childbearing age and children younger than 10 should not eat more than 8 ounces of the fish on the list in a month, and everyone else should not eat more than 8 ounces a week.\n\nOther proposed updates to the marine advisory would warn against consuming part of any shark more than 43 inches long and limit eating smaller sharks and spotted sea trout more than 20 inches long, Henderson said.\n\nThe proposed advisory also recommends that people in the Florida Keys should cut down on eating snook, red drum and permit.\n\nAn updated mercury warning has been delayed for more than a year because state health officials wanted the language to be simple and easy to understand without causing people to stop eating fish altogether.\n\n\"I'm frustrated the advisory has not come out sooner,\" Henderson said.\n\nBut he said there are conflicting studies to sort through on mercury's effects.\n\n\"They're in a quandary,\" Henderson said of health officials. \"They're trying to give good health advice. One part of that is to eat fish. The other part is to limit your consumption of certain fish.\"\n\nStaff writer Neil Santaniello and the Associated Press wire service contributed to this report.\n\nSantaniello can be reached at nsantaniello@sun-sentinel.com or 561-243-6625. \n\n\n\n"

Irene is a warm, witty, and highly intelligent woman of high principal.

Yet while clearly a partisan Republican, she is liked and respected by people of both parties. Irene Guy is universally considered to be a fair, able and loyal person, capable of performing any job at the highest level.\n     Her appointment to this position will do honor to your commitment to maintaining a fair, modern and reliable election process. Her appointment would be popular with the people of Hillsborough County, and would further your own reputation of appointing skilled, competent, and fair people to positions of great public trust.\n    I very much appreciate your consideration of these words in support of Irene Guy.\nRespectfully,\nHerbert M.

We have just started to approach our elected representatives and have been surprised at the support:\n\n     A. Every elected Commissioner, the Mayor and Chief of Police of Oak Hill have signed the petition asking you to nominate the four candidates including Mike Thompson, a long term resident of this small city (Note: Faxed to Mavis today) \n\n     B. I have been told that you will be receiving petitions from several members of the New Smyrna City Commission. They support the right of the citizens to vote on the future of Bert Fish. They also reported deep frustration with our hospital who now refuses to accept both Blue Cross and Aetna insurance. Last year the city changed to Aetna from Blue Cross so their 200 plus employees could again use the hospital. Today the city's employees have no access to their hospital and Aetna is asking them to complain to the insurance commissioner about the hospital's refusal to accept patients at the \"standard\" reimbursement rate of 120%of Medicare.\n\n4. Robert Thomas, applicant from Edgewater, is the Pastor at the largest African American church in New Smyrna Beach. He reported that everyone asked, signed in the hopes that you would end their frustration over being left out and nominate candidates who would give them a voice in the future of their hospital. (Note: These signed petitions have been faxed to Mavis)\n\n5. Dr Susan Hole, applicant from Edgewater, has started to collect signatures from other doctors and the results are instructive. While over a dozen doctors have signed (Note: I faxed the Doctor's petition to Mavis today), several have refused. Dr. Ownby, applying for a second term from Edgewater, refuses to let the people vote because they might \"negatively impact funds for indigent care.\" Several other doctors would sign but are afraid of losing business from Florida Health Care, a subsidiary of Hallifax-Fish.\n\nJeb can you help us reverse the policy of your predecessors appointees who made a decision to merge our hospital behind closed doors and give the citizen-petiton-signers across the political spectrum a voice in deciding the future of Bert Fish Hospital?\n\nCan we get together to discuss? \n\nJeb have you ever run a campaign in a one-man one-vote election that didn't have an election day?     \n\nWould you recommend we do an overnight poll to test the water? :)\n\nThe good news is that the election results will be clear. :)\n\nDavid Biddulph\n\"For Voter Approval of Bert Fish Hospital's Future Direction\"\nPhone: 386-423-4744\nCell: 386-405-6559\nEmail: odemocracy@aol.com \n"

They have\nbeen involved in adoption proceedings for\nthree-and-a-half years.  Several times, case workers\nhave given Ken and Lisa a date when the adoption would\nbecome final, but each time it has been postponed. \nNow, I am told that the judge has on his desk an order\nto remove the children from my brother-in-law's home,\nawaiting only his signature for enactment.\n\nThese children call me \"Uncle\", and it breaks my heart\nto think that they might be taken away from our\nfamily.  We have spent Christmases, Thanksgivings,\nEasters and family reunions together.  The children\nhave grown to be as much a part of our extended family\nas their many, many uncles, aunts and cousins who were\nphysically born into it.  Their grandparents love\nthem.  My father-in-law died peacefully this past\nApril, secure in the belief that Brandon, Aren,\nCheyenne and Misty, his only grandchildren, would\ncarry on his memory.  The people at our church love\nthe children and inquire about the status of the\nadoption every time we see them, as do the members of\nseveral other churches where the kids have made\nfriends.\n\nWe are not a wealthy family, but we are comfortable\nand reasonably well educated.  I sincerely believe\nthat this extended family can provide the support\nnetwork that the children need in order to have a\nsecure and happy upbringing.\n\nIf there is anything at all that you can do to bring\nthis adoption into being, you would be working a\nmiracle in the lives of four innocent and much-loved\nchildren.  Thank you for any help that you can give.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nJohn S. Dobbs      \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo! Mail Plus - Powerful. Affordable.

Thank you for working with the City of New Smyrna Beach.\n \n     The reason for this e-mail is a concern I and my fellow city commissioners have with the inabilty of using our local hospitals under our current insurance carrier.  You may be aware, that Bert Fish and Halifax hospitals do not accept Blue Cross or Aetna Insurance as payment in their facilities (except for emergencies).  The City of New Smyrna Beach  uses Aetna for many of its employees health care benefits.  With this current situation, our city employees as well as many of our citizenry are being forced to look outside our city for hospital care.  \n       \n     This should raise concern for all elected officials in that we have a situation where two of the largest insurance  carrriers in this state are not recognized at two of our local tax supported hospitals.  \n \n      Please give this matter your utmost attention when you choose the next board members for Bert Fish Hospital.  New Smyrna Beach residents and employees deserve to be able us utilize local care facilities for any health care issue that they might encounter. \n \n      Thank you for taking the time to read this e-mail and for your attention to this very serious matter.\n \n \nRepectfully,\n \n \n \nJames W.

People were killed when their auto crossed Interstate I-4 median.\nI refer to the accident January 2, 2003, when Andrew Knapek and Christophter\nMcConnell were killed when their auto crossed the median on I-4 and struck\nan\noncoming truck.  I fully believe that this was possibly preventable - if a\nmedian barricade was in place.\n\nIn the early '90's on I-4 between Lakeland and Tampa a median barricade was\nconstructed after several publicized median accidental crossovers resulted\nin\nfatalities.  When I-4 was widened in the mid '90's the barricade was not\nreplaced.  I think this is unacceptable.\n\nToday I returned from an auto trip from Virginia and noticed that several\nstates have Interstate barricades in the median that are simply three (3)\nstrands of cable that will \"catch\" a vehicle crossing the median and help\nprevent a head-on collision.\n\nWe need to do everything reasonable to make our highways as safe as possible\nand I fully believe that Interstate median cable barricades are a reasonable \njustification of highway tax dollars.\n\n                    Sincerely,\n\n\n\n                    Terry C.

This came from Secretary Dr. \nOtis Bowen's and my concern over the seriousness of the same issue at \nthat time, since both of us had experienced the consequences as \nphysicians in practice. I am including a portion of a message from Dr. \nDonald Palmisano, President-Elect of the AMA. He and our own Florida \nphysician, Dr. Yank Coble, current President of AMA, are completely \ninvolved in this crisis as it covers the nation. Dr. Palmisano refers \nto a current report on the issue from HHS which you may want your staff \nto know and to access. This may already be in your files, but just in \ncase.\n\nPortion of article:\n\n\"Because of the powerful external validation of what AMA and the rest \nof organized Medicine has been saying for years, I try to include in \nevery medical liability interview the excellent report of July 24, \n2002, \"Confronting the New Health Care Crisis: Improving Health Care \nQuality and Lowering Costs by Fixing Our Medical Liability System\", by \nHealth and Human Services (HHS) concerning the problems with the \ncurrent medical liability system.\n\nIn the live TV interviews during the past 4 days, I was able to mention \nit and give the web site of HHS.GOV where the public can download the \nreport.\nThe advantage of this is that those who want more information can read \nthis important study from a government source\".\n\nAgain, best for your continued success......Bob\n\n"

        "body": "\n\nHi Jeb:\n\nFirst, let me congratulate you again.  I am writing this as you are being sworn in.  What a historical moment! I hoped to make it to Tallahassee, but this week marks my last semester of Law School.  My thoughts are with you.  You have an exciting four years ahead of you.  \nI truly admire those who are fortunate enough to live their dream of public service.  I continue to work for those I believe in (I seem to have a better track record for others :) G-d has a plan!  Who am I to argue)?  Anyway, I do want to give you my thoughts on a judicial candidate interviewing this week.  His name is Ed Curtis.  I have known Ed for a number of years and I am familiar with his background.  He has what it takes.  As I get closer to the legal profession, I feel compelled to advocate for those who will have the power to interpret our laws, and will do so with integrity.  Much depends on the character of those who wear the judicial robe.   Ed has experienced a great deal of triumph and adversity, which only served to make him stronger throughout his life.  He maintains positive energy and a desire to make a difference.  He works hard and plays hard, but most importantly, his seasoned legal experience will be a tremendous asset for those who will come before him as a judge.  His intellect, along with his compassion and commitment to serve is something to be admired.   \nI have worked hard over the last few years to support and advocate for those who I believe will serve us best. There is no doubt that Ed is one of the best!  I am sure you will interview many fine candidates, and I just wanted to share with you my thoughts on someone I admire and know will make an excellent addition to our judiciary.  \n\nAll the best,\n\nEllyn\n\n\n\nEllyn Setnor Bogdanoff\nEBS Consulting\n(954) 767-9850\nFax (954) 767-4701 \n\n"

Without more taxes, without digging deeper into everyone pockets, without it costing the school or the parent more money and without begging to people for donations.\n\nI have really build up our non-profit company as well and can aid Florida with receiving LARGE E-rate refunds from the Federal government. AND we have just found a loophole in a federal law that can allow your districts to apply for large amounts of your teachers and admins salaries to be refunded to the district from Federal and it is retroactive for 2 years.\n\nI called Brewser a month or so ago and he didn't remember me at all. He had a lovely lady call me back to see what I wanted and who I was. After telling her she was so enthusiastic about the AmEdu project but Brewser still didn't call back. He had invited me to the Florida budget meetings but when I tried to follow up he was un-contactable.\n\nJeb, after all these years and all the trials & tribulations in our families and in our country, couldn't we plan a time to chat on the phone for a few minutes?  It can be in the evening or weekend or most anytime that is convenient for you.\n\nI hope your family is doing ok, oh by the way, just found out that you are also Catholic.

(AP) - In a milestone for student achievement and state pride, Mississippi has become the first state to have an online computer in each of its public-school classrooms, a spokesman for the governor said.\n\nThe state met the goal set by Gov. Ronnie Musgrove to connect Mississippi's 32,354 public classrooms to the Internet by Dec. 31, spokesman John Sewell said Wednesday.\n\nThe accomplishment has added importance in a state that has often found itself near the low end of educational and economic rankings.\n\n``I've never known Mississippi to lead the nation in any educational category or technological category,'' said Tom Pittman, publisher of The DeSoto Times in northern Mississippi. ``It puts us at the forefront of something that is \n\nsignificant and important.'' \n\nThe idea to hook up all the state's public classrooms to the Internet began in 1999 as a challenge offered up by Pittman's brother, then-America Online chief executive Bob Pittman, at a meeting of the Mississippi Economic \n\nCouncil. Musgrove, a candidate for governor at the time, made the challenge part of his campaign. \n\nThe job required $40 million worth of equipment and training, but federal funding, private donations and programs that trained students to build computers meant the project cost the state just $6 million, according to Musgrove's office. Donations included $500,000 from Mississippi native and former Netscape chief executive Jim Barksdale.\n\nBesides Mississippi, the state closest to filling classrooms with online computers is Delaware, according to the National Governors Association in Washington.\n\nNow that the computers are in place, the schools will have to train teachers to use them and pay for maintenance, upgrades and connections, Sewell said. Some of the costs can be eased with federal education programs and by \n\ntraining students to fix computers, he added. \n\n01/02/03 01:47 EST \n\n\n"

If there are no new boat docks, it does not mean there will be less boats.  It does mean that there will be more boats at already overcrowded boat ramps - a much greater risk to Manatees.\n\n2. If a dock moratorium is issued, it will not mean that no docks will be built.  It does mean that the honest dock builder will be out of work and illegal contractors will have a field day.  It needs to be noted that when mangroves were not allowed to be trimmed, the mangroves started to disappear \"overnight\".  This indicates that unrealistic methods of conservation have a tendency to backfire.\n\n3. There are three times the number of Manatees today than there were ten years ago.  And twenty years ago, it was a rarity to see a Manatee.  Why is this?  I believe because of boater awareness and concern.  No one wants to harm a Manatee.  I think it is a slap in the face from certain groups to insinuate that anyone would.\n\n4. The Save the Manatee Club (SMC) states that the Manatee is \"the best, most effective growth tool that exists.\" (Pat Rose, New York Times, Feb. 2002 - by Andy Revkin).  In Florida Sportsman, in February of 1994, he stated: \"People in Florida have to realize that you're going to have to put a lid on growth.  And if this animal is the vehicle to do that, then so be it!\"  What?  Is it the Manatee they are concerned about?   It sounds like a different agenda to me!\n\n5. In any of the lawsuits that these groups have instituted have the boaters' rights been considered?  Or the personal rights of the waterfront homeowner?  It does not look like it.  Is this legal?  Is this ethical?\n\n6. Economic impact: wide range.  There would be a huge impact on many industries (manufacturers, suppliers, builders, etc.), but more importantly, the people employed here would be devastated.  Bottom line: docks not being built will not in any way reduce the number of boats, but will affect many, many families in ways that are not reversible.  This is the ultimate \"no brainer\"!\n\nLet me give you an idea what it would do to myself and my family.  I have been a dock builder for most of my adult life.  At the age of 51, if my livelihood is yanked out from under me, it will be virtually impossible to find another job for which I would be qualified.  This would mean financial disaster for my family.  My older son, who is in this third year at the University of Florida would have to quit.  He is very bright and deserves the opportunity to complete his education.  My younger son is a senior in high school.  He wants to be a veterinarian.  Imagine that, the \"Save the Manatee\" so-called cause would keep him from reaching his dream of helping all animals.   We would lose our home, our way of life - the list goes on and on.  This is just one example of the ramifications of this ill advised proposal - there would be thousands of similar stories all across the marine industry - and all for a proposal which will not have the desired results of \"saving the Manatee\".  Is this possible in the democracy that we call the United States of America?  Let's hope not.\n\nThere is a logical, common sense solution to the problem of protecting the Manatee.  What needs to happen is simple.  We don't need to eliminate boat docks (has a dock ever jumped out and killed a Manatee???  I think not!!!)  Boaters need to be educated and there needs to be more law enforcement patrolling the waterways.  There are tens (maybe hundreds) of thousands of boats registered in the State of Florida - all of them renew their registration annually.  Add $5.00 to each registration renewal.  This will provide the necessary funding to educate boaters (why not require all boaters to take a safe boating course) and provide more officers on the waterways - and the funding would be renewable every year.  It seems so simple, it's hard to believe this alternative has not been suggested.  \n\nDoesn't this seem more reasonable?  The dock moratorium will result in loss of jobs, loss of tax base, loss of personal rights, (guaranteed by the US Constitution by the way), loss of property rights, etc.  The suggestion put forth above will put the responsibility on all boaters who will all help pay the way by the nominal addition to their vessel registration each year.\n\nPlease do what you can to stop the US FIsh and Wilelife Service from being irrational in their knee jerk reaction to a law suit filed by the Save the Manatee Club (and others) that was not based on scientific fact (Manatees are more plentiful than they've ever been).  Let's face it, all of us (boaters and not) would like to see the Manatees survive, and continue to thrive (which they are doing).  Let's be rational about how we accomplish this task.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nJOHN GREENE SHARON GREENE\n\n"

Now we know that you have no direct say in federal law, but we would like to know if you can put some pressure on your brother, and let him know how unhappy Veterans in your state are, as well as other states. Maybe you can talk with other Governors and get them to contact the President and help pressure him into keeping his promises and doing the right thing. So many Veterans from so many wars suffer because they don't get their retirement because it's taken away if they're disabled. To watch a Veteran loose his home because he is unable to work because of a service connected disability should never happen, and it wouldn't with Concurrent Receipt.\n>\n>\t\tIra \"Jake\" Jakob\n"

I simply want you to know that we approve of the Phonics Program because we are the typical target audience.  We have gone from non readers to volume readers, no the word is not voracious,  We read volumes of material now to reach automaticity. \n       Once we read : Mat, Sam, and  Gum on the Cat.  This was our own Phonics Program.  But now we can read.  \n       Last year we read STEP UP biographies Meet: Abraham Lincoln,  Benjamine Franklin,...and we read If You Were There When They Signed the Constitution,   We wondered why education became a state regulated right, because it varies so much from state to state. ( and district to district)\n        This year we read Maximum Boy:  Attack of the Soggy Underwater People.   (a series of 8 books, number 8 will be released in February and we could read it to you to demonstrate our prowess). Now we can read material we choose because phonics works and we can read.\n       We also read longer books like Harry Potter and the RedWall series.  For these we take another strategy,  since our early books had 1-4 sentences on a page we do that.  Will can read the beginning sentences and then I read the rest. This allows us to read adult vocabulary in which complex words can be decoded,  followed by a rest in which mom carries the plot.  \n       We also use another  technique in which Will listens only, this allows for vocabulary development.  (at 8 yrs he had the vocab of an 11 yr ) (It is not the only program nor is it the one we use the most, but Will has a high IQ and his mind demands more substance than his reading level provides. Here we may read Bulfinche's Mythology or a Wrinkle in Time.\n       There is only one other thing you need to know ,Will was declared Dyslexic at the end of First Grade, with a deficit in rapid naming, which is visual processing not with a hearing or auditory deficit.  In second grade his in class teacher used, as the primary teaching method, a method  called Model Reading in which she read to the class.  His beginning of the year reading score showed that he was reading on the second grade level, with our diagnosis he was given a special reading program, for hearing impairment, ending at the end of the year with a promotion to the third grade now reading at the first grade level.  We regressed !!!!!!!! now we had a  2 year deficit.       We appealed and were given a ruling of _NO CORRECTIVE ACTION NECESSARY.\n     We want you to know that we are out here and we have suffered in the hands of the school system, we were there before the new system arrived. Please don't sell the Phonics  Program short and provide a partial program which says we provided a program,  it doesnt matter if it works or not. \n       We can learn to read,  We have !!  We can learn to work hard, We have !!  We can help lead the way, some times we know a better way!!  We do.   Look at Charles Schwabb, Look at Will,  \n\n"

Although I don't totally agree with all of your politics, I do however respect and agree with your position on family, and the values thereof.  My problem is or should I say my confusion about the way family court is handled here in South Fl. leaves something to be desired Mr. Governor, to be brief, in 1987 I was introduced into the family courts division of Broward County, because of a case involving shared parental responsibility,and child support, now I do however agree that there are a lot of fathers out there whom don't give one thought about bringing children into this world and doing nothing to help raise, support, nuture, or provide for the upbringing of these children. I, on the other hand,had it all planned, to be there, help raise, support, and give my son whom the law says and allows that I have a God-given legal right to be involved in his life, without going into all the legal details and possibly boring you with have been in and out of court for the past 16 to 20 years for, just trying to have a relationship with my son whose name is Anthony!! at one point there seemed to be some relief based on the letter of the law, but somehow through all the legal wranglings and loopholes, I have been what our founding fathers have declared left out of the loop, meaning with the courts knowing that my son's mother left the state, and manipulated the welfare system for all these years, failed to uphold the law which I am entitled to,that is to make sure the best interest rule applied to myself as well as my son and his mother.  It was in the best interest of my son to have the loving affects of both his parents in his life and he was denied this because the law failed and failed miserably. After tryin to fight this back and forth for so long I did beg and appeal to the courts sense of what suppose to be fair play, but through no avail, now after all this time when I go into the court of clerks office to review my file, remember I did say it started in 1987, I was told that the file after a certain amount of time is destroyed, now I don't believe this and if the paper is to be thrown out then it should have been on mircofich film, which it is not, andf all that remains is a thin folder with none more than a few pages of much recent filings and rulings. my request to you Mr. Governor is with all you have to contend with in this state I respectfully asked that if it is all possible, and I don't see why it wouldn't be, barring stepping on any legal toes(maybe you need to) is you could appoint some watch dog group to oversee the system here in Broward County, because there is a lot wrong here sir, I have a grown son out there who dosen't know me maybe don't want to know me, living a lie for the past 20 years, but yet I am being persecuted even now because of a woman who used and lied her way through the system and intentionally kept her own son from knowing his father along with the blessings and support of the court system.  Because, if I am to live with for the rest of my life, having my parental rights stripped away from me and people inside the system allowing this to go on and totally ignore it and with all the other obvious cases that are going through the same thing no doubt, then how is it that the state is continuing to take money away from me, knowing my signatrue is on the birth certificate, and nothing inside or out side of the law ever pervented me from being a father to this young man except the court system here and the people who you are suppose to govern over this system, there is a miscarriage of justice here Mr. Governor, and if I could afford legal counsel to repersent me in this matter I wolud have done so long ago instead of having some lazy attorney do nothing but be buddy buddy with the opposing side and still allow this to happen. You are my governor, Sir, and as a citizen of the great state of Florida I am asking for your help, even though I did not vote for you, I do however respect and support your ability to run this state as you see fit for all the citizens not just a chosen few.  I eagerly await a positive response from you.\n\n \n\n                                                          Respectfully, J.W.Morgan\n\n\n\n\n  _____  \n\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!

        "body": "\n\nDear Governor Bush:\n\nIt was an honor and pleasure to attend your campaign stop at the\nAventura\nTurnberry Jewish Center yesterday along with Mayor Giuliani.  It was a\nvery\nnice presentation and one that I believe had a positive impact on a\ntraditionally Democratic population.  I was pleased to hear you mention\nthe\nissue of malpractice reform and surprised when you specifically\nmentioned\nour hospital's recent (and unfortunate) decision to close our OB service\ndue\nto the outrageous cost of malpractice insurance.  After your\npresentation\nyou asked about the total costs and revenue regarding this service.  I\ncan\nsend you lots on info, but in brief... We paid approximately $1,000 per\ndelivery to cover the cost of OB related malpractice insurance.  We\nreceive\nabout $2,500 - $3,000 per delivery in payments from insurance companies,\nHMOs, etc.  However, our total costs per delivery (including malpractice\ninsurance) is about $3,500 per delivery.  Therefore, in the 6+ years the\nprogram was open, we delivered about 850-900 babies per year, losing\nabout\n$500,000 -$750,000 each year.  During this time, we never ever had a\nlawsuit\nfiled against us for an OB related issue, but still our OB related\nmalpractice premium totaled about $1 million per year.  OB represents\nonly\nabout 2% of our total patient revenue, but accounted for 26% of our\ntotal\nmalpractice insurance costs.  Most hospital OB programs are not\nfinancially\nself supporting.  But the larger OB programs rely on the revenue\ngenerated\nby Level II and Level III Neonatal Intensive Care Units to offset the\nlosses\nincurred in the OB service.  Since we only have a Level I nursery, we\ndid\nnot have this option. Since the service was not a core service for us,\nwe\ndetermined we needed to focus our resources elsewhere to better serve\nour\ncommunity's needs.\n\nSometime after the election, I would like to write you about our need\nfor\napproval of our CON application for Cardiac Surgery services.  Due to\nour\ndemographics, what made OB a challenging service to provide, (an elderly\n/\ncardiac disease prone population) demand we provide Open Heart Surgery\nand\nAngioplasty services. But without State approval, we can't.   We see the\nsecond highest volume of non-surgical cardiology patients in Dade County\n(That's right! More than, Cedars, Jackson, Mercy, Baptist, Miami Heart,\nPalmetto, etc).. Only Mt Sinai sees more than us. We have about 80\ncardiologists and Cardiac / Thoracic surgeons on our staff, and we boast\nthe\nnewest State-Of -The Art Cardiac Cath Lab in the area.  Yet, we send out\nabout 350-400 patients each year for cardiac surgery and angioplasty\nservices which we could do here (based on or great equipment and\nphysicians)\nbut can't, due to lack of CON approval.  Many of these patients are\ncomprised and even jeopardized as a result of the inherent delays\ninvolved\nwith these transfers. We have a unique agreement with Mt Sinai in which\nthey\nwill close one of their two Cardiac Surgery programs when we get\napproval to\nopen one here at Aventura.  Yet our application was denied under AHCA\nSecretary Rubin King Shaw (even though the AHCA staff recommended\napproval)\nand is currently under appeal.  While still under appeal, we intend to\nfile\na second application in this current CON cycle.  Over the past year, I\nhave\nmet with AHCA Secretary Rhonda Medows, and she seems interested in and\nsympathetic to our needs and our unique agreement with Mt Sinai which\neffectively places a new Cardiac Surgery program in an area of great\npatient\nneed without adding a program to our Health Planning District.\nBasically we\nwill be locating a program from an area of excess resources to an area\nof\nneed and without the local resource.  We had over 14,000 signatures and\n360\nletters of support form our local community for this program and perhaps\nwith your help we may someday be able to offer this service in our local\ncommunity.  If you have an interest in reviewing this issue and helping\nus\nbring this needed service to our community, I would be happy to provide\nyou\nwith more information or perhaps meet with you and Secretary Medows to\ndiscuss it further.  \n\nAgain, it was a pleasure to see you here in Aventura.  Good Luck on\nTuesday\nNovember 5th... I am confident you will be celebrating another victory!\nThanks,\nDavide M.

RE:  COMMENTS TO DRAFT REPORT OF INQUIRY STATE COMPLAINT AGAINST MIAMI-DADE COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLS ON BEHALF OF C.I.

This Draft Report of Inquiry and cover-up is a perfect example of \"what's wrong with the system?\" and the reason why more and more parents each day are choosing to participate in the McKay Scholarship Program!  This is the only way that parents of children with disabilities can exercise their dissatisfaction with this broken system in Florida, and we have to count our blessings.  A system that for decades has failed to provide FAPE in the least restrictive environment to those it has been funded to serve, and, instead of \"serving\" the children, it makes victims of them and of their families.  A system that for decades has failed to be accountable for the immense waste of human potential!  \n\nLilliam Rangel-Diaz\nCenter For Education Advocacy <http://members.aol.com/lillyrdiaz/>  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In the event that this occurs, this will open the door for a new qualified, positive role model to take charge as Sheriff of this County.

I watched Mr. Parker rise from the ranks to hold the position of Chief Administrator with the rank of Major for the Brevard County Sheriff's Office. Mr. Parker held that position till his departure to assume his current position as Director of Public Safety.  Mr. Parker is a strong, positive, qualified and intelligent  leader that would be an asset to the people of Brevard County as well as the employees of the Sheriff's Office.\n\nI, for one, urge you to appoint Jack Parker as the next Sheriff of Brevard County.

        "body": "\n\nHi-\nThere is an education consultant that really inspires me.  I've finally accomplished getting my committee to hear him and they are very excited.  I sent you a few of his thoughts on education a few months ago. Dr. Porter will be speaking to us, hopefully within the next two weeks.  He would like to meet with you and I really feel that you would enjoy talking with him and hearing his ideas.  One of the many things he advises on is Career Academies. I really like his model and his ideas.  If you would be interested in meeting with him, I would love to arrange that.  I really think he has some proven ideas that could really contribute to many of your educational goals, including basic academics, reading etc. \n\nThe following is some basic outline information he sent to me:\n\n1) Benchmark the best. Take key stakeholders to Denmark and Scotland \nvia my example (7 days Sunday thru Sunday). Get people excited flying \nback with a 'draft' vision of what a new 'system' could look-like \n(not more than 25 people at one time or two groups of 15--one group \nstudies Denmark the other Scotland and then bring them together on \nthe Saturday before they leave with a common vision); \n\n2) Focus on the end (first). Develop a vision of a new Florida high \nschool graduate and what s/he would look like (not a list of \ngraduation requirements-but a real rite-of-passage profile of a 'high \nskilled' young adult. I'll send you an example of what I mean that I \nrecently helped the State of Hawaii develop). This will get \neveryone's attention quickly; \n\n3) Change high schools. Start a major state-wide initiative on career \nacademies via the California model (e.g.,tight design criteria, \nplanning funds for one year, a 'director-level' position leading the \ninitiative, major business and industry support, etc.). The former \nCalifornia director, Susan Tidyman, is now a national consultant \nworking out of University of California and can help the Florida \nEducation Department get this off the ground; and \n\n4) Create Pipleline Programs. Feeding into the new Florida Career \nAcademies will be a series of literacy, math and science acceleration \n'Saturday Academies' for student grades 4-8 (co-sponsored by NASA). \nAllow each school district to start them only after they have \nsuccessfully implemented their State 'endorsed' career academy (the \nSaturday Academies run each Saturday except for holidays and two \nweeks during the summer on a nearby college/university campus. The \nare designed for at-risk students that are two or more grade levels \nbehind in reading and/or math. The 'state director' for career \nacademies should also also responsible for the Saturday Academies). \n\nIf you started just these four things systemically, Florida public \neducation would never be the same again. You'll be doing several \nthings at the same time that some researchers have been advocating \nfor years: 1) create a new vision of what's possible; 2) redefine the \nend, now, for everyone; 3) implement a proven design that works \nquickly that supports the new vision (so people can link best \npractice designs to a new belief system). \n\nSee what you've done--you have me rambling on now. I'll be glad to \nhelp you and the council anyway I can. I would love to meet the \nGovernor whenever possible. Maybe on the same trip that will be \nplanned for the whole council? Let me know.\n\nThis excerpt doesn't give you a full picture of Dr. Porter.  I know your time is so very valuable and I will understand if you don't have the time to meet with Dr. Porter.  I have a feeling you would find that he has great insight and proven models. He is very dedicated to education success. He beleives when we draw organizational charts, the student should be at the top of that chart.\n\nSorry for the long e-mail.\n\nHave a good evening.\nDiane\n\n--\nDiane Leone\nMarketing Edge, Inc. \nemail - info@marketingedgeonline.com\nhttp://www.marketingedgeonline.com\n904.823.1998\nMarketing Edge: The Synergy of Marketing, Promotions and Environments\n--\n"

I am also the co-founder of a grassroots, not-for-profit organization called Noah's Ark of Central Florida.  Our mission statement reads: \n\n\"Noah's Ark is committed to empowering individuals who have developmental disabilities by advocating on their behalf and by providing or facilitating meaningful employment, recreational and social opportunities and affordable housing choices\".\n\nToday, I received an e-mail from another parent organization referencing SB178 which proposes to ammend FS 419 (which, in part, related to the proximity of licensed group homes to other single family homes).  After reading the proposed changes, I am in shock and disbelief.  \n\nThe proposed language requiring a group home be located a minimum of 500'  from an existing home is unrealistic.  This would mean that all future group homes be located in rural locations which creates another wave of challenges for this fragile population (transportation, support services, access to employment, community inclusion, shopping, etc.).  I would like the opportunity to talk (or meet) with you so that I may try and understand the spirit and purpose of your proposed ammendment.  I do not see any upside in your proposal for individuals with disabilities.\n\nI would also like the opportunity to help you better understand the unique needs of individuals with developmental disabilities and the incredible demands that face their families on a day-to-day basis.  \n\nIn the past four years, Governor Bush has demonstrated extraordinary leadership in trying to meet the basic needs of individuals with developmental disabilities.  The legislature has increased funding for Developmental Disabilities dramatically but there is still a \"waiting list\" of over 10,000 individuals who are not being served (including my daughter).\n\nIf SB 178 is adopted, it would have a devastating effect of the future of thousands of individuals with disabilities and their families.\n\nWhen can we talk?  I can be reached, day or night, at (863) 816-7499.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nJack Kosik\nBrittany's Dad &\nCo-Founder of Noah's Ark of Central Florida\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It has come to my attention that our present Sheriff Phil Williams may be moving on to a Judge ship in the 18th Judicial Circuit. I am glad to see the man move up, however what does concern me is his replacement. I have been a Deputy Sheriff in Brevard County now for seventeen years. In that seventeen years it has been an honor and a pleasure to work for and with Mr. Jack Parker (Director of Public Safety) for Brevard County. Mr. Parker, I have personally known for over 15 years and in that time I have gotten to know him and the kind of man he is. He is a great family man and a hard worker from day one. He rose though the ranks in the Sheriffs Department and was one of the youngest person on the department to become a Major and Administrator. As an Administrator Mr. Parker took the job and ran with it. He did this until becoming the Counties Public Safety Director. Mr. Parker is a strong leader, he has positive qualities and the kind of integrity and intelligent it takes to Be our next Sheriff in Brevard County. Please know as a senior Deputy Sheriff with the Brevard County Sheriffs Office Mr. Parker has my total loyalty and respect and I would be proud to work for him.\n \nThank you for your time\n \nDeputy Sheriff Stephen Reeves\n"

I know the Bush family cares what is best for our country and its citizens. I am asking you to consider Jack Parker to the position of sheriff. He is well liked by his peers ( I personally know many deputies), and they also would like to see Jack Parker appointed. For us in Brevard County, it is very important who you appoint. It is a decision that we have to live with. Jack parker is a fair, well experienced sheriff, with many years serving directly under our last sheriff, Sheriff Miller. There is no one who can better serve this office in the county than Jack Parker.

I am a ryhme master at your service. \n\nAn Introduction to Dr. San Man\n\nHe is referred to as Dr. San Man, with words that heal the soul, as he has reached out grasping the experiences of life as though it were a voluptuous fruit, savoring it's tasty nectar translating it into spoken word. The Ambassador Poet and Tampa Icon noted for his charisma, his smile and his entertaining nature is available for your hospitality needs. Dr. San Man was raised in Japan son of a Colonel in the United States Army, which allowed him to travel extensively throughout the U.S. and Far East Asia. Dr. San Man has also visited Morocco, in Northern Africa were he enjoyed digesting the diversity of how other cultures live, worship, work and play adding insight to the inspiration of spoken word. Dr. San Man began writing poetry at age 11 in Pusan, Korea when he was confronted with the fact that the world did not live as well as he'd been lead to believe.\n\nDr. San Man attended eight High Schools in five different states finally to settle down in Tampa Florida in 1982. He is a graduate of Hillsborough Community College in Justice Administration to attend The University of South Florida were he studied Political Science, Philosophy, Religion receiving a graduate scholarship opportunity in Correction Special Education. Upon becoming bitterly disappointed in how formal education is an instrument used to conform society and not to elevate the thinking of the people, \"people with Ph.D.'s run the world and just witness the destruction they have uncovered: a piece of paper with a dead person on it means more than the living who suffer at the hands of the economy.\"\n\nDr. San Man has maintained a diary of poetry for over thirty years with topics that entail politics, religion, racism, equality, romance, poverty, ignorance and life in general. He has fought for human rights locally and on the state and national level causing him to run for public office, to initiate several youth organizations and writing grants to accomplish the goals he has set forth. Dr. San Man recently began touring the United States delighting his audiences that will soon extend to Africa and Ireland reciting poetry and spoken word from his published book, \"A Poetic Buffet to Reality\", Volume I, She Is The Key. These poems illustrate the majesty and strength of the woman as a reflection of the man. Dr. San Man's works are available in a unique form of recording on CD and cassette: we have T-shirts, bumper stickers and a line of San Wear. Dr. San Man can be viewed weekly @ noon on www.hawkradio.com. It is the desire of Dr. San Man to share peace and love with all he comes in contact with through his poetry and short stories.

In the event that should happen, I would like to recommend Jack Parker, Brevard County Director of Public Safety, to fill the position of sheriff.\n            I have known Jack professionally and personally for ten years. I first met him in 1993 when I was serving as Warden (now retired) at Brevard Correctional Institution, and Jack was a Major in the Sheriff's Department Merritt Island Precinct. At that time he was also a volunteer at Crosswinds Youth Services,  a junvenile delinquency prevention and reduction program in Brevard County and was President of the Board of Directors. I was also elected to serve on the board and had first hand opportunity to see Jack function in a leadership role. He did a truly outstanding job. He was later promoted to the sheriff's department Business Manager, and served there until the current sheriff was elected in 1996. The new sheriff kept Jack on and appointed him to run the county jail operation, which again brought us in close contact. Jack did an outstanding job there as well until he was appointed to his current position as Brevard's Director of Public Safety.  Additionally, after a brief hiatus for family reasons, he continues to serve as a volunteer on Crosswinds Board of Directors.       \n           He is state certified in Law Enforcement, Corrections,and Fire Safety. He is well experienced, knowledgeble, and has excellent communication skills. He is a dedicated husband, father, and community leader. In all my interactions with Jack over the years, I have always found him to be honest, reliable, trustworthy, and productive. \n            It is truly an honor and pleasure to recommend him to you should the Brevard Sheriff's position become available for appointment.\n \n \nRespectfully Submitted,\nDave Hemme,  Warden (Retired)\nFlorida Department of Corrections\n"

        "body": "\n\nGreetings Governor Bush,\n \nI read with interest in the Florida Today newspaper this morning that the Sheriff of Brevard County is considering applying for an open Circuit Court Judgeship in the 18th Circuit. Should this actually occur, I would like to make a personal recommendation for his replacement.\n \nThe current Director of Public Safety for Brevard County, Jack Parker, would make an outstanding Sheriff. Before moving over to his current position, he was a career law enforcement officer in this county. I came to know Jack in January of 1987 when I gained employment with the Sheriff's office. I started as a line officer in the Brevard County Detention Center, and Jack was my immediate supervisor. He guided my career with the skills of a mentor, exhibiting true concerns for not only my learning curve, but my personal safety as well. He genuinely cared for the Officers that reported to him, and constantly strived to make the work environment one that you looked forward to every day. He is an effective communicator that possesses an excellent sense of humor. His people skills serve him well, as I've witnessed his expertise in defusing critical incident situations, making it appear seemingly effortless.\n \nWhen Jack was promoted to a management position with the Sheriff and left the Detention Center, a collective gasp was heard throughout the ranks. While we all missed his presence, we were very grateful for the time he guided us, and knew that he would continue to do well. Jack rose through the ranks of the Sheriff's Department, and eventually was entrusted with operating the Detention Center. I've not seen a more devoted, loyal, and dedicated officer. \n \nIt's obvious to me that there is a very valuable and capable resource to be considered should the Office of the Sheriff become vacant. A person of very high integrity, that actually came through the ranks of the department, is knowledgeable of most all operations and support aspects, and most importantly, looked up to and respected by all who know him.\n \nI severed service with the Sheriff's Office in 1999, but will be forever grateful for the experience of having served with pride. It is my sincere hope that you would seriously consider Jack Parker for the Office of the Sheriff for Brevard County if you are asked to make the selection. He is the right choice to keep the pride alive.\n \nThank you for any consideration in this matter. \n \nJP Pauken\nResident of Brevard County, Florida, and former Sheriff's Office employee.\n \n"

Jack is an experienced leader who knows how to get the job done.  Having been a former Police Chief in Kentucky, I have an idea of what Jack will be facing should he receive this appointment.

Irene is a life long resident of Tampa and is deeply entrenched into the local business and political environment.\n \n2. Irene is a \"self made\" person of substance having created a career at Verizon since she started working part-time when she was in high school. No \"silver spoon\" for her!\n \n3. Irene had always been a tireless supporter of the Republican Party, both as a private citizen and as the head of the former GTE political PAC.\n \n4. Irene has the proven technical and management background to ensure that this office can become the State's finest example of how to blend the use of modern technology with \"good old fashion\" people handling skills in order to create an efficient Supervisor of Elections Office. Her background includes the day to day managemnt of hundreds of telecommunication workers functioning in today's complicated emerging world of technology. No one else mentioned in our local papers comes close to her management background. This background would justify her appointment regardless of her political party affiliation!\n \n5. Irene's current position at Verizon has also effectively prepared her to understand the importance of the blending of telecommunications, technology, and reading skills into a systematic campaign to successfully develop the young future voters of our county. I have no doubt that her ideas on how to use this office to increase the reading skills and the understanding of the values of our most cherished right..the right to vote...will become a national example for all!\n \nSeldom does a governor have a decision that is such a \"sure fire\" opportunity for immediate success!\n \nI thank you for your consideration!\n \nCharlie Guy\nPresident\nBrightZone, K20 Education Division\nEdulink, Inc.\n10515 Memorial Highway\nTampa, FL 33615\n \n813-818-8852 Office\n813-818-8892 Fax\n813-390-2299 Cell\n \ncguy@brightzone.net\nwww.edu-link.com <http://www.edu-link.com/> \n \n"

        "body": "\n\nGovernor\n\nPROPOSAL:  It is proposed the the State of Florida Create a Florida State Naval Militia, under the Control of the Governor and sponsored by, and under the auspices of, the National Guard Bureau, U.S. Department of Defense. The Florida State Naval Militia would be under the direct command of the Adjutant General of the Florida National Guard who is appointed by the Governor and Reports to the Governor. A Florida State Naval Militia would be a cost effective, highly visible organization that would enhance Homeland Security in our State with it's extensive coastline and numerous important Harbors, Ports  and Rivers and would give both the citizens of the State and anyone wishing to harm the State a visible, viable Naval presence that would otherwise not be available and would enhance the already valuable efforts of the U. S. Coast Guard.  A Florida State Naval Militia would be readily available for The Governor to use during either a State, or Natural Emergency \n\nBACKGROUND: Other States in the United States have had and continue to have State Naval Militias under the direct Command of their State Adjutants General, notably; New York and New Jersey. The U. S. Navy  started as a Naval Militia early during the Revolution. The Naval Militia would use readily available Naval and/or Armed Forces Reserve Training Centers and National Guard Centers and might possibly be able to use Active Military Installations for their training facilities; therefore, no new facilities would be needed. Historically, the various Training Facilities have had no difficulty in providing adequate space and support to Naval Militia units. In fact, many of the Naval Reservists already training at the aforementioned facilities would form the bulk of and/or the nucleus for the State Naval Militia units. Additionally, Coast Guard Reservists other Armed Forces Reservists, with some kind of maritime background; i.e; Army Transport and Engineering Specialists, Active or inactive Merchant Marine personnel, Veterans, Navy Fleet Reserve members, Naval ROTC (University) and Junior NROTC (High School), Coast Guard Auxiliary, Port and Harbor workers. i.e; Tugboat crews. as well as civilian volunteers would be the additional resources to man the Florida State Naval Militia Units. The U. S. Navy would be requested to supply any available surplus vessels to the Florida State Naval Militia. It is envisioned that the surplus vessels requested would be, diesel powered, medium or small sized tugs or harbor craft, medium or small sized landing craft, small minesweepers and possibly riverine warfare craft, gun boats, or other types of vessels to would be compatible with the Florida State Naval Militia Mission Statement. Landing craft could be outfitted with emergency diesel generators and fuel bladders that could be deployed in the event of a disaster to provide emergency electrical power to hospital or other emergency facilities.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: The Governor and the Legislation enact enabling legislation to establish a Florida State Naval Militia coordinating said establishment with the U. S. Department of Defense, National Guard Bureau and establish at least ten Florida State Naval Militia Units to be located in or near large population areas and at locations having immediate access to either a major port or river. It is further recommended that any vessels obtained from the U. S. Navy be limited to easily maintainable, diesel powered, uncomplicated electronic suites, weapons no larger than a 20 mm cannon and that the vessels need not be manpower intensive. Landing craft are ideal as they can easily and safely navigate our rivers, bays, offshore islands, and be readily available for many different emergency uses.\n\nNOTATION:\nThe undersigned is a Retired U. S. Navy Senior Officer, a Commander, with 22 years of Active Duty, Commanding Officer of a Destroyer in the Pacific Fleet during the Vietnam War, Decorated for Heroism, and had a subspecialty in the Training and Administration of the Naval Reserve who had personal experience with both the New York and New Jersey State Naval Militias during a three year tour of duty while stationed on the Staff of the Commandant third Naval District. The undersigned stands ready, willing and able to consult with, advise, expedite or help in any way desired to enable this proposal to come to fruition\n\nWeston L. Stow, Commander, U. S. Navy (Retired)\n\n\n\n\n"

The Children's Services Council also provides funds to the School Readiness Coalition of Palm Beach County-that is one of several local agencies I have worked with directly; in fact, it was a client of mine last year for ad hoc public relations services.  The School Readiness Coalition is implementing a number of new laws you enacted with the Legislature's passage.  In fact, nearly every single one of the new provisions calls for across-the-board changes.  These changes-as I witnessed directly-are forcing very intense negotiations of a complex fiscal nature.  The transfer, tweaking, or improving of multi-million dollar budget items for child care subsidies and child development requires a keen, careful, conservative eye experienced in fiscal work.\n\n \n\nWe need someone like Ron Harbison on that Council, which already has plenty of education, child care, and care provider representation...it needs more representation along fiscal management lines.  Ron is a former partner in a CPA firm and worked at Coopers & Lybrand.  He is now a principal in a successful local firm doing high-level mergers and acquisitions and other business growth services.  He's even a former IRS agent!  I hope you will appoint Ron Harbison-he has several children and is very well-known here in the business community, which will appreciate his perspective on the Council.

In the event that Sheriff Williams is appointed to this Judiciary position, I respectfully recommend that you appoint J. R. (Jack) Parker as the Interim Sheriff for Brevard County. \n\nI am currently enjoying my seventeenth year in law enforcement, and have had the personal and professional pleasure to call Jack Parker a true friend over the past eighteen years. As you are well aware, Jack is an outstanding representative of Brevard County. Jack has an impressive background in law enforcement with distinguished service as a Command Staff member for both former Sheriff C. W.

We have just heard from your scheduling office\nthat none of the proposed February dates for you to again serve as guest\nspeaker at our Committee of 100 Annual Dinner will work, but look forward to\nhaving you join us in Tampa again soon to celebrate our diversified economic\nbase that you have helped to build and sustain.\n\nOn a separate issue, I wanted to make you aware of very recent developments\nas a follow up to my previous correspondence regarding the significant\npotential \"window of opportunity\" that the Fed's Draft White Paper provides\nto Florida. We have been informed by several corporate site selection\nconsultants that Florida's inducement/incentive programs are not being\nviewed as competitive when compared to other southeastern states, and in\nfact, a sizeable gap exists.  The source of contention is the availability\nof job development tax credits that are funded through a withholding of that\nstate's personal income tax for its employees, and which can be used for\nland, building, utilities, training, employee relocation and other upfront\nstart-up costs.  Since Florida doesn't have that personal income tax revenue\nstream available to fund such a program, our position is viewed as\nuncompetitive - from a corporate standpoint.  \n\nWe realize that there are tremendous budget pressures confronting you and\nthe Legislature.  But we believe that two potential solutions could exist\nand might be worthy of further discussion to help close the perceived gap:\na) funding the already-approved \"Closing Fund\", which would allow companies\nimmediate assistance in offsetting the initial costs of relocating their\nsenior and mid-level managers, and b) making all current QTI target industry\nclusters eligible for the Capital Investment Tax Credit against their\nFlorida Corporate Profits Tax.  This would then extend the application to a\npotential major financial service company project's entire capital\nexpenditures, not just that portion allocated to Information Technology.\nSuch an extension of the CITC would seem to be revenue neutral for this\nfiscal year, while providing a much needed economic development \"tool\" to\nsecure major corporate facility expansions and relocations. \n\nAny guidance and direction that you would have on this issue would be much\nappreciated.\n\nKindest regards,\n\nRobin\n\n\n\n    \n\n -----Original Message-----\n"

I came back to work within six months and I have been \nliving on my own and working for the past 6 months.\n\nI am writing to let you know that I have found a medical procedure in \nChina that shows some promise to paraplegics in helping to regain the \nability to walk. Through research I came across a doctor in Shanghai, \nChina that does Nerve Rerouting. There are only two doctors who perform \nthis surgery, and Dr. Shaocheng has done over 100 of these surgeries. In \nhis latest case study on 23 paraplegics that under went this surgery 18 \n(78%) of them are walking.\n\n I will be leaving Saturday Jan.11th, and my surgery will be on Jan. \n15th. I thought you might want to know about one of your fellow state \ncitizens.  I and my family have been very supportive of your family and \nyou in the elections the past few years. In fact my first time I was \neligible to vote I voted for your father (for president). I will return \nin February and begin my rehab. Something you might want to know is the \nfact that I have gotten very little support from my HMO (Blue Cross), in \nfact they will not even help me when I return for my Rehab.\n\nThere is an article in the Tampa Tribune Jan. 9th (Pasco Section) about \nme going to China.

There were legal entanglements and finally\nyesterday, Wednesday, January 8, we were able to have a funeral and burial.\nJudaism usually moves much faster.  Inmates from a nearby prison had dug the\ngrave, some hospital staff came to the service, the paid chaplains were\nwonderful and appreciative, and I ensured that the Jewish patient received a\nJewish funeral.  It was a sad situation, but I felt that I made it just a\nlittle bit brighter.  The hospital director was not able to be there, but I\nhad met her before.  I believe that she is Ms. Diane James.

The largest number of deaths took place in Brevard and Lee counties, the scenes of disputes over restrictions on boating and dock-building.\n\nDavid Arnold, the state's chief of protected species management, blamed irresponsible boaters and bad luck for the deaths. He said the state would investigate why watercraft-related deaths increased sharply in certain areas, such as Palm Beach County, where the number of manatees killed by watercraft jumped from three in 2001 to six last year. Three were killed by watercraft in Broward County, down from four the year before.\n\nArnold said the number of manatees killed by watercraft may come down next year, because the state and federal governments have created restricted-boating areas. In Brevard, where watercraft killed 17 manatees last year, a new manatee-protection zone just went into effect.\n\n\"I would like to think that what we're doing will make a difference,\" he said.\n\nThe report found that the number of deaths overall declined from 325 in 2001 to 305 last year. But the increase in deaths from watercrafts is certain to be invoked in the fights swirling around the manatee.\n\nFederal wildlife officials are trying to restrict the construction of docks and marinas in southwest Florida to protect manatees, a move that Gov. Jeb Bush said would have a disastrous economic effect. Environmental groups have sued to force the state and federal governments to designate more slow-speed zones for manatees. And on Jan. 23, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is to vote whether to downgrade the manatee's status from endangered to threatened.\n\n\"We certainly think that the manatee needs all the protection it can get,\" said Judith Vallee, executive director of the Save the Manatee Club. \"This is no time to even consider downlisting, when we're losing so many manatees, not only to boat collisions, but there are so many manatees dying in Florida waters from all causes.\"\n\nTed Forsgren, executive director of the Coastal Conservation Association of Florida, a fishing group that opposes increased manatee protection, cautioned against drawing the wrong conclusion from a single statistic. All the evidence shows that the manatee population has grown over the past 45 years, and the number of deaths from collision is more evidence that the animals are widespread, he said.\n\n\"I honestly believe that the number of watercraft deaths is going to go down only if the number of animals declines,\" he said.\n\nThe latest aerial counts found more than 3,200 manatees in state waters, a record. Collisions with watercraft accounted for the largest number of deaths, followed by deaths by natural causes, the deaths of baby manatees and deaths from cold.\n\nDavid Fleshler can be reached at dfleshler\\@sun-sentinel.com or 954-356-4535. \n\nCopyright (c) 2003, South Florida Sun-Sentinel \n\nVisit Sun-Sentinel.com\n"

For this I thank him.\n\n It is further understood that if Sheriff Williams is appointed, Jack Parker, Director of Brevard County Public Safety, is one of your considerations for the internship as Sheriff. I have personally know Director Parker for many years , as a member of the Brevard County Sheriff\u2019s office and through his work as Director of  Brevard County Public Safety. Director Parker is well liked and respected throughout the county. His leadership ability is \u201cSecond to None\u201d. Director Parker is a person I look up to and yet speak to as a friend. \n\n I feel, if appointed as Sheriff, Director Parker will serve you, the employees of the Brevard County Sheriff\u2019s Office and most importantly the citizens of Brevard County Sheriff with the highest of standards.\n\n In closing I would like to congratulate you on your re-election as our Governor of Florida. \n\n Thank you,  Randolph J.

        "body": "Cc: jack@brevardcounty.com\n\n\nGovernor Bush,\n\nMy name is Bill Farmer and I am the Fire Chief for Brevard County.  But, I am writing to you today as an individual.  I state my position so you may understand why I know what kind of an impact Jack Parker can have on an organization.\n\nIn the local section of the Today paper there was an article indicating that Sheriff Phil Williams may be seeking an appointment to a judgeship.  Should you choose to appoint the Honorable Sheriff to this position I believe you would be given another opportunity, the appointment of a new Sheriff.\n\nIn your enviable position of not having to consider re-election you only need to consider your legacy; and for Brevard County that may well mean the selection of our next Sheriff.  I cannot think of any other singular local elected official who has a greater impact to a community.  For this reason you will want to select a person who is community based, well educated, well respected by both civil and uniformed personnel, has managed a multi-million dollar public sector budget, and it wouldn't be a bad thing if he was a good republican too.\n\nJack Parker is that person.  \n\nI have worked with him for over five (5) years now:\n\nIMPROVING THE AGENCY:\n\nDuring those five (5) years under his partnership, mentoring and guidance Brevard County Fire Rescue has enhanced its medical capabilities ensuring that every citizen living in unincorporated Brevard County has access to Advanced Life Support.  The agency has a response time to emergencies five (5) minutes faster than the nationally recommended response time and has equipment (and more importantly a continuing plan) which is modern and yet cost efficient.\n\nHe spearheaded the expansion of our Emergency Medical Services (EMS) system into central Brevard County.  In essence he was responsible for the management of the expansion of an agency answering approximately 24,000, 911 EMS calls with ten (10) ambulances to an agency answering 40,000+, 911 EMS calls with twenty-three (23) ambulances.\n\nPERSONNEL:\n\nEmployee participation in the managing of the agency has also been increased.  Employees routinely provide committee input to the equipment they utilize and the stations they live in.  Yet, accountability has also been increased.\n\n\nHe led the agency into creating an Employee Awards program, recognizing those employees who do the job well, who go the extra mile, and who pull the community together.\n\nEMERGENCY EXPERIENCE:\n\nDuring his tenure with Brevard County Fire Rescue he has been the Public Safety Director during the worse natural disaster to strike Brevard County, the 1998 Fire Storm.  During this event Mr. Parker interacted with both local, state and federal officials ensuring that the citizens of Brevard County had a county official who was accountable.  Because of his leadership more than 800 homes were saved that would have been lost.\n\nFurther, because of his interaction with state officials, keeping the State Fire Marshal's office and the Governor's office informed of the conditions of the fire storm, Mr. Parker was instrumental in bringing specialized firefighting equipment to the line firefighters.\n\nAdditionally, he has Emergency Management/Emergency Operations Center (EOC) experience dealing with hurricanes, tornados and other natural, man-made and terrorist disasters.  Mr. Parker knows how Brevard County's Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan works.  He can function as the Sheriff in the EOC's Policy group the day after you appoint him should Brevard County be struck by a natural, man-made or terrorist disaster.  There is no lead time, and he knows all the players.  \n\nAs a certified law enforcement officer and a state certified firefighter he can interact across all of the \"empires\".  He is well known and respected by both the law enforcement and firefighting communities within Brevard.\n\nPlease consider the above.  In short, the firefighters respect him, the cops respect him.  He has worked as a Deputy, as a Corrections Officer and Sheriff Commander in Brevard.  He has command experience both on the law enforcement and fire sides of the house.  He has managed a public sector 40+ million dollar budget.  He has recognized community needs and addressed them.  Your opportunity to ensure that Brevard County is safe during these insecure times is now.  \n\nGovernor Bush, the choice is obviously yours.  Jack Parker is the man to be Sheriff and he'll be a credit to your legacy.\n\nPlease feel free to e-mail me if I can answer any questions or be of any assistance.\n\nBill Farmer\n\n321-633-6597 home \n\n"

My employment with the Brevard County is important in understanding the basis of the opinion I would like to convey to you.\n\nGiven the statement of Sheriff Phil Willliams in a local newspaper today, it appears you may have an opportunity to appoint someone to the position of the Brevard County Sheriff should you appoint Sheriff Williams to the position of Circuit Judge.  \n\nJack Parker is the person you should appoint to the position of Brevard County Sheriff should the opportunity arise.  I have known and worked with Jack for over 15 years...working with him on many legal issues - from the time he worked under Sheriff Jake Miller as an Assistant Commander at the jail, later as a Commander with the Sheriffs Office,  up until now as the Director of the Public Safety Department for Brevard County.   \n\nHe has the respect of the law enforcement community and of the Board of County Commissioners.  He has knowledge of the Sheriff's Department, of the challenges it faces, of the budgetary issues,  of management and organizational skills which are badly needed in such organizations.\n\nI do not think you could find an individual more dedicated to the welfare of this County or to the welfare of the Sheriff's Office as an organization.  Nor could you find anyone who would work harder or more diligently to ensure he was a credit to you and deserving of the trust you placed in him by such an appointment.\n\nI could go on for much longer, but I won't.  You have many other issues to consider and Emails.  I would be happy to answer any questions.\n\nIn sum, quite simply, Jack Parker is the right person for the job.  \n\n\n\n"

We're way ahead of most states with our testing and accountability program.\nThe tricky part is the requirement that we hold schools accountable for the performance of subgroups defined by race and ethnicity. The feds want us to look and see how Hispanic kids and African American kids at each school performed and hold the schools' collective feet to the fire if those kids are lagging behind. \nThat's a little different from our system. Though we look at the performance of the lowest quartile, and we publicize disaggregated data, we have a color-blind accountability system.\nDOE tells me we have no plans to do any serious tinkering with our current accountability system, but that we might overlay the federal system so we can comply. I guess that means it will be possible for a school to avoid an F from the state, but still be failing in the eyes of the feds. Won't that be confusing?\nShould Florida introduce race as a factor in its school accountability system? Are we willing to change our accountability system - again? Or can we have a sort of a two-tiered system without confusing parents?\nJust wondering.\nI'm working to get John Winn on the phone. So far it has been easier to get Rod Paige on the phone. (He says Florida is just great, but that Texas is better. Go figure.)\nSteve H\n\n"

        "body": "\n\nDear Governor Bush,\nI am writing to request that you and your staff consider a way to compensate primary (K-2) schools under the A+ Plan.  \n \nSince Holley-Navarre Primary School opened in 1994, there has been great emphasis placed on high achievement.  Since the A+ program began, the intermediate school has been capitalizing on the excellent foundation we lay for the children that take the FCAT.  They have been rewarded every year that the program has existed.  We have been their only feeder school the entire time. \n \nWe have recently become aware that our district does not qualify for extra funding for \u201cNo Child Left Behind\u201d because we are above the criteria set.  Our school does not receive any Title I funding because our percentage of free/reduced lunch children is near 30%.  We have difficulty earning grants because it is difficult to demonstrate a need.  We are concerned that we may begin to lag behind other schools because we do not have access to the same resources the other schools have.  Our school is the ideal that the A+ School Plan is attempting to reach, but it takes capital to maintain.  Our School Advisory Council is well aware of this, and is looking for ways to maintain, and preferably improve our standing.\n \nA fair solution would seem to be that for the purposes of allocating A+ money that we were considered to be a part of the intermediate school.  Since K-5 schools receive the reward based upon FCAT scores and other criteria, it would seem that funding for our K-2 could be based on the intermediate\u2019s 3-5 FCAT scores, as long as we met the other criteria.  As I mentioned above, we are the only feeder school. \n \nThe current plan seems to discourage the primary-intermediate school model.  Although we have been offered the option of becoming a K-5 school, our School Advisory Council, our parents, and our staff do not favor it.  We believe we have optimal conditions for preparing children for the next level.  Any benefits we would receive from A+ money would be offset by the problems we would inherit.  \n \nFinally, you are invited to visit our school, and hear from our School Advisory Council.  We believe you will see the high quality program we offer, and the need to remain \u201ccutting edge\u201d.  Thank you for your consideration of this matter that is very important to all of us.\n \nRick Hardcastle\nAssistant Principal\nHolley-Navarre Primary School\n1955 Lowe Road\nNavarre, FL 32566\n(850) 936-6000 \n"

It is through \"sex education\" that many controversial and potentially detrimental issues are introduced to students in the name of diversity, sensitivity, safety, etc.  \n \nThe time is right to get the state of Florida out of the \"sex education\" business.  It is the parents' job!  I understand the Florida Education Legislation says that abstinence is to be taught as the preferred behavior until marriage and that marriage consists of a relationship between one woman and one man.  However, this is not what is truly being taught.\n \nPlease consider proposing the removal of \"sex education\" curriculum as one means of reducing costs and avoiding potentially huge legal liability since Florida is needing to cut costs and liabilities in an effort to enact the class size reduction amendment.\n \nAs you may remember I ran for a position on the Broward School Board unsuccessfully but am still very much involved.  In December I was appointed by a School Board member to the Broward Diversity Committee and the liberal media is having a fit over it!  The media continue to try to portray myself and any others that dare oppose the homosexual agenda in schools, such as the GLSEN (Gay, Lesbian, Straight Education Network) Partnership as evil, hateful bigots, etc.  I dare to tell the truth and expose the misrepresentations that homosexual activists make in their relentless effort to infiltrate the Education System with the \"sexual orientation\" propaganda.  Please help us protect the innocent children.  NONE are born gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered as they claim.  \n \nI have been invited to the Martin Luther King prayer breakfast by my friends, Dr. O'Neal & Leketia Dozier.  I look forward to seeing you then. \n \nPerhaps you can put me in touch with the proper people in the Education Department and get this idea moving.\n \nThank you,\n \nMargaret Hostetter\nFormer candidate for Broward County Schools\n480 Sumter Avenue\nDavie, FL  33325\n954-452-9577\nemail@MargaretHostetter.US\n \nwww.MargaretHostetter.US\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n"

The Hispanic residents of the 8.5 Square Mile Area supported you and would do anything for you.  They really believed that you would stand up against this injustice and get the levee that a Democratic Congressman had promised in 1989.  Yet, if the rumors are true, you are rewarding the environmental community who treated you shabbily at the truly great expense of those who revered and stood by you.  Why would you do this? It truly baffles me. I have an e-mail from the Corps that says 77 residences will have to be removed by the 6(d) plan and I was told that there are at least 19 businesses.  I hope that it is merely because you are not being given the facts that you would choose the plan of those who treated you badly over the interests of this rural Hispanic community.  The interesting thing is that  Congressman Dante B. Fascell who supported them in the past was a liberal Democrat with no penchant for private property rights.  He supported the original plan to protect the 8.5 SMA because he thought it was good for the Everglades.  He was right. \n\nGod Bless You, \n\n\nJoette Lorion \n"

We married in the beautiful city of Oaxaca, Mexico on November 23, 2001.  I have submitted for my husband the I-130 and the \n\nI-129F from the U.S.  He has never been to the States and has never applied for a tourist visa, therefore, the only way he can come is with the approval of any one of these two visas.  We are now expecting our first child in April of this year.  I have not heard from Immigration at all in regards to the status other than having received their receipt notices.  \n\nNext month I will enter my last trimester and I will not be able to travel to visit my husband anymore.  In planning for my delivery, my closest relative is 3.5 hours away and I only get 6 - 8 weeks of maternity leave from work.  Although having a family was our choice, we want to do this correctly - AS A FAMILY - and having someone close to me during my last months of pregnancy is important, as well as having someone who I trust 100% help me care for our child when I return to work.\n\nI understand that Immigration in the US has taken a complete turn.  I do understand.  But this is my first child and being far from my husband and or family makes the last few months difficult to handle.  I am fortunate that at the moment my pregnancy is going well and that I can continue to work.  I am greatful for what I have, but my husband and I married because we wanted to be together for the rest of our lives and have a family as a family, together, and not thousands of miles apart.\n\nIs there anything that you suggest I do?  Anyone that I can contact?  Anyone else that I can write to?  ANY assistance or guidance that you can give me will be much appreciated.\n\nBelow I detail the information regarding my petitions for my husband.  Again, I apologize for the intrusion but as a father and a family man I hope you understand my situation.  \n\nThank you for your time and patience, \n\nMarilyn Meyreles \n1521 Kelby Road \nKissimmee, Florida 34747 \nTel:  407-397-3748 / 407-846-8717 \n\nI-130 - Immigrant Petition for Relative, Fiance (e), or Orphan Section Husband or Wife of U.S. Citizen. \nDate application was received:  January 23, 2002 \nReceipt/Case Number:  SRC-02-089-53678 \nBeneficiary:  Lorenzo Martin Ramirez Vicente \nReceipt Notice says the case should take 175 - 225 days.

Chairman Dudley has said construction is \"subject to\" the legislature making the money available. He said, though, that the rail amendment doesn't force lawmakers to do so. Is that your reading as well? And, if it is, will you work to prevent the system from being built?\n \n2) Chairman Dudley has suggested that rail board members make a final recommendation without knowing which route through Central Florida they were selecting. Making the decision \"blind,\" the chairman says, would focus only on the bottom line and eliminate any concern about the lobbying of his son and daughter-in-law. What are your thoughts about  this \"blind\" selection process? Is it worth considering or does it pose too many problems?\n \n3) While it's true there is no legal conflict, Chairman Dudley proposed the \"blind\" recommendation process, in part, to eliminate any questions about his family connections. Doesn't that suggest there is an appearance problem the authority and the state needs to deal with?\n \nThanks in advance,\nJim Stratton\nOrlando Sentinel\n407-420-5379\n \n -----Original Message-----\n"

Since his\nappointment, Novack has been relentless in trying to get to the bottom of\nthe problems within the School District that are preventing Miami-Dade\nCounty students from getting a decent education and actually placing them in\ndanger by failing to meet minimum safety standards.  \n\n   Novack has uncovered a billion unspent dollars languishing in the\nschool's budget while badly needed new schools fail to come out of the\nground.  Even more disturbing are allegations in the news that new schools\nhave problems with leaking and mold due to faulty construction by\ncontractors and a lack of supervision by the District.  Taxpayer money is\nwasted and these school contractors are laughing all the way to the bank. \n\n   This excessive waste of our resources combined with the lackadaisical\napproach to managing our public schools is out of control.  News report\nafter news report has exposed the School District's incompetence and lack of\ndirection, yet denial and evasions of responsibility seem to be the only\nresult.  Your continued vigilance is required to effect any substantial\nchange in this process.  \n   \nSincerely,\n\n\nL.N. Steinfeld\n9180 Byron Avenue\nSurfside, FL  33154\n\n"

There is going to be a \nlarge, very large number of educators leaving the profession on DROP, \nsome this year and many more in the next two.  Many of them are in \ntheir early 50's, can't turn away from the lump sum to be received, \nbut are not wanting to leave the profession.  Isn't there any way to \namend, waive, whatever some of the requirements so that these \nexceptionally talented educators can stay on in some capacity?  We \nwill be losing the \"cream of the crop\" in many instances.\nWe are in a crisis mode seeking educators who are talented, \ncertified, and motivated.  This group leaving is going to leave a \nvoid that we cannot fill in the urgent timeframe we face.\n\nIdea number two which is one I have brought up in other circles on an \ninformal basis:  The Colleges of Education in the state have revamped \ntheir programs in the last few years out of necessity (FSU's Physical \nEd. and Music being two with which I am most familiar, even their \nscience)  .   They need to continue to revamp.   We are constantly \nworking with them in providing the training ground for their interns. \nLocally, even TCC is sending out pre-interns.  What a wealth of \npotential educators that is!  We have developed a co-teaching model \nin  my school, out of necessity, for class size attention and for \nsubject area expertise.  The interns could easily assume more of a \nteacher role in a co-teaching model.   There should be a creative way \nto use these educational interns in addressing the needs of our \nschools and students while meeting their own experience needs.  How \nmuch better this would be than seeking those outside the profession \nto come in.  Teachers in the field may resent the fact that an \nindividual (as has been proposed) can come in and assume a teaching \nrole along side a certified teacher who has worked long and hard \nmeeting all kinds of requirements to teach.  We need to have ALL \neducators in all educational facilities in the state working \ntogether.  I remain less than confident that those inside the \nlegislature have a grasp of the challenges in the educational world \nin our state just now.  Teachers need to be handled with \"kid gloves\" \nin most cases if we are to get from them the very best for our \nstudents.  Another garbled message, but maybe some sense.\n\nJust some ideas!

        "body": "\nDear Jeb:\n\n As your appointee to the Tri-County Commuter Rail Authority, I am pleased to report to you that this year has been an exceptional one for Tri-Rail and regional transportation efforts.   Ridership is at an all time high and double tracking is proceeding on schedule \u2013 we expect to be able to add additional trains within the next six months.  We are planning direct connections to South Florida\u2019s major seaports with an eye toward creating a state of the art intramodal transportation facility.  We have also been successful in supporting a critical step forward for regionalism and regional transportation: unanimous support from the county commissions and regional business community for transforming Tri-Rail into a Regional Transportation Authority with a dedicated funding source. \n\n As you know, representatives of South Florida\u2019s business communities are flying up to Tallahassee next week to participate in a legislative luncheon and discussion about the proposed Authority.  Spearheaded by the regional business community, the legislation and the proposed $ 2.00 user fee on vehicle registrations and renewals has received the unanimous endorsement of the Monroe, Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, and Martin County Commissions. My understanding is that this legislation will be sponsored by the three legislative delegations chairs, Senator Geller and Representatives Garcia and Machek with the rest of the delegation supporting as co-sponsors.\n\nI realize that your time is of the utmost importance and limited, however, the Regional Business Alliance will be hosting the luncheon (to which you are invited) on Wednesday, January 22 from 12:00 \u2013 1:30 p.m. on the 22nd Floor of the Capitol.  The business community, and I personally, would greatly appreciate not only your support and endorsement but your active involvement in ensuring that this milestone of Tri-County cooperation is implemented under your leadership and that South Florida, and Florida, is positioned to maximize its efforts in Washington during this year\u2019s reauthorization of TEA21.\n\n Again, it has been a personally rewarding and satisfying experience to serve on the Tri-Rail board. My fellow members have honored me by electing me to the position of Vice-Chair after serving less than one year.  It\u2019s been a great year and the future holds great possibilities.  But we need your help and leadership to make the South Florida\u2019s Regional Transportation Authority, and a better South Florida, a reality. \n\n Thanks again for allowing me to play a small part in making Florida a better place to be.\n\n Best Regards,\n\n \n\n   \n\nMichael\n\n"

The problem is, our current system still rewards irresponsible behavior and has no real consequences to the parent if they raise irresponsible, uneducated children.      \n \nI offer these totally politically incorrect (but likely effective) solutions:\n \n1.   If a woman gets pregnant while receiving either state or federal income based benefits, all benefits should be cut off and she should be required to move into a group home with responsible supervision since she is obviously not responsible enough to avoid having a new child when she can't even afford to support those she already has.\n \n2.   Create a program that rewards girls for not getting pregnant until they are at least 18, and have a full time job..    Through the school, you can notify girls from 6th grade up that if they abstain from having sex until they have graduated and get a job, they will get $25,000 reward.     (sounds like a lot but its far cheaper than what it costs to support a welfare momma and even one child.\n \n3.    Require all recipients of any tax funded program  (medicaid, free lunch, etc) who is not working full time to be required to attend school to learn marketable skills.    No person feeding at the public trough, taking money that was earned by someone else, should be allowed to sit home while those forced by taxation to support her are working.    THERE SHOULD BE NO EXCEPTIONS.  Either they are working full time to qualify for benefits, or they are going to school to learn skills to get them self-sufficient.\n \nOf course, expecting parasites feeding at the public trough to work or study as hard as those they are feeding off is probably just too politically incorrect .............. but the fact is, it is likely as companies like Wipro expand and provide greater and greater competition to high tech workers in America (read story in Fast Company magazine , 2/03 issue if you want a real eye opener), and as American companies try to compete for the business of American consumers and businesses .....    we need every single person who has not earned their retirement leisure time to be working,  or spending a full 40 hours a week learning skills so they can work.     IF FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN DEMOGRAPHICS, THE TIPPING POINT BETWEEN COLLAPSE AND SURVIVAL MAY BE JUST A FEW PERCENT MORE AMERICANS WORKING OR NOT.   (and if companies that have pension plans either need to put much more money in  (latest report is just the S&P 500 companies are $243 billion underfunded) which will result in lower earning, possibly lower dividends and likely lower stock prices, and if they can't swing that, many are talking of switch to cash balance plan which could lower income for future retirees by 10-30% .....).   WE NEED EVERY PHYSICALLY ABLE 21-60 YEAR TO BE SELF-SUFFICIENT AND NOT A BURDEN TO HIS/HER FELLOW AMERICANS.\n \nI wonder how long many americans will be asking something akin to \"who is joh Galt?\"\n \nIlene Davis\n \n"

Bush,\n \nI will try to keep this brief as I know you have plenty to keep you busy. \n \nIn regards to the most recent Board of Dentistry appointments I am shocked with one in particular\n.\nDr. Carl Melzer is understandable, even though it would have been nice to have retained the sitting chair\n.\nDr. Stanley Levsky is very bizarre to say the least.  The talk in the dental community is \"who is he, how is he qualified and where is he?\" I tried to call him to congratulate him on being appointed and try to get a line of communication started.\n \nFirst, he is not employed by Taylor Correctional Institution. They referred my call to Manatee County Correctional Institution. He is not employed there. The number they gave to call was his home.\nI did call his home only to be told he was not available and would get back with me last night or today. As of now I have not heard from him.\nOne of the periodontist called to state that she thought he was practicing dentistry in Illinois. In checking with the DOH his practice address is the same as the address he gave as his home on his application for Board appointment.\nIt is my understanding Dr. Levsky would need to be practicing dentistry in Florida for this appointment.\n \nDentist in Florida and members of the Florida Dental Association take the appointments to the Board of Dentistry seriously. When the Florida Dental Association gives endorsements for the Board, we do so with recommendations that they are some of the most ethical and highly respected members of our organization. Our reputation for serving the public is on the line and we do not want failures. \n \nI know there must have been a reason for this appointment, but from all I can gather there were certainly more well qualified dentists that could have served.\n \nThank you for taking the time to read this and hopefully you can give an indication as to why this appointment was made over others.\n \nDonald Cadle\nImmediate Past President FDA\n"

After the high-speed line is built, it will be used for many years. And to use the high-speed train, it is only necessary to buy a ticket. Here is another 'Insane' idea, Orange County wants to spend $2.5 billion to widen Interstate 4 and other roads. \n\"Trying to cure traffic congestion by adding more capacity is like trying to cure obesity by loosening one's belt.\" In order to drive on our roads, a car is required.

They have earned this respect for their service and sacrifice.\n \nIt is not for any others to determine the appropriate way for them to spend this national day of remembrance.\n \nI speak as daughter of an Army Air Corp Pilot who was not fortunate enough to return from WWII and an army nurse who served in Europe.  My ex husband is also a Vietnam vet. \n \nVeteran's Day was always a time to both celebrate our blessings and remember our losses.  \n \nYou said you have received many e-mails against making this a holiday.  I wonder the rational behind this lack of consideration for veterans employed by the school district, and I believe we should get information about who has organized folks to protest a holiday for veterans.  \n \nThis is a very unusual position to take especially as so many young men and women are presently taking leave from their families to serve and protect our country.\n \nThis brings to mind the opposition of the last board when they were asked last year to honor a Lee Middle School teacher killed in the line of duty in Afghanistan.  \n \nPlease rethink this position, and support a paid holiday for Veterans Day.  \n \nMarie Dinon\n"

The impending election, if the truth be told isn't that difficult of a problem given cooler heads prevailing. Let's get Oliphant through the municipal elections. I think if we demonstrate every effort to help her and we incur problems in March - I would be the first to ask her to step aside - and I think she would listen. \nYou, as governor have little to gain by being the guy who axed Miriam. A lot of this stuff is more hyperbole, egos and politics than anything I've ever seen.\nBy inserting a mediator to get us through an election next month and March we can work on cooling this thing down and working it out. The county commission doesn't want this to happen.\nI've spoken to both Dorsey Miller and Alcee hastings about this mediation concept and they both think its a palatable way to resolve this issue. I'd like to talk to you about it further if you care. Dorsey's in Wash. DC but said he would call you.\nIf you wish to reach me you can contact me at (954) 345-1822 (office) or my cell at (954) 558-5139.\n\nHope all is well otherwise and wishing you well.

Collegis, based in suburban Orlando, Fla., works with the university in accordance with U. of L's strategic plan for revenue growth and enhanced academic opportunity by developing, marketing and sourcing students for certification programs in business and information technology (IT), such as those that lead to higher paying careers in the technology sector.\n\nThe corporation, with nearly 100 college and university clients nationwide, also provides content, instructional services, marketing and student recruitment services to help advance students in their careers and help generate increased exposure and revenues for the university. The U. of L program has been successful in its first four months of existence.\n\n\"We're pleased with the early development of this program and optimistic about the curriculum solutions we'll be able to provide to the greater Louisville community,\" said Gale Rhodes, director of the University of Louisville's Division of Distance and Continuing Education (DDCE). \"This business relationship expands our offerings of real-world education programs that improve the career prospects of our students, and significantly enhances our ability to attract and retain those students.\"\n\nThe course offerings target adult learners, such as existing technology professionals and those individuals seeking to enter the IT profession, and include a wide range of industry-leading information technology programs and essential business courses that provide students with the skills and knowledge necessary to be successful in today's organizations. Corporations seeking flexible and expert training options for their employees are also drawn to the programs, which utilize a blend of technology tools and in-person instruction that allows the DDCE to create customized solutions that meet the specific needs of their corporate clientele. The opportunity to receive this training in the academic atmosphere provided by the university may spark increased enrollments, both in certificate and degree-granting programs.\n\n\"With the development of technology in so many areas of business, our students can turn to us for a leg up on instruction and career development,\" said Rhodes. \"We'll continue to explore creative ways to reach our students and build a community of learners into a broader community of earners. That's what this Collegis relationship is all about and why U. of L's motto is 'Dare to be great.'\"\n\nAbout Collegis Inc.:\nFounded in 1986, Collegis Inc. is a leading provider of integrated strategic advisory, education delivery and technology management solutions to higher education institutions in the United States.

        "body": "Cc:\tJeb Bush\n\nDear Senators, \n\nWe are categorically opposed to Sen. Cowin's SB 178. \n\n\nAs you know, Sen. Cowin has proposed an amendment to F.S. 419.001(2) which in addition to requiring a 1,000 foot separation between community residential homes for people with developmental disabilities, would require another 500 foot separation from any single family residence. \n\n\nAs we have stated to Sen. Cowin, to distance a group home 500 feet from any single family residence in addition to distancing them from each other by 1,000 feet, would virtually ban them from single family residential areas and relegate them to the boon docks.  This step backwards reverses all progress we have made to integrate people with developmental disabilities into regular neighborhoods, to treat them as equals with all those inalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness that we cherish.  This bill also opposes President Bush's New Freedom Initiative, a comprehensive plan to tear down barriers that prevent people with disabilities from fully participating in community life. \n\n\nWhat is an intolerable situation is the movement to rule out the same opportunity of freedom of choice in housing whether it be in a typical neighborhood, a subdivision or a planned residential community. \n\n\nI would like to refer you to the Fair Housing Act and its intent to allow all individuals, regardless of their race, color, religion, sex, handicap familial status or national origin, equal opportunity of choice of dwelling. \n\n\nIn the recent decision by the District Court of Appeal of Florida, Second District (Case No. 2D01 - 4527) the court ruled that the enforcement of the restrictive covenants against group homes is discriminatory and contrary to state and federal law: \n\n\nIn applying the terms of the FHAA, the federal courts have  determined that one may be guilty of discrimination in any one of three ways.  First, the Act prohibits intentional discriminatory conduct towards a handicapped person.  Second, the Act prohibits incidental discrimination, that is, an act that results in making property unavailable to a handicapped person.  Third, the Act prohibits an act that fails to make a reasonable accommodation that would allow a handicapped person the enjoyment of the chosen residence. . . . We are persuaded that, given the similarity of language and purpose in the federal and the Florida legislation, this three-pronged approach applies equally to the Florida Fair Housing Act.\n\nI also refer you to Olmstead v Childs.  As stated by the court, each disabled person is entitled to treatment in the most integrated setting possible for that person. Additionally, President Bush's New Freedom Initiative is a comprehensive plan to tear down barriers that prevent people with disabilities from fully participating in community life. \n\nTo quote one of the many voices we have heard in support of equality and freedom for people with developmental disabilities: \n\n\nI think of affirmative action, which has been in the news lately.  For individuals who have been discriminated against, for many years, the government's position was NOT to narrow the options for them.  No, it was the government's position to make possible what was not possible previously by opening up options and opportunities for those individuals. And then allowing those individuals to make choices.  -- Sue Cannon, Senior Education Specialist, Parent-to-Parent, Brevard County.\n\nWe have spent years in an effort to mainstream our children with developmental disabilities into the schools.  Now it is time to mainstream them into the community. \n\nI urge you to withdraw SB 178. \n\n\nSincerely, \nLila Klausman \nMelbourne Beach \n356 Las Olas Dr., Melbourne Beach, FL 32951    Tel:  321 724-8899 \n\n\nMember, Family Care Council, District 7 \nPres., Parents Planning Programs (PPP) for the Developmentally Disabled of Florida, Inc. \nDirector, Florida's Voice on Mental Retardation (FVMR)\n\n"

As the immediate past Chairman of the Senate Ethic and Elections Committee, I have stood by watching the mockery made of the carefully crafted revised election laws passed in 2001, and revisited and refined in 2002.  We worked diligently to address each of the reported problems that occurred during the 2000 elections.\n       It appears one of her first actions following her election was to get rid of Sam Goren as the lawyer for the Supervisor of Election's Office.  Sam is one of the most ethical lawyers I have ever met!  He knew the Election Laws backward and forward, and she would have been well advised to have kept him.  Perhaps, she would not be facing some of her criticism she justly deserves today.  \n       She is an attractive and charming lady, but she has been a total embarrassment to those of us who live in Broward.  Across the board, Democrats and Republicans, black and white, the comments are the same.  It is not a race issue, as some would have others believe, it is an incompetence issue.  Nowhere else in the state have we had the ongoing chaos, as we have experienced here in Broward County.\n       She should have been removed following the Primary disaster in September 2002.  The hemorrhaging must stop, and soon.  Please help us.\n                                                       With warm regards,\n                                                       Sen.

You and others receiving this letter via electronic mail have the power to put a stop to this pattern and practice and to enforce the proper use of State Mediation, which would, undoubtedly, yield better educational results for children and youth with disabilities.  I have raised these issues with you in the past, but they continue to surface.\n\nThe State mediation conference held on January 15, 2003 in Broward County, Florida in the above mentioned case initiated by the Broward County School Board against A.A., not only failed to yield any agreement, but left the parents with even deeper wounds and with a clear understanding that the only reason why the Broward County School Board agreed to participate in State Mediation was just to \"bully\" them a little more.  More importantly, it left A.A., a second grader, whose gap in visual motor integration skills has grown to over two years of age, and which significantly impacts his access to education as manifested in his poor writing ability, without the related service of Occupational Therapy (OT) that he so desperately needs, and that his parents have been requesting since he was a preschooler.  The School Board of Broward County continues to deny him the related services that he is entitled to receive to benefit from special education.  It is important to understand that all of this is over Broward County School Board continuing to deny a second grader receiving special education services since the age of 3 with one hour a week of Occupational Therapy related services.  \n\nMediation began with the School Board bringing a surprise guest to the mediation conference, not included in the list previously provided from your office regarding the mediation participants.  As it was, the School Board had double the number of participants, including their surprise guest and the School Board Lawyer, Mr. Ed Marko.  Mr. Marko was quick to announce that none of the other participants representing the School Board were allowed to speak during the mediation conference and that he was the only lawyer who had ever litigated IDEA cases in Broward County, having litigated many of them.  He stated that the only individuals with authority to speak during the mediation conference were Ms. Grace McDonald, Due Process Coordinator, and himself, School Board Lawyer.  Indeed, Mr. Marko and Ms. McDonald were the only participants from the School Board who spoke during mediation.  Of course, this is contrary to the rules and against the spirit of participating in mediation in good faith, not to mention against the human spirit and against our constitutional right, which also extends to employees of the School Board, of freedom of speech.  \n\nA telephone call initiated by me from my cellular telephone to Dr. Palazesi from the mediation conference, which was followed by a conversation between Dr. Palazesi and Mr. Rex Hart, mediator, resulted in Mr. Hart asking the surprise guest to wait outside of the mediation room.\n\nMr. Marko also insisted in forcing the parents to give up rights afforded to them under the \"Procedural Safeguards for Exceptional Students\", although Mr. Hart had announced at the beginning of the session, in accordance with the \"Procedural Safeguards for Exceptional Students,\" that mediation was not used to waive any rights afforded to the parents or the student.  \n\nAt the end of the mediation conference, when no agreement was reached, Mr. Hart announced that he was destroying his notes.  Following the information written on Dr. Palazesi's letter establishing the \"procedures for mediation,\" which reads, in pertinent part:  \"Any notes taken during the mediation should be destroyed at the end of the session...\"  I asked Mr. Hart if he was going to ask the other participants to destroy their notes as well, but he said that he had no power to do so.  I asked Mr. Marko, who had taken copious notes during the mediation conference, to destroy his notes, but he replied that he was not going to do so unless I had a ruling that required him to destroy his notes.  He added that as an attorney he found it inappropriate to destroy the notes that he had taken during mediation in a case that was pending a hearing.  I asked him:  \"Are you then using this mediation session as a discovery tool?\"  He answered:  \"Unless you can perform a lobotomy on me.\"  \n\nI, on the other hand, was happy to remain ethical and true to the mediation process and, abiding per the State mediation procedures, destroyed all the notes that I took during the mediation conference at the end of the mediation conference.  \n\nAgain, you and others in a supervisory capacity who are receiving this letter via electronic mail have the power to put a stop to this pattern and practice and to enforce the proper use of State Mediation.  We request and trust that you will do so, so that children and youth with disabilities and their parents can have access to a system of State Mediation as it was intended to be used: as a tool to \"resolve disagreements relating to the identification, evaluation, educational placement, or the provision of a free appropriate public education...\" to the child, and not  as a discovery tool for School Board Lawyers and as another opportunity to deny services to children while bullying their parents.  \n\nA written reply is requested.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nLilliam Rangel-Diaz\nCENTER FOR EDUCATION ADVOCACY\n8600 S.W. 92nd Street, Suite 204\nMiami, Florida  33156\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

On\nApril 15th, 2002 I suffered a medically induced heart attack because the\nBCBS approved Physician I went to the day before patted me on the head and\nsaid, \"Everybody suffers Indigestion sometimes.\" The next day, in total\nfrustration, I went to my former doctor and in less then five minutes I was\nin the Critical Cardiac Unit. The approved BCBS Physician had administered\nabout four times as much medication as needed. \n\nLast October I found out that my heart is fine now but to keep it that way I\nneed a better wheelchair, namely one with automatic elevating leg-rests and\nreclining. After much searching and lots of measuring the permobil was\nselected to be the best. Two physicians and one physical therapist wrote up\nall the needed paperwork and we spent hours explaining the need to the\nmedical review team. \n\nBCBS came back with the finding that they would pay for the base of the\nchair, the batteries, the armrests but not the seat or the leg-rests. The\nDME provider and I argued for hours that it makes no sense to approve 4\nwheels and a motor without the seat. That's a bit like buying a car with no\nsteering device. \n\nThinking that they may have mistaken the term \"base of the chair\" as \"basic\nchair\" we sent them a picture of their approved parts, to no avail.\n\nI am still a Medicaid Waiver Provider and working full-time but unless I am\nallowed to have a workable wheelchair that allows me to remain pain free I\nmay not be able to continue.\n\nThis is only the latest debacle with BCBS. Can your office assist with this\nproblem? \n\nI look forward to hearing from you again.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBirgit Wilhelm \n\n\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of Florida, Inc., and its subsidiary and \naffiliate companies are not responsible for errors or omissions in this\ne-mail message.

The state wants to preserve a source of tax revenue \n \nI offer what I believe are two simple solutions that I believe are fair to all parties concerned:\n \n1.   If citrus owners want to ensure the safety of their groves, and hence their income and wealth, a simple solution would be to create a 1900 foot \"tree free \"canker-break\"  (like a fire break used to hald the progress of a fire)  around all their groves.  This could be accomplished either by either cutting down a 1900 foot \"moat\" of existing trees, buying up 1900 feet of land surrounding the groves, or paying homeowners who live within 1900 feet an annual fee to remain citrus tree free.\n \n2.   Let grove owners who want to protect their groves create a \"mature tree fund\" that included mature trees and a cash fund to pay for cost of replacement referenced below.   (the state could protect its tax revenue from citrus  industry by providing a tax credit of some kind to partly offset cost to grow owners).  Since the only benefit of removing a healthy tree would be to protect the income and wealth of a \"citrus industry member\" and the taxes they pay, it should be required that the state make the injured party truly whole by replacing any healthy tree that is removed with one of comparable maturity and fruit bearing ability.    The \"mature tree fund\" referenced above, funded by the industry whose wealth and income is being protected, would be the source of the tree and funds to replant.     \n \nTHE ONLY REQUIREMENT ON PROPERTY OWNERS THAT MAKES SENSE IN THE INTERESTS OF \"THE PUBLIC GOOD\" IS A REQUIREMENT THAT ANY INFECTED TREE BE REMOVED IMMEDIATELY.  \n \nBoth these solutions would provide a fair way for citrus industy members to protect their own income and wealth, while not depriving individual tree owners of their right to free fruit and property value protection.\n \nIlene Davis\nCocoa FL\n321/631-1127\n \n"

ESA is paying Florida Tech $800,000 to base its biology experiments there, and is providing opportunities for Florida Tech professors and students to participate in the research.  Among the ESA experiments: research into how bone cells add or absorb calcium in microgravity (research that applies directly to both osteoporosis and long space travel); how certain infectious bacteria multiply; and the influence of microgravity on radiation damage to DNA in human cells.  With a newly installed high-speed computer link between Florida Tech and KSC, the scientists will monitor and even control experiments onboard the shuttle from the university.

The report, Quality Counts 2003: \"If I Can't Learn From You,\" examines what all 50 states and the District of Columbia are doing to attract, retain, and support well-qualified teachers for students in high-poverty, high-minority, and low-achieving schools. In addition, Education Week surveyed 30 large school districts about courses of action to improve teacher quality in high-need schools. The report also includes an analysis of the working conditions for teachers in such schools. Quality Counts 2003 also charts progress in other facets of states' education systems, providing state report cards, profiles, and extensive data tables.

After spending hours over the summer searching online for material to enhance their courses, then bookmarking the links on their computers or assembling them on class web sites, teachers later find that many of the links no longer work. \"It's very frustrating-when you find a great activity, a web quest, or research, and you go to the web site and it's down,\" said Kelly L. Luton, who teaches Spanish at the 4,200-student Robinson Secondary School in Fairfax County, VA.  Support from a school technology coordinator and a library media specialist can greatly ease the burden of link checking. Those professionals sometimes have the skill to help the teacher \"whack\" an important site -- that is, make a copy of it so the teacher can use it off-line. \n\nOthers call for government or education organizations or professional societies to start pooling resources in public digital libraries that are highly stable, so educators can depend on them. One such effort by the Arlington, VA-based National Science Teachers Association, for example, recruited 150 master science teachers over the past three years to spend parts of their summer collecting links for a special archive of science-related content for educators. The links selected by these so-called web watchers are organized in web guides categorized by grade level and scientific topic. The first eight web guides will be posted online at  <http://www.nsta.org> www.nsta.org and will be carefully maintained and gradually expanded, according to Tyson A. Brown, the manager of the program.  Target Marketing Inc. also maintains a non-profit directory of educationally focused websites at  <http://www.targetmarketing.org/course/> http://www.targetmarketing.org/course/. \n\nTeachers Protest Fee Charged For Teaching Out Of Their Field (Source: TCEB)\n\nLouisiana is unfairly charging teachers $25 when they teach outside their area of expertise, education groups said. \"It is extortion,\" said Julie Cherry, president of the East Baton Rouge Federation of Teachers. \"We are already talking about people who are overworked and underpaid,\" Cherry said. \"You don't have someone to fill their position but you are going to charge them for it? I think it is ridiculous.\" Teachers sometimes are assigned to classes outside their area of certification, or expertise, because of teacher shortages. For instance, an English teacher may be pressed into teaching a science class because of a lack of science teachers. \"They have either voluntarily stepped forward to fill a void or have been assigned out of their fields involuntarily,\" Cherry's letter said. \"They should not be penalized because of their professionalism and willingness to go the extra mile.\"\n\nRoughly 7,500 of the state's 50,000 or so public classroom teachers are either uncertified or teaching outside their areas of expertise. Certified teachers have to earn a college education degree, finish with at least a 2.5 grade point average, and pass a national teacher exam. State officials said the $25 fee stems in part from new federal legislation designed to improve public schools. The measure is called the No Child Left Behind Act. One of the goals of the new law is that all teachers should be certified by the 2005-06 school year. That means the state has to heavily supervise those working outside their specialty, said Janet Reed, division director for state Teacher Standards, Assessment and Certification. \"We can't do that if we don't know who they are,\" Reed said. Reed said the $25 fee helps finance the cost for state officials to evaluate the transcripts of those teaching outside their area of certification, technical assistance so those teachers can win certification in their new subject, and other work. \n\nTechnology-Based Economic Development & Venture Funding\n\nFlorida Ranks as Second Best State for Entrepreneurs (Sources: SGPB & MSN)\n\nFlorida is rated number two among the 50 states in a composite ranking of the business environment for entrepreneurs and small businesses.  The Microsoft bCentral rating is a compilation of two recent studies: Small Business Survival Index 2002:  Ranking the Policy Environment for Entrepreneurship Across the Nation; and Entrepreneurial Hot Spots: The Best Places in America to Start and Grow a Company, 2001.  The \"Survival Index\" is a product of the Small Business Survival Committee, an advocacy group based in Washington, D.C., which quantifies government-imposed costs on businesses.  The \"Entrepreneurial Hot Spots\" were identified by Cognetics, a Massachusetts firm that researches America's fastest-growing small companies and measures entrepreneurial activity.  Tax issues predominated in the ranking factors, but other factors such as operating and labor costs also contributed to the South\u2019s success.

Neither the states nor the small manufacturers are capable of replacing a loss in federal funding for MEP,\" the governors say. \"As our economy struggles to recover, MEP is needed more than ever. It plays an important role in our state and national economies that no other entity is likely to fulfill.\" \n \nMEP is a national network of centers with 400 offices across the country and Puerto Rico that provide technical assistance and business support services to American manufacturers. The program helps small and mid-sized manufacturers adopt new technologies, processes, and business practices. In FY 2000 alone, MEP clients reported that completed projects created or retained 25,000 jobs, increased or retained sales of $2.3 billion and saved $483 million in costs nationwide.  The letter to the appropriation leaders comes at a critical time. The Administration requested only $12.9 million for the $106.5 million program last February. Although MEP has bipartisan support in Congress, funding for the program remains undecided.

It should not be lost on the governors the important role tech-based economic development plays in strengthening state and local economies through higher wage jobs and more competitive businesses. Do their speeches bear that out? \n \nDuring the past 10 days, inaugural addresses were given in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Wisconsin and Wyoming. State of the State speeches were made in California, Connecticut, Idaho, New York, North Dakota, Virginia and West Virginia. Governors in Colorado, North Dakota, Virginia, and Wyoming delivered budget messages as they presented their budget proposals to the state legislature. Recent highlights show tech-based economic development remains a bipartisan priority for many states: \n \nCalifornia  - Governor Gray Davis, Inaugural & State of the State Addresses, January 6 & 8, 2003 \n\n\"[W]e will make California the world's nucleus for life science innovation. This sector of the economy, perhaps more than any other, has high-growth potential, high wages for its workers, and a higher purpose - using cell technology to build healthier, happier lives. We'll build on our existing successes to put California at the center of this remarkable industry.\" \n \n\"I will ask the Public Utilities Commission to create an Office of Economic Development. It will review all major proceedings before the PUC to determine their benefit to the economy, infrastructure and job creation. \n \n\"Every large economy needs a vibrant manufacturing base. So I will ask you to extend the Manufacturers' Investment Credit. This credit is widely recognized as creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs... \n \n\"To keep California on the cutting-edge of this life-saving field [life sciences], we need to launch a new Life Sciences Initiative. My Administration will focus on three things: one, increasing the number of qualified lab technicians. Two, working with the University of California to simplify the transfer of technology. Three, increasing access to venture capital and federal grants.\" \n \nMaine - Governor John Baldacci, Inaugural Address, January 8, 2003 \n\n\"[W]e cannot let the temporary budget troubles divert our attention from the bigger challenge of strengthening Maine's economy. In the coming weeks, I will be putting forth a detailed economic strategy. It will include \"Pine Tree\" opportunity zones to spur economic development in areas of Maine that really need it; a doubling of our investment in research and development to support emerging industries like biomedical research at Jackson Lab; one-stop shopping for business and trade information; and a more consolidated, consistent emphasis on regional and international opportunities with the other New England states and the maritime provinces of Canada... \n \n\"One of the ways we will address [Maine's lag nationally in postsecondary performance] is by transforming the state's technical colleges into a true Community College System offering a full range of programs and making the best use of all our existing resources, including the University campuses and K-12 schools. To enhance higher education opportunities in Maine, our public higher education systems need to work collaboratively and efficiently. I have discussed this with the Chancellor of the University System and the President of the Technical College System, both of whom share this belief.\" \n \nNew York - Governor George Pataki, State of the State Address, January 8, 2003 \n\n\"And while we deal with the immediate [fiscal] crisis we must also look beyond today and focus our sights and our energies towards the bright future that awaits us tomorrow. For we know that if we act responsibly, the crisis before us will be temporary, and if we build on the remarkable progress we've already made, the promise of the future we seek will be unlimited. \n \n\"...we must pay special attention to the needs of the new high-tech economy. Two years ago, I set forth a simple but powerful idea: Combine the power of our high-tech industry with the strengths of our top-flight academic institutions \u2013 add active State government support \u2013 and we can create a new economy and a new prosperity for New York. This notion is embodied in our Centers of Excellence \u2013 a network of high-tech research and economic development centers stretching from Buffalo to Brookhaven \u2013 creating an Empire State High Tech Corridor that teams our universities with industry. \n \n\"... But we need to continue our momentum by expanding our Empire State High Tech Corridor. Therefore, we are moving forward with additional Centers of Excellence \u2013 in Westchester with leading research institutions like New York Presbyterian Hospital, Cornell and Columbia universities, New York Medical College, and companies like IBM and GE, focused on biotech... And in New York City, with Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Columbia, NYU and other medical research institutions, to build on the biotech industry and academic strengths there. \n \n\"We must build on the other high-tech and biotech investments we have made \u2013 in our STAR Centers, our Advanced Research Centers and our Centers for Advanced Technology \u2013 in places like Alfred, Binghamton, Potsdam and Ithaca, and throughout our Empire State High Tech Corridor. Industry and university collaboration are essential to our goal of creating a new economy in New York. \n \n\"This is a critical time in our State's history. All these new projects and initiatives hold promise and they are loaded with incredible potential. They need to be nurtured with the same energy that was used to conceive and attract them.\" \n \nNew Mexico - Governor Bill Richardson, Inaugural Address, January 1, 2003 \n\n\"The voters of New Mexico showed on Election Day that...they want a state government that supports sustainable business growth and technology development. They want New Mexico's state government to work with private business to create good, high wage jobs while protecting our state's precious natural resources...\" \n \n\"We will take advantage of our potentially enormous economic resources. We will reinvigorate our state universities, our national laboratories and work with the business community. We will actively promote the transfer of technology from the cutting-edge research of our labs to the private sector. We can nurture this growth to build a high-wage economy... \n \n\"We must bring our unique technological and scientific resources to the cutting-edge of the newest, environmentally friendly technologies. My administration will provide incentives for energy efficiency and the development of renewable energy sources. We will make New Mexico an exporter of the cleaner technologies of the future.\" \n \nIn related news, the Santa Fe New Mexican reported Wednesday that Governor Richardson announced he will ask the legislature to approve \"spending about $24 million on economic-development initiatives, including $15 million for an existing in-plant training program and a one-time $9 million endowment of professorships at the state's research universities: The University of New Mexico, New Mexico State University and New Mexico Tech.\" \n \nNorth Dakota - Governor John Hoeven, State of the State Address, January 7, 2003 \n\n\"I am asking you to make a major investment in North Dakota's future \u2013 an investment of more than $100 million \u2013 an investment in an initiative we call Smart Growth.

We must keep our best and brightest teachers here, to keep our students the best and brightest. \n\n- Better link our teachers to career development, to keep more of our young people in North Dakota. \n\n- Fully implement the Higher Education Roundtable strategy, including resources for Centers of Excellence, designed to maximize the synergy between education and entrepreneurial activity. \n\n- Develop ConnectND, a cutting edge information management system for the entire state - to provide schools and businesses with the tools they need to compete nationally.  \n\n- Launch new venture capital funds - to jumpstart business activity.  \n\n- Implement business internship programs - to help students launch careers in North Dakota. \n \n- Enhance career counseling and job placement - to make sure students find the right career and find the best opportunities in North Dakota.  Decouple state corporate income tax - to send a clear message to the world that North Dakota has a competitive tax structure, and that we are ready to do business. \n\n- Partner with the New Economy Initiative - to keep this vision before us at all times. \n\n- Offer a low-interest home buying program to attract and retain skilled workers in areas of shortages. \n\n- And create tax incentives to stimulate energy development and value-added agriculture, such as new initiatives for ethanol, and enhanced development of oil and gas. \n\nVirginia - Governor Mark Warner, State of the Commonwealth Address, January 8, 2003 \n\n\"...we currently have twenty-two workforce development programs spread across ten different agencies, in three secretariats. Too often, the current system doesn't help working Virginians when they need it most. That's why I have offered a comprehensive plan to move Virginia toward a coordinated statewide workforce development system. This plan improves the existing one-stop Workforce Development Centers. And we will FINALLY appoint a single, high-level state official to coordinate workforce development. \n\n\"And to target young adults without high school diplomas, we have proposed creating a \"middle college\" within the community college system. In the information age, when job skills are more important than ever, state government should help people gain new skills - not stand in their way. \n \n\"Looking beyond the session, we'll keep working to grow the economy by focusing on emerging industries and strengthening our traditional industries. \n \n\"In particular, advances in the life sciences offer tremendous economic opportunities, and I intend to build on the work that our biotechnology task force began this past year.\" \n \nWest Virginia - Governor Bob Wise, State of the State Address, January 8, 2003 \n\n\"I have also requested that we merge the Governor\u2019s Office of Technology with the Office of Information Services and Communications.

That is, you argue that racial diversity does not necessarily\npass the \"compelling interest\" test. It's also interesting in your brief\nthat your lawyers argue for a \"better way,\" touting One Florida with\nlanguage that is not at all legalistic but almost more political or\nideological.\n\nBeing an average civilian, I didn't realize this yesterday when I asked you\nabout your brief. So I ask now: Was it your intention to take a harder line\nthan the WH, and did you actually slip in the section about the \"better\nway?\"\n\nI'm asking because I am writing my Sunday column about this.\n\nBest,\nPeter\n"

        "body": "\n\nFlorida Guides Association \nColumn \n16 January 2003 \nCapt. Dave Markett \nSr. Vice President \n\n\n\nFlorida Guides Association wants to take this opportunity to point out more\npositive change in the winds blowing through Florida Fish and Wildlife\nConservation Commission (FWC). In an earlier column we noted one of the\nfirst acts under the leadership of newly appointed director Dr. Ken Haddad\nwas to convene a meeting of fish and wildlife interest groups to develop\nlong range strategic planning goals for the FWC as a whole. This represents\na dramatic shift in FWC attitude and direction from past leadership\npositions. \n\nComes now to FGA, notice of and an invitation to participate in, another\nstrategic planning session from FWC. In Tallahassee, on Wednesday, February\n5, Col. Julie Jones, newly appointed head of FWC Division of Law\nEnforcement, is convening a blue-ribbon panel of 60 key FWC \"Stakeholders\"\nto participate in setting future goals and direction for FWC / DLE. When was\nthe last time any state law enforcement group asked you for guidance and\ndirection as to what you felt the greatest needs for law enforcement\nimprovement were? FGA looks forward to active participation in this activity\nand we intend to point out some areas that we feel need attention. \n\nOne of the areas where FGA believes improvements are possible is a program\nof cooperation between FWC / DLE and the angler / guide community. Several\nyears ago, there was such a program developed by the old Florida Marine\nPatrol and Florida Conservation Association called \"Coast Watch\" wherein\nareas of habitual violations were more closely monitored. \n\nThat cooperative effort resulted in significant major marine resource\nviolations being identified and successfully prosecuted. FGA is not\nsuggesting that our members or recreational anglers take on the role of \"Big\nBrother\", but we feel that large scale or repeated marine resource\nviolations destroy the effectiveness of current fishing rules and most often\nlead to even more restrictive regulations. Something none of us wants to see\nhappen. \n\nFWC / DLE is also asking for input from interested members of the general\npublic as well. They have set up an online survey to better determine\nindividual opinions about the future direction of the Division of Law\nEnforcement. Take a moment, if you will, and reply to: \n\nwww.group-solutions.com/ss/wsb.dll/vern/flfd.htm/fwcbrc.htm \n\nThis is a unique opportunity for all / each of us to make our own\nsuggestions for improvements to the FWC / Division of Law Enforcement.  They\nhave asked for our help and direction. If we fail to participate, then we\nare partly to blame if future efforts fall short of the target. \n\n\n\n............................................................................\n.............................................. \nFlorida Guides Association \nAnnual Meeting and \nElection \nMarch  2 \n\n\n\nFlorida Guides Association announces its' annual meeting and election of\nDirectors and Officers on March 2 at the Florida State Fairgrounds in Tampa\nin conjunction with the Frank Sargeant Outdoor Expo. (Feb. 28 - March 2). \n\nAll Active Members who are willing to allocate a small but certain amount of\ntime and effort to FGA are strongly encouraged to submit their names for\nnomination to the FGA Board of Directors. FGA / BOD requirements include the\ncommitment to represent FGA in their individual locations, to inform FGA\nleadership of issues of concern to FGA membership, to solicit qualified\nGuides to join as Active Members, to participate in twice a year scheduled\nBoard of Director meetings and to offer their opinions and guidance as to\nthe future direction and activities of the Florida Guides Association. \n\nThose Active Members who have such an interest are encouraged to contact\nCapt.

I learned of a 14 year old boy from Taylor County that went to detention and will likey now go to a residential commitment program.  After months of family violence, where this boy witnessed his mother being beaten by his father, the Sheriff's Office responded to aid in one of the incidents.  The father became violent with the deputy, who had to restrain him on the ground and place him in handcuffs.  While the deputy was struggling with the father, the son was watching and distraught and ran up to the deputy and kicked him in the back begging him to \"get off his Daddy.\"  Of course the boy was charged with assaulting an officer, a serious offense.\n\n I learned of his story from his Juvenile Probation Officer.  This man stated that a year ago when there was a CINS/FINS counselor there in his office, he could have directly referred this family and many other like them, before the child became violent - when \"prevention\" was truly possible.  He said that when he did have that resource in the past, he never \"heard from those families again, but now they are all on his Probation caseload.\"\n\nThe majority of CINS/FINS counselors were cut last year - and now the cut in prevention is showing up in detention centers, commitment programs, kids being removed from their homes and kids on the street.\n\nPlease do what you can to support these needed services.\n\n"

I have been working with children for the last 12 years of my life. In those twelve years I have seen children that are often considered \"success stories\", the ones that after receiving prevention services were able to maintain healthy somewhat normal lives. These are the children that come back and visit our agency and lend their hearts and hands to help another. \n\nThen there are the stories that cause you to go home and hug your own children a little tighter. The stories that frighten us and make us wonder why, are often linked to a break in \"the chain\". A chain that, in the past, consisted of CINS/FINS services that aided children and their families in their quest for peace in troubled times.\n\nA great number of CINS/FINS counselors were cut last year and the cut is moving through the chain of service. The end result will be more sad stories and troubled times.\n\nMy plea is for you to support these services for they will ultimately support the future of our children.\n\nCrystal E.

If they have to take out a loan to cover those expenses, they no longer have the additional monies for child expenses.  Maybe you could allocate a portion of the DCF budget to reducing their  number of children being in foster care by increasing the number adopted each year.

What better person to teach\nhealth sciences in high school than a former employee of DOH,   what better\nperson to teach economics than a former state economist.  The program could\nbe set up as  a way to downsize government without the layoffs.   Since the\nstate is spending nearly 5000 or more to recruit teachers, why not give a\nbureaucrat who pledges to teach for 5 years, 3 months of their current\ngovernmental salary as a bonus.  The cost savings would be recognized in\nthe overall decrease in FTE's and salary.  For example, a state employee\nmaking $40,000 would get a check for $10,000.   The state would end up\nsaving the remaining $30,000 of their salary, plus the $5,000 that the\nstate already uses to recruit teachers, the state downsizes without\nlayoffs, and finally the state gets a 5 year guarantee for a teacher.\nTake Care.\n\nBarrett\n\n\nP.S.

Higginbottom's letter to the editor, by another lawyer. Thank you, Stuart D. Willson. Mr. Willson was apparently practicing law back when lawyers were interested in the good of the country, rather than lining their own pockets.\n\nOur worker-compensation insurance is nearly twice that of neighboring Georgia and Alabama because the lion's share of our premiums go to lawyers. Our doctors are leaving, and nursing homes and hospitals are going broke, even with their ridiculously high fees.\n\nWhile lawyers file more lawsuits, insurance goes up. When insurance goes up, hospitals and nursing homes must cut back on staff, nurses and doctors to survive. This, in turn, diminishes service and care, which invites more lawsuits. It's a never-ending cycle, which keeps getting worse.\n\nPeople don't seem to get alarmed when they see these huge settlements. Do they not realize each and every one of us pay for this indirectly? Several folks, who had never voted any way but Democratic, voted for Jeb Bush because they didn't want lawyer Bill McBride as governor and escalating the situation even more. We need to get behind our governor and demand tort reform.\n\nCertainly, all lawyers are not bad, but Mr. Higginbottom and his trial-lawyer friends are going to \"help\" us poor downtrodden citizens until we no longer have a doctor or hospital to go to. As one pundit put it, the trial lawyers are not satisfied to just shear the sheep -- they want to gut them too.\n\nMARVIN HAMMER\n\nBartow\n\n\n\n"

Currently, the Port of  Tampa's policy is not to solicit approved authorized trade with Cuba.  As you may be aware, there is increasing local pressure on the Port for not actively seeking permitted shipments to Cuba.  Several Florida agricultural interests have by-passed the Port for shipments to Cuba, and most recently one of our tenants arranged a shipment out of the Port of Manatee.  Understanding the political nature of this issue, I believe we should not prevent or be an obstacle to Florida agricultural interests in trading with Cuba that is allowed under current U.S. policy.  To maintain the current policy of the Port will only serve to inhibit the growth and development of the Port.\n \nPlease be apprised this afternoon John Thorington and I will be attending a public luncheon sponsored by La Gaceta, in attendance will be a Cuban official, whose name I do not know at this time.  \n \nI would appreciate your advice on these matters.

        "body": "Importance: High\n\n\nIn the last couple of days, I've been reading some very distressing news in relationship to our position on Sexual Predator laws and registration and house arrest, and wanted to bring up some of my concerns.\n \nFirst of all, Jeb, YOU of all people know what I had to go through to get that on the books in the first place.  And from my sources, I understand it was in miracle time too - only 2 years to accomplish something that ordinarily takes 4-6.  And don't get me wrong, I certainly understand \"case law\".  Law can NEVER BE so black and white that there are NO exceptions.\n \nHowever, in the above referenced titled story of the Court striking the Predator act in the Miami-Dade area, it states, that \"what we're asking for...is a hearing for a judge to determine whether a person is really dangerous\".\n \nSo since that story is on the heels of another regarding house arrest I meant to talk to you about anyway, let me illustrate why this is a bad idea...\n \nIn a former case of \"house arrest\" where I first got involved in starting my own organization there was this story.\n \nA Lake County Deputy was arrested for admittedly raping his 13-year old deaf step-daughter.  When I investigated this case further, I found out the reason house arrest was given, was because the guy had a very good lawyer, and typically child molesters and LEO's don't fare well in jail...but, that there were 6 other children in the home.  Training with law enforcement as I have done, there are different typologies of pedophiles, but this type certainly wouldn't be a good one to give house arrest to under these circumstances.  When I wrote the judge saying, basically, \"What were you thinking\" because no one will check in the middle of the night to see if he is violating anyone or not and that IS NOT SUPERVISION.  When I then brought in the cameras and media for his \"next decision\" on the case, he went to this...\"Okay, he'll wear an anklet device that will work in reverse\".  He will be required to leave the house when his wife goes to work and cannot return until she comes home.  So I asked the Probation people (very helpful btw), \"What's to stop him from picking up a 6 pack of beer at a convenience store and hanging out in playgrounds all day?\" Their reply...\"Nothing. He certainly could do that and we wouldn't know.\"\n \nOur judges are not properly trained in these affairs to know if someone is a danger or not. In fact, where there are one set of \"expert witnesses\" for the defense, they are an equal amount for the prosecution and usually prosecution cannot afford the same type of \"expert\" witnesses that a high expensive defense attorney can to even BEGIN to educate judges adequately...look at the OJ Simpson case for an example of that.\n \nModifications should be made to all things that stray from the unusual as necessary, but let's not throw out the baby with the bath water PLEASE.\n \n \n \n:) \nDiana Walley, GRI, ABR, e-PRO, RECS, REIS \nHomevest Realty \"Always just a call or click away\" \n(407) 832-0082 or askdiana@flash.net \n\nToll Free 1-888-876-5994 or home office: 407-856-9098\nwww.walleyworks.com or www.walleyworldrealestate.com \nLicensed Real Estate Professional for the State of Florida \n\n    \n\n"

        "body": "Cc: sos@3oaks.com\n\n\nDear Governor Bush:\n\nI am saddened to see Florida's water slowly being given up for sale to the benefit of outside entities. I was notified of the upcoming Springs Task Force Conference via email recently, and, upon reading it, noticed that two major sponsors are spring water bottlers, one of which has done well documented damages to national springs, not to mention having trampled upon the rights of local citizens (Wisconsin, Michigan, Texas, and Florida for starters). \n\nThe company I am referring to: Nestle, or as they call themselves now, Great Nestle Waters of America (AKA Perrier). This corporation has closed local springs long held dear to children and adults, as well as forced their way into areas of Florida and the USA against major public outcry by way of lawsuits, harassment, and promises of big dollars to those that would help them get a foot in the door.\n\nGovernor Bush, does not Florida's water, as one of your aides quoted to me two years ago, \"...belong to no one individual, but to everyone\"? And, if this company is to take our water, why are they not required to pay royalties to the State, as well as be closely monitored in their daily activities? My organization Save Our Springs has proven time and again that this company is dishonest and we have reported them at one spring on several occasions for having over pumped their daily allotment (and other atrocities); even during the height of the drought. \n\nSWFWMD is weak when it comes to handling this company, and ,is now, to appease their immense thirst, allowing them to truck in (a waste of energy) water from another source miles away, to dump into the river what the spring naturally would have been doing. All this so they could get a several hundred thousand gallon per day increase on their permit at Crystal Springs, which locals had prevented from happening for several years. Now they have it anyway. This is certainly one of the most preposterous, if not just laughable examples of government gone bad I have ever seen.\n\nHow can we, when knowing that conflict will develop over water in the future, allow a FOREIGN corporation so much control over local resources like fresh water? Doesn't the majority of the people of Florida have a say in this, and not those that would sell the very water out from under their feet? Bottled spring water is not a necessity for life, and certainly costs more per gallon than gasoline. Why are these companies only paying business taxes and such, and not paying the people of Florida for the immense wealth they are making from our aquifer? Couldn't they pay royalties and be required to finance water restoration and environmental programs for the water they take for free and sell right back to us?\n\nYes, I understand the argument that some of these companies are willing to buy up springshed land to \"protect it\". But, wouldn't it be more desirable to have American land be owned by Americans, at least when it comes to access to a precious natural resource like fresh water? When the earth is groaning with a burdensome future population, who will ultimately control our water? The good people of the state of Florida, or, a foreign corporation which is only concerned with it's own capital gain? \n\nThe rate of growth in my home state is already frightening, as well as the prospects of how overburdened natural resources will be able to support in the next twenty years.  I would think it wise that we as floridians consider guarding our resources carefully, as well as preserve as much natural land as possible. This should be the top priority over growth and new rooftops.\n\nYes, \"good, clean\" industry sounds good on paper and when spoken,  but at what cost is this industry of spring water bottling  operating in our state. I would humbly suggest you read the news around the country right now, Governor Bush. You might be surprised at how big this issue really is becoming. In fact the January 13 the issue of PEOPLE magazine features our President Terri Wolfe, and a lot of attention is given to Florida and springwater bottlers.\n\nPlease, Mr. Governor, consider what our DEP is condoning in the name of \"preservation\". Look into the damaging effects of borehole wells on our limestone aquifers. Finally, please realize that this company, Perrier, is NOT the good neighbor they claim to be, with their slick PR persons and \"scientific surveys\". They are shrewd business people with only one agenda. This agenda does not take our best interests into consideration.\n\nThank you for your time and thoughtful consideration.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBrad Willis\nVice President,  Save our Springs, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n"

As a registered voter in Broward County and a pollworker in the last two elections, I am deeply concerned about the frenzy of the media and other public officials in Broward County who refuse to indicate that only 3% of the polls opened late for the September primary election.  Additionally,when the budget was prepared no one, including the public officials who fund the Supervisor's budget or the County Budget Office that made substantial cuts in the Supervisor's proposed budget, anticipated the added expense of moving to a more sophisticated electronic voting system, and funded this expense at the appropriate level.\n\nAlthough a recent audit revealed some discrepancies in spending, the Supervisor of Elections has agreed to address those issues, including taking a reduction in pay.  Additionally, it appears that a double standard is being applied in Broward County.  Some years ago, another Constitutional Officer overspent his budget by more than $600,000 at the same time that law suits were pending against his office and him personally.  There was no call from public officials in Broward County for his suspension.  Additionally, County divisions routinely overspend their budgets, some annually by more than a million dollars, without incident.\n\nIs there a more vicious ulterior motive in wanting to replace Miriam Oliphant?  Earlier this year, the Charter Review Commission in Broward County attempted to have only the Supervisor's Office, of the three constitutional offices in Broward County, placed under the purview of the Broward County Commission and failed.  The citizens of Broward County believed that Ms. Oliphant was being targeted, not only because she is the only female elected constitutional officer, but because she is a minority.\n\nMs. Oliphant should be granted the opportunity to respond on January 25th to the issues outlined in your recent letter.  The continuation of allegations, innuendo, half-truths, etc. only detract from her ability to fulfill the duties for which the citizens of Broward County elected her to perform.\n\nMrs. S. M.

The Able Trust not only provides a vehicle for these agencys to create and fund endowments for the future of their agencys, but we also provide matching funds for this event. The gala is completely underwriten by Able Trust patrons,such as The George E. Batchelor Foundation, and therefore at zero cost to the participating agencys. It is our hope that you will be able to set aside this date on your unbelievably hectic calender to be with us. Thankyou for considering helping The Able Trust.

After reviewing all of the information, I still cannot support your conclusions about that 1992 Plan (Alternative 1) can achieve the goals of the Modified Water Deliveries Project. \n\n\n\nResponse: \n      I do not understand how you can make this statement if you read table 6 attached to the Chairman Cypress letter to Senator Inhofe which comes from the Corps SEIS on the 8.5 Square Mile Area.  The goal of the Modified Water Deliveries Project is to restore more natural flows to Shark River Slough to the extent practicable.  The Corps own SEIS chart (not ours) shows that Alternative 1 (the 1992 Plan) and Alternative 2b (the 1992 Plan modified for CREPE) meets this goal.  What facts do you have to the contrary? The EIS also shows that 6(d) has a red light for implementation and 1 and 2(b) have green lights. That is because condemning and forcibly removing people that don't want to leave their homes will take a very long time.  In fact, the controversy will only escalate.  The homeowners are already on Cuban radio and planning a march in little Havana next week. And, a major network is working on this poignant human interest story on their plight right now. \n\n      You may think that capitulating to political pressure is the best thing to do to jump-start Mod Waters and Everglades restoration.  I am telling you that it will only lead to MORE DELAY of a project that could be finished and restoring flows in six months to a year if the levee went up.  A project that would be restoring 900,000 acres of wetlands today if a bold leader would stand up and do the right thing.  I actually thought that leader would be you. \n\n      To me this is both a moral issue and an Everglades issue.  The EIS also says the Miccosukee Tribal Everglades loses eight tree islands a year because of the delay of Mod Waters.  These jewels of the Everglades, which are vital to the history and way of life of an Indian Tribe, are being lost forever.  It sounds to me that you believe that since the environmentalists held up Mod Waters for years trying to remove the entire community and could not, that you should now  support a plan that sacrifices 77 families for them even if it's not necessary for restoration. I simply do not understand this reasoning.  To me, it is reminiscent of throwing people to the lions to please the crowd. \n\n      I found it ironic the article about alleged property rights advocate Gail Norton's announcement that she favored condemning families in the 8.5 was right next to reservists being called to Iraq.  Those being called to war are the same kind of every day people who live in the 8.5 Square Mile Area.  They are not rich and powerful.  They are people who love this country and fight to protect it for democracy. What kind of  democracy is it when just because the tyranny of the majority calls for it, people are forcibly removed from their homes even if it isn't necessary?  Is ours a democracy that provides protection to people based on their wealth, privilege, and social status? I don't want to believe that. \n\n     One thing this battle has taught me is that minority communities with beekeepers, family farms and just plain old people like those in the 8.5 SMA are treated differently from the powerful and the rich.  I am certain that Gail Norton would not be calling for the removal of rich powerful ranchers out west.  Nor do I see her asking Dan Marino to move out of his home in Weston, which is blocking the flow of the Everglades, as opposed to the people of the 8.5 Square Mile Area which do not. \n\n      I have been a fact researcher for most of my life.  I found out that the only place that facts really mattered on the 8.5 SMA was before a federal judge who ruled that 6(d) was unlawful.  I must tell you, Governor Bush, that I believe that those advising you are either misinformed on the facts, or simply do not care about them.  I must also tell you that those on the Governing Board who advocated this plan and forced you into this unpalatable position of condemning Cuban exiles did you no favor.  In fact, what you are being asked to do is rescue the Corps from the Judge's decision on their unlawful plan and your appointments who came up with it in the first place. \nThe national press is not as starry eyed as the Florida reporters and may one day figure out that the state of Florida got federal taxpayers to pay nearly $60 million more dollars to condemn people and buy land that wasn't necessary for Everglades restoration. \n\n     I too am just a little person but I was always taught to speak truth to power. I continue to believe that if you are going to make decisions that destroy familles lives that you should visit the area, look them in the eyes, and tell them that they need to go for the sake of Everglades restoration.  It is much easier to make decisions that adversely affect people when you don't have to face the human impact of that decision.  I just don't see how you could go to the 8.5 SMA, talk to the residents over Cuban coffee and still feel the same way.  I urge you to at least look at the residents on the Miccosukee Magazine tape that was given to you.  It was Julio Concepcion, the beekeeper who escaped from Cuba twice and is on the tape, who caused me to change my mind and speak against this injustice at a public meeting when I was still with Friends of the Everglades. \n\n      What I said at that meeting in 1998 is that 6(d) is bad for human rights, bad for the Everglades and bad for democracy.   Five years later I still feel the same way.  Mark my words, if  6(d) is improperly passed through an Interior Appropriations Bill we will all lose.  So will the Everglades.  Most important, it will not be over.  There are still the courts, which appear to be the only place that still understand the word justice.   \n\n      God Bless You, \n\n     Joette \n"

I have known Ms. Guy for more than twenty five years and had the privilege of working with her in the past and the honor of being a personal friend.  While working for Verizon Communications for more than thirty years, Irene has continued to distinguish herself in both technical and managerial career paths.  Throughout her career at Verizon, she has been recognized by her employer as a top performer and continues to be assigned to positions of greater responsibilities.  In her present capacity as Director of External Affairs, Ms. Guy has been an active board member for public and private organizations within the Tampa Bay area and has been asked to hold numerous officer positions in these organizations due to her demonstrated leadership capabilities and the professional manner in which she conducts herself.\n \nWhile Ms. Guy has been involved with politics from her professional career, she has personally supported and been extremely active within the Republican Party.  She is very knowledgeable of political issues affecting Florida, Hillsborough County and the City of Tampa and has been active on numerous boards addressing these issues.  Her view is often sought due to her active involvement in addressing public issues and she has participated on televised political panels discussing these issues.\n \nMs. Guy is recognized as a partisan Republican and a vocal supporter of your administration and is well respected by both parties in the Hillsborough County area.  She is acknowledged as a very intelligent, focused individual who is fair in her assessment of issues and dealings with people.  She is an excellent communicator and a proven leader who has demonstrated a strong work ethic and a clear understanding of the use of technology.\n \nI cannot think of a more qualified candidate in Hillsborough County for this appointment and I personally believe that she would represent not only your office but the citizens of Hillsborough County, both Democrats and Republicans, in an exceptional fashion.  Ms. Guy's impeccable credentials and history of serving the citizens of Hillsborough County qualify her as an outstanding candidate for the Supervisor of Elections position.\n \nSincerely,\n \nLarry E. Williams\n  \n \n \n\n"

Many state programs will suffer cuts as lawmakers try to make our public ends meet.\n\nOne area where cuts cannot be afforded is the treatment of alcohol and drug use disorders.\n\nAlcohol and drug treatment is already underfunded to the point that five million Americans who need treatment cannot obtain it because the health care system simply lacks the capacity to care for them.\n\nWhy is addiction treatment so poorly funded?\n\nIndividuals with alcohol and drug use disorders are often viewed as a helpless cause, a waste of resources, or unworthy of care due to their own actions.\n\nNothing could be further from the truth.\n\nChemical dependency is a real and complex disease. The misuse of drugs or alcohol extends beyond mere choice. While the path to addiction begins with the act of drug consumption, a person's ability to choose not to take drugs can be compromised. Alcohol and drugs change brain chemistry and functioning and often lead to compulsive or uncontrollable use even in the face of extremely negative consequences. \n\nSubstance use disorders are more rightly seen as a brain disease, not a moral failure.\n\nThe good news is that alcohol and drug use disorders can be effectively treated. A study by the Physician Leadership on National Drug Policy concludes that alcohol and drug treatment is as effective as treatments for illnesses such as diabetes, asthma and hypertension.\n\nNot only is treatment medically effective, it is cost effective.\n\nFor every dollar spent on alcohol and drug treatment at least seven dollars is saved in terms of health care costs, increased productivity, and reduction in accidents. \n\nThe potential savings of treatment cannot be underestimated, when you consider that the annual social cost of alcohol and other drug disorders is over $300 billion.\n\nTreatment is also better and cheaper than prison. Offenders who receive treatment as part of their sentence have lower recidivism rates than their counterparts who receive no treatment.\n\nUnfortunately, the lack of funding for treatment is most notable in our state and federal prison systems. State officials report that 70 to 85 percent of inmates need some type of substance use disorder treatment, but less than 15 percent actually receive treatment.\n\nAs a result, we see a revolving door for people who commit crimes either on drugs or for drugs or both. Incarceration without treatment does not address addiction, it merely interrupts the cycle.\n\nAnd how does the cost of treatment compare to incarceration?\n\nIntensive inpatient alcohol or drug treatment costs roughly half of what it costs to imprison a person. And yet funding still lags.\n\nBut treatment is not only elusive for those who cannot afford insurance and those behind bars. Fully employed Americans who think they have comprehensive health care coverage also have trouble obtaining alcohol and drug treatment.\n\nSome insurance companies offer limited or restricted alcohol and drug treatment coverage.\n\nThere are often higher co-payments and deductibles for alcohol and drug treatment. There are more stringent limits on inpatient care and outpatient treatment for addiction than for other diseases. Also, the annual and lifetime expenditure caps are more restrictive for substance use disorders than for other diseases.\n\nIn short, patients in need of alcohol and drug treatment are discriminated against based on their disease.\n\nGiven the social cost of substance use disorders and existence of effective treatment, the above facts and figures are unacceptable.\n\nState legislatures should strengthen funding for alcohol and drug treatment and approve parity legislation that ensures equal health care coverage for all diseases. Our nation's long-term health and economic well-being depend on it.\n\nUnfortunately, health and social service programs, including alcohol and drug treatment, are among the first cut in times of fiscal crisis. The tragic irony is that these services are most needed when the economy is slumping. An uncertain economic future means fewer jobs, less secure health coverage, and increased alcohol and drug use.\n\nRepresenting the nation's frontline addictions counselors, I encourage legislators to shield alcohol and drug treatment from budget cuts. Treatment is a wise investment that yields healthier and more productive citizens.\n\n\nPat Ford-Roegner is executive director of NAADAC, The  <http://www.naadac.org/> Association for Addiction Professionals.\n\n\n"

Secretary of Health Dr. John Agwunobi said the challenge could be met.  Mass vaccination would be the surest way to slow an outbreak, according to some experts.\n\nWe believe we have the tool/antidote/vaccine to strengthen all Florida families in our Family Table Time kit.  A future headline could read, \"Florida Develops Plan for Mass Training to Strengthen Families.\"  All parent, children and caregivers would be eligible for the training.  Mass training in the Family Table Time process or eating dinner together regularly would be the surest way to slow an outbreak of divorce, abuse (child, parent, and drug), births out of wedlock just to name a few.  We can build tables for those families that needs one. \n\nThe one problem in the mass vaccination of smallpox is that up to 30 percent of the US population may be ineligible for the vaccine whereas everybody could participate in the Family Table Time training process.\n\nHere is an article that is going out to the corporate world both nationally and internationally.   We really like the way it reads and explains our Family Table Time tool.   This is just one avenue we are pursuing.   \n\nHere's to \"the tipping point\" for strengthening the Florida family.  To be continued.\n\nNeal Kimball and family \n\n"

That means in just a few short years this part of the county will hold the key for future county wide elections. With 3 generations of ties in this community I believe I am the right person for the future.\n \n    Most of the candidates seeking this position have previously served the public with several of them not being re-elected and others failing to win an election. I believe I have a wide range of support in Hillsborough County and throughout the state. I have met your new Deputy Chief of Staff, Alan Levine and even though we do not know one another very well, Mr. Levine's assistant administrator Charlie Darcy serves as president of the chamber and I believe Mr. Levine can give you a little insight into my character.\n \n    I am humbled by the people who have come to me and offered their support.

In St. Pete, for some time we have had a \"St. Pete Reads\" program where the city does various things, including providing volunteers and opening up Recreation Centers at night for tutors who help children learn to read.  Other cities may do similar things and it may be good to expand the Municipal initiative to a \"Mentoring and Literacy\" initiative.  Frankly, I think the two overlap considerably and it may be good to merge them.\n \n2.  In the Literacy program it may be effective to do a \"Governor's Reading Fitness Award\" similar to the \"President's Physical Fitness Award\" started by Kennedy.  Like the Physical Fitness Award, there would be a series of accomplishments (specified books; literary areas; quantity of books; or others) which, if completed, the student receives the award.  Your comments about the student who reads hundreds of pages a day made me think of it.  If he were a great athlete there would be lots of honors but how do we recognize our great readers?\n \n3.  On February 14th I will be announcing my first nine corporate middle school partners in St. Pete.  Upon launching we will have all nine middle schools in the city matched with a corporate partner.  The commitment of the Corporation is to work with the school to help it improve, and to meet at least each semester with the principal to look for new ways to help and to see how the school is doing.  The city's role is to arrange the meetings each semester; to install plaques at the schools identifying the partnership; to provide the corporation with the FCAT scores for the schools compared to others in the county; and to provide the corporation with updated lists of what other corporate partners are doing - examples include providing mentors and tutors; serving as principal for a day; providing computers, art supplies, etc;  hosting educator awards; and others.  The partnership continues until either the school or corporation decide it is no longer working.  Once we get the middle school program up and running I intend to expand to High School and Elem.\n\nKeep up the great work!\n \nRick\n\n"

He was finally placed on Wednesday, January 15 at about 2:00PM.  The reason for our hurry, besides the obvious reasons of having him with us permanently, was that back in December when the DCF caseworker went to give Judge Thorpe an update on our child's case, Judge Thorpe apparently became upset that after all this time he still hadn't been placed with us.  At that time (DEC 3.2002) she signed a court order stating that we needed to have him with us for overnights and weekends until all was complete.  At that time she also scheduled the finalization hearing for April 16, 2003.  If Nicholas had not been finally placed with us by this week (Wednesday at the latest) we wouldn't have met the legal requirements that he needed to be in our home for 90 days before the judge could finalize the adoption.  There would have had to have been another meeting with the judge in order to explain why the deadline wasn't met and also to schedule another finalization hearing at a later date.  As a result of the election year, and redistricting of judges we now have a new judge on the case and it was beginning to become apparent that the DCF was not as pressed to get things done.  As a matter of fact the things they were coming up with to stall the process in the final days were bordering on lunacy.\nIn the end, we now have our son and \"all's well that ends well\" as they say.  We have requested a letter from the DCF that officially states the date of placement and also the date of the hearing for finalization.  A letter which they apparently do not customarily provide adoptive parents with.  They have agreed to send us this and we should receive it sometime this coming week.  We are not sure if you want us to brief you on our whole experience or not.  If so, please let us know and we would be happy to email you all of our notes on our case from day one.\nPlease be assured of our prayers for you and all of your family.  We are truly grateful to have someone like you leading our state.\nSincerely,\nRoland and Annette Cayer\n10639 Demilo Place #105\nOrlando, FL 32836\n(407)238-5387   \nPS Attached please find a picture of Nicholas Dominic.

While I think we were satisfied with the proposed matrix rate for res hab. services, we all seem to have a problem with the single rate structure for PCA as it relates to the Res hab matrix rate.  The proposed rate seems to encourage group home placement.   Like Charm, I am disappointed that, even though we have repeatedly addressed the need for a PCA rate that considers the challenging needs of those that have the needs that you described, our suggestions have been ignored.  While this may not have been intentional, we are disappointed that it has happened.  \n \nCould it be possible for Mercer to develop a proposed rate structure in a stepped and matrix format for PCA, and other services such as Companion, ADT, Supported Employment...? The matrix format, even though more complex, seems more equitable and fair. \n \nI would also like to make a few comments on the  proposed ADT rate. The Mercer proposed daily rate (see attachment), calculated for 250 days per year, as we were told it was going to be, seems to constitute an increased rate from the current rates.  See attached District 10 Oct. 2002 ADT rates.   Note that with the exception of one provider (a faith based provider) that bills for 230 days, the remainder bill for 170 days and not 250.   This method of billing for less days than the contracted service days has always been an issue of concern for many of us.  I recall some providers billing for the 170 days up-front, which when/if an individual changed provider, the funding was sometimes either not sufficient to cover the cost of the new provider for the remainder of the cost plan year, or it was completely spent.  Some WSC had to request additional funding to cover for the service with the new provider.   On the current rates, note that with the exception of two individual rates of $11,820.10 (for 3 hrs. per day) and $26,191.90 (6 hrs per day), the ADT rates in my district fluctuate from $3,957.00 to $8,037.00 per year.  The majority of the rates are on the range of $5,000.00 to $6,000.00 per year.  Why, then, are we proposing a new rate range of $9,000.00 to $10,000.00 and $25,000.00 for individual rates?  This without any consideration to the number of service hrs. per day.  A matrix rate for this service should be explored.  \n \nOn the other hand, the proposed supported employment rate is a simple rate, which even though it may appear higher due to the per hourly rate instead of daily rate, it doesn't take into consideration the needs of those individuals that may need a more intense service due to the intensity of their challenging issues.   The proposed rate structure among ADT and supportive employment also seems to favor ADT, specially as it relates to individuals with more significant challenges.\n \nI understand the Redesign team will be meeting before the end of the month.  I do not know when is the meeting scheduled for, but if at all possible, I will appreciate if it can be on 1/27.  With the exception of this coming Monday and Tuesday, the only other day this month that I do not have an out of town scheduled meeting is next Monday 1/27/03.  For a conference call, I am available this coming Tuesday or any day in the weekend.  Please let me know.\n \nBerthy\n========\n\nOn Sat, 18 Jan 2003 14:13:27 -0500 \"Brantley, Michelle K.\" <brantlem@fdhc.state.fl.us> writes:\nHi Charm,\n \nWe can make arrangements to set aside a couple hours for families and\nconsumers before the entire stakeholder group meets on the 28th. We realize\nthat families and consumers have multiple demands and hectic schedules so we\ncan hopefully accomodate more people if we do everything on the same day or\nthe day before. \n \nIn regards to the tiered rate model, this would not require a new rule\nmaking process. We could incorporate this as part of the proposed rate\nstructure. In other words, we can make changes based on public input, such\nas yours, before we promulgate the final rate structure into rule. \n \nThank you all for your unflagging determination and  commitment to the\nprogram redesign.

Berthy expressed\nsimilar concerns after the meeting and we have asked Mercer to develop some\nalternatives. I have suggested that Mercer develop a tiered model similar to\nNorth Carolina's Medicaid state plan PCA service. The model basically\ndescribes and reimburses 3 different levels of PCA services based on the\nindividual's need, abilities and limitations. Each level is described by the\nintensity of PCA services needed.\n \nDue to boarder nursing delegation laws in NC, Florida would need a model\nwhich excludes any skilled PCA care unauthorized by FL's nurse practice act.\nWe need a model which compensates based on the level of assistance needed\nfor daily living activities such as bathing, feeding, bowel and bladder care\nand physical activity (especially heavy lifting and transfers) as well as\nbehavioral management. The PCA's ability and willingness to perform such\nactivities is rarely attributed to a formal professional competency level\n(such as certification as a nursing assistance), but rather the PCA's\n\"hands-on \" work experience, willingness to learn and receive parent\ntraining, physical abilities, behavioral management skills and overall\nunderstanding of  the individual with developmental disabilities.  \n \nI have attached a weblink to the NC personal care manual for some IDEAS\nONLY, but we can simplify the model for purposes of reimbursement. Again,\nthe intent is to describe PCA in a manner which compensates for different\nlevels of need/intensity of care.\nhttp://www.dhhs.state.nc.us/dma/mp/mpindex.htm \n \nIn an effort to ensure family and self advocates have ample time to express\nany concerns or share ideas relating to single rates, perhaps we should\nconsider a separate conference call with just families and consumers prior\nto the next meeting and/or set aside an hour or 2 before the stakeholder\nmeeting for this purpose. \n \nShelly  \n \n-----Original Message-----\n"

You have assured\nall of us, repeatedly, that you are very much aware of that concern and that\nit will be addressed.  As far as I can see it has not been addressed.  I\nfeel like I have been ignored.  So, once again I am reminding you that it is\nvery important that a higher rate for individuals with significant needs be\nidentified.\n \nWithout these changes you will NOT be supporting the development of \"in home\nsupports\", as you claim, but encouraging congregate and institutional living\nsituations for individuals with significant needs and discouraging the\ninvolvement and contributions of families and community.\n \nWhat exactly is the higher rate you propose to pay providers who will\nprovide in home support services to consumers who have higher complex needs?\n \nHave a great weekend.\n \nSincerely,\n \nCharm  Thometz\n"

Ahora, ?que pasara?\", pregunto Evelyn Rivera, la presidenta del Concejo de Liderazgo de Padres de Florida.\n\nFue despedido en diciembre pasado durante una reunion en Tallahassee tocante a los fallos en los programas bilinguees en las escuelas de Orange.\n\n\"Me vinieron a buscar durante la reunion y me dijeron que no regresara. Alli mismo me despidieron sin razon\", dijo Garcia.\n\nEducacion no devolvio llamadas a El Sentinel.\n\nSu despedida no ha sido el unico cambio en Educacion. Tambien despidieron a 64 administradores como parte de una reorganizacion.\n\nEn 1998 los electores votaron para que la Junta de Directores de Educacion sean nombrados por el gobernador y no elegidos por los votantes. Ahora, Educacion esta completamente bajo el control del gobernador Jeb Bush.\n\nGarcia vigilaba como los distritos escolares realizaban sus programas bilinguees, que es de gran importancia ya que, segun un informe anual sobre la educacion de las minorias en las escuelas publicado esta semana por Education Week, los estados buscan satisfacer un area o programa especifico, pero no le dan seguimiento para determinar su efectividad.\n\nEn Orange, los resultados de las investigaciones de los programas bilinguees despertaron interes publico donde antes no existia.\n\n\"Espero que alguien continue los esfuerzos en la administracion de estos programas\", dijo Gloria Esteban, del Consejo de Asesoria Hispana de Orange.\n\nAlgunos padres latinos piensan que los cambios a nivel estatal provocaran consecuencias en Orange.\n\nCarmen Sotolongo, madre de una estudiante que asiste a la escuela intermedia Stonewall Jackson, dijo que a traves de las auditorias y sus numerosas presentaciones frente a la Junta Escolar del Condado de Orange, Garcia demostro las deficiencias en las escuelas publicas.\n\n\"Estos problemas son graves y los padres necesitan saber lo que esta pasando. Sin alguien como [Garcia] dirigiendo este movimiento, nos quedaremos en la oscuridad\", dijo Sotolongo.\n\nAhora, el futuro de los programas bilinguees esta en el limbo.\n\nSegun Joan First, la directora de la Coalicion Nacional de Defensores de Estudiantes, en Boston, Garcia fomentaba \"fe en las escuelas publicas de Florida, orgullo familiar y la esperanza de un futuro mejor\".\n\n\"Algunas personas me llaman por telefono y me cuentan que estan desilusionadas. El siempre demostro su obligacion a estas personas y sus hijos y ahora ellos no saben que pasara\", dijo First.\n\nEste articulo incluye reportes de agencias noticiosas.

Last week city residents\nobjected to former mayor Arnold Lanner being the\nrecipient of the city's inaugural Martin Luther King,\nJr Humanitarian Award. Among other things, while\nsitting on the commission, Lanner once referred to the\npredominently black northwest area as a \"rat hole.\"\n\nWasserman-Rubin, whose district includes portions of\nHallandale, Hollywood and the Carver Ranches area, led\na failed attempt to have Gov. Jeb Bush oust Broward\nCounty Supervisor of Elections Miriam Oliphant this\nweek. This raised the ire of the black electorate and\nnow, it appears it may be Wasserman-Rubin who is\nousted as a result her stand against Oliphant. \n\n\"On behalf of the MLK day, I did not want the event to\nbe downtrodden and the dream forgotten,\" said Rev.\nJosh Brown, a Hallandale community activist and\nchairman of the city's King Day committee. Brown\nacknowledged he had heard from residents and members\nof the Broward Ministerial Alliance, which is a\ncoalition of black pastors representing several\nchurches, who have objected to Wasserman-Rubin's\nparticipation or attendance at the celebrations.\n\nLast week, another popular black minister, Bishop\nVictor Curry, said on his radio talk show that if\nWasserman-Rubin attends this, or any other black\noriented events in the south county area, he and his\ncongregations would withdraw their participation and\nsupport from such events.\n\nThe Broward Ministerial Alliance has reportedly\ninformed city officials they would resort to protests\nof Hallandale's day of events if Wasserman-Rubin is\nnot barred from participating in those festivities.\n\"I've expressed my concerns to all parties and I am\nwaiting for an answer,\" stated Rev. Brown when asked\nif he had asked Wasserman-Rubin to withdraw herself as\nGrand Marshall.\n\nBrown said, as chairman of the King Day Committee, he\nsimply forwarded the concerns that were brought to his\nattention to city officials and would not express a\npersonal position on the controversy. He did say there\nhave been preliminary discussions to have black city\nresident John Saunders replace Wasserman-Rubin as\nGrand Marshall. Saunders was the first and only black\never elected to office in Hallandale. The Broward\nTimes is continuing it's attempts to reach\nWasserman-Rubin for comment. \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo! Mail Plus - Powerful. Affordable.

The people that I observed needed to have someone instruct them on the use of the equipment or at least have instructions available to follow directions.

Tom Waltz, our local dcf licensing person was there, but no one from Lakeview ever showed up---perhaps they got caught in a snowstorm between Fort Walton and Pensacola  and their cell phones died.

I know you are wondering if rose is involved and the answer is no, hell no-it would never get finished!!!.. she doesn't even know anything about it and neither does COPE . We don't' want any of rose's or COPE'S input or interference-this is going to be a model for the state to follow if I have anything to do with it  Did I tell you that Lakeview-Baptist hospital had a training and information session for all of the foster parents from okaloosa-walton county on Thursday, January 9 at OWCC?? Most of the foster parents got a letter with the agenda, etc and if we had any questions, concerns, etc. their team would stand at the ready to clarify anything and everything. A few foster parents did not get the letter because not everyone is in their database yet???? Lakeview, as you may recall, is the agency that won the bid to run the dcf  under its privatization on November 1, 2002 and everyone isn't in the database yet, hence not everyone got the letter??? We are not talking about gazillions  of entries for only four counties and they already have many of escambia and santa rosa foster chiildren as clients!..now for the kicker...approximately 41 foster parents and a few dcf personnel attended and were waiting and waiting and LAKEVIEW NEVER DID SHOW UP THE ENTIRE NIGHT and THEY  called the meeting and even sent out letters!!! Lakeview is the newly-privatized head of the department of children and families.  I think that the governor needs to hear about this. I want to take the lakeview invitation letter and send it to him and write right across the top that the seminar presenters did not even show up nor did they call nor did they send correspondence of any type.  About a week ago on TV, Jeb said that he was so pleased with how the privatization is going and is looking forward to when Medicaid and food stamps are privatized.  Someone needs to tell him that privatization is for profit and not for children-no one wants to seem to want to make waves. These  are innocent children and foster parents that are trying to give the children their \"fifteen minutes of fame\" as the saying goes. Walton county needs this type of home and if it is at all possible, I want to be part of the group to make it happen as soon as possible!!!! Thank you in advance for your support....sally\n \n-----Original Message-----\n"

        "body": "\nNOW how do you feel about your adoption law?\n\n--------------------\nFlorida's abortion rate is rising; almost half the procedures are in S. Florida \n--------------------\n\nBy Nancy McVicar\nHealth Writer\n\nJanuary 20, 2003\n\nAs the 30th anniversary of legal abortion approaches, abortion rates nationwide have declined to their lowest levels since 1974. But in Florida, the rate is rising, and Broward, Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties account for almost half the abortions performed in the state.\n\nSeveral factors could be contributing to the increase, said Donna Barber, executive director of the Florida Association of Planned Parenthood Affiliates in Tallahassee.\n\n\"It could be that abortion clinics are more accessible, or it could be because the state family planning budget has decreased and not as many women are getting family planning help,\" Barber said.\n\n\"Last year, a million and a half dollars was taken out of the state's family planning program and moved to the abstinence program,\" she said. \"The budget wasn't big enough to start with, only serving about 26 percent of the women in need in the state. It would be nice if people practiced abstinence, but I don't know how you stop people from having sex.\"\n\nBarber said the women most in need of help are not getting information about birth control methods, especially women working in low-paying jobs without health insurance or family doctors.\n\nBill Parizek, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Health, said no one at the department tracks abortions, except to gather data for its Vital Statistics reports on births and deaths, but that access to family planning services has not been cut.\n\n\"I know we have $7.1 million in family planning and $5.7 million in abstinence programs,\" Parizek said. \"There's been no changes to pregnancy prevention access in many years.\"\n\nAccording to a report issued on Wednesday by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, the national abortion rate has dropped to 21.3 abortions per every 1,000 women, the lowest rate since 1974. But in 2000, the most recent year for which statistics have been compiled, the rate in Florida was 31.9 per 1,000, up from 29 in 1995.\n\nParizek said the state does not ask for residency information, so it is possible people are coming to Florida from states with tougher abortion regulations, which could skew the state's abortion rate.\n\nThe Guttmacher Institute, with offices in Washington, D.C., and New York, is a nonprofit organization for sexual and reproductive health research, and its reports are frequently quoted by both sides of the abortion debate.\n\nThe institute's study showed how prevalent abortion is in America today.\n\nOf the almost 6.3 million pregnancies each year in the United States, 48 percent were unintended, according to the report. Almost half of those, 47 percent, ended in abortion.\n\nThe most frequent reasons women give for seeking abortions is that they can't afford to care for a child -- 21 percent. Another 21 percent say they aren't ready for the responsibility, the report said.\n\nJoyce Tarnow, who runs the Women's Clinic in Lauderhill, which has offered abortions for 25 years, said most of the women who need the clinic's services are not practicing birth control.\n\n\"Most people weren't using a contraceptive method when they got pregnant, or they'll say they were on the pill, but ran out,\" Tarnow said. \"They're not keeping menstrual calendars.\"\n\nShe said the majority of women seeking abortions aren't teenagers and won't be swayed by arguments about abstinence as a means of preventing pregnancy.\n\n\"Our patient population is mostly from the early 20s up and as late as 45-48,\" she said. \"We have seen kids as young as 11, but we don't have very many teenagers. We've never seen a lot of teenagers.\"\n\nMore abortion clinics\n\nWhile some states have had a reduction in the number of abortion clinics and physicians who will perform the procedure, Florida has had an increase -- 68 licensed abortion clinics, the highest number since 1990, and at least another 40 physicians and hospitals that offer abortion services.\n\nThe Guttmacher survey found that 103,050 abortions were performed in Florida in 2000, with 108 physicians or clinics offering abortion services.\n\nThe Florida Agency for Health Care Administration, which licenses abortion clinics, reported 85,589 pregnancies terminated at Florida abortion clinics in 2001. Almost half -- 41,925 -- were in three South Florida counties.\n\nMiami-Dade County had 22,272 abortions, Broward County had 13,193, and Palm Beach County had 6,460, according to state health officials.\n\nUnlike the Guttmacher survey, AHCA's numbers do not include private physicians who offer abortion procedures.\n\nA bill pre-filed for the 2003 Legislature by Sen. Anna P. Cowin, R-Leesburg, would allow the state to write regulations that must be followed by abortion clinics.\n\n\"They're not held to the same standards as ambulatory surgery centers or in-office surgeries,\" Cowin said on Friday.\n\nCowin said she opposes abortion, but her reason for introducing the bill is to hold abortion clinics to the same standards as other places performing similar procedures.\n\n\"I'm not trying to do anything that would be more restrictive,\" Cowin said. \"I just think we should be more protective of our women.\"\n\nClinic operators said new regulations are unnecessary and could add costs that would drive some out of business or force them to charge more for the procedures.\n\n\"It's called the Women's Health and Safety Act, and it sounds pretty innocuous,\" said Carolyn Pardue, a lobbyist for Planned Parenthood in Florida. \"But they're not trying to make it safer for women, they're trying to make it harder for women. They're trying to regulate clinics out of business.\"\n\nMona Reis, president of Presidential Women's Center in West Palm Beach, said the clinics already are licensed and regulated and that the procedure is very safe.\n\n\"This is very frightening. Most people sitting in the Florida Legislature have no idea how outstanding the care is, and they're going to be misled by this misconception of what abortion facilities are like,\" Reis said. \"This strategy has been used across the country to create burdensome, unnecessary regulations with the motivation to close down abortion facilities.\"\n\nThe Abortion Pill\n\nWith approval of the abortion pill by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in September 2000, and availability of the drug, Mifeprex, later that year, a growing number of women are opting to use it rather than the surgical method to end pregnancies.\n\nVicki Saporta, president of the National Abortion Federation, said 75 percent of the organization's members are offering the abortion pill.\n\n\"At about 30 percent of our sites, as many as a third of women are choosing to have a medical abortion,\" Saporta said. She did not have specific numbers for Florida.\n\nDanco Laboratories, the company that makes the pill called Mifeprex, said this week that more than 130,000 U.S. women have used the \"early-option\" pill to date.\n\nSaporta said if abortion were to be banned in the United States, the pill would not be an option, though doctors might still have access to it for other uses.\n\n\"The majority of people in this country still are firmly pro-choice and do not think the government should be making these decisions,\" Saporta said. \"There is no mandate to turn back reproductive rights because women's health and lives would be in jeopardy.\"\n\nYet women's health advocates say they are worried.\n\n\"It's war on women,\" said Mary Capobianco, president of Planned Parenthood of South Palm Beach and Broward Counties. \"The personal belief systems of the president and the governor are interfering with what the general public wants.\"\n\nBarbara Herring, of the Pro-Choice Coalition of Broward County, helped plan a Roe v. Wade 30th anniversary observance for Wednesday evening in Fort Lauderdale's Huizenga Plaza, at Andrews Avenue and Las Olas Boulevard. Herring said the program is aimed at educating young people about what happened before Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court case that made abortion legal.\n\nHerring worked as a nurse in maternity wards in Massachusetts in the 1960s when birth control was illegal.\n\n\"Doctors were not allowed to give diaphragms or birth control pills because of something called the Comstock Law. I was a maternity supervisor, and sometimes it was very sad seeing people who didn't really want to have children because they couldn't afford to, or children born severely deformed, who didn't survive. But the woman had to endure the pregnancy and go through that. I would never want to see us go back to that,\" she said.\n\nNancy McVicar can be reached at nmcvicar@sun-sentinel.com or 954-356-4593. \n\nCopyright (c) 2003, South Florida Sun-Sentinel \n\nVisit Sun-Sentinel.com\n"

Our prisons have become nothing more than human holding cells housing oppressed people, serving extended time, without any means of correction or redemption.\n\nBeing a prisoner in Florida means being hungry.  In the name of efficiency the state has given the contract to a company offering food for pennies a day.  I had an inmate write that said the meat served just covered the bowl of his teaspoon.  He was given the choice to eat it or not.\n\nIt means shivering in the cold.  The DOC does not have enough warm clothing or bedding to issue this winter.  A deficiency of long johns, of underwear, of warm sox, or lined jackets means being chilled to the bone.  \n\nBeing in Florida's prison system means having a greatly diminished future. Inmates have little opportunity to learn a trade or a job skill since most of our prison programs have been cut in the name of efficiency.\n\nIt might mean a toothache because the dental care is backlogged from six months to a year.\n\nIt could mean that medical treatment is withheld, as in the case of my son, delayed until it was too late to operate.\n\nIt means living in a hostile environment because the officers and guards are low paid, under trained, and emotionally stressed.  Being an inmate in Florida means being personally degraded, dehumanized, and threatened by DOC staff with an absolute power that runs unchecked and unquestioned.  \n\nSafety or security only pertains to Correctional officers and staff, concern for safety doesn't include inmates.  Inmates can be raped, or beaten, or gassed, or set up for false charges, and no one in Florida's administration cares.\n\nContrary to the present philosophy of Florida, statistics show that the opportunities for rehabilitation, and how an offender is treated while incarcerated, makes more of a difference to recidivism than length of sentence.  Education, vocational and drug programs are shown to decrease the likelihood of return to prison.  \n\nFlorida continues to in-force serving longer sentences, with less and less rehabilitation.  This has not been effective here, or in other states.  We need to make changes.\n\n\nMarlene Nolte-Director\n4907 Coral Blvd.\nBradenton, FL 34210\n(941) 794-0197\nhttp://www.starcoast-academy.com/\nStarCoast-a distance learning Academy, Inc.\na not for profit organization\n"

Destroying the state's development watchdog serves only to raise fears about the state's future.\"\nCOMMENT: It seems that some people still don't get.  You just don't care!\n=============================================================\nJeb Is Making Big Mistake Undercutting Growth Controls\n\nTampa Tribune Editorial\nPublished: Jan 19, 2003 \n\nGov. Jeb Bush has initiated a restructuring of the state's growth management system that seems certain to undermine Florida's ability to control growth. \nThe governor wants to merge the Department of Community Affairs, the state's growth agency, into the secretary of state's office. \nIt's a bewildering effort, one that the governor failed to discuss during his re- election campaign. That is no surprise. Voters likely would have been suspicious of a plan that appears designed to diminish controls on the irresponsible development that ultimately forces citizens to pay heavy costs - either in additional taxes or in a lower quality of life. \nThe two agencies have nothing in common. The secretary of state's office oversees elections and cultural and historical events and registers businesses. The Department of Community Affairs coordinates local growth plans and emergency preparedness. \nTo contend, as the Bush administration does, that the departments should be wedded because they both deal with communities is insulting. The same can be said of just about every state agency. \nWhat's more, throwing these two disparate efforts together could result in a cumbersome, unresponsive bureaucracy in which the state's planning responsibilities would be all but lost. \nThe whole scheme is unsettling and revives questions about Bush's commitment to managing growth. In his first race for governor, the former developer seemed unenthusiastic about Florida's growth management laws. But after losing that election and spending the next few years traveling the state to observe its needs, Bush seemed to moderate his views. He acknowledged the necessity of regulations to keep construction from ruining resources and overwhelming infrastructure. But, characteristic of politicians who want to minimize government, he thought the growth management process should be streamlined - a reasonable position. \nAnd Bush has consistently held that the state should focus on major growth impacts and leave minor matters strictly to local officials. While this seems sensible, neighborhood groups and conservationists fear the governor would retreat from all growth decisions except for a few high-profile cases. Bush says that is not his intent. But his dismantling of Community Affairs is not reassuring. \nFlorida's history shows that some state oversight is essential. Local governments are to blame for most of Florida's countless planning disasters, including the smothering of the Florida Keys, the dangerous overdevelopment of barrier islands, and the siting of a cement plant near Ichetucknee Springs State Park. \nThe Danger Of Corruption \nWith influential interests promising jobs and other immediate benefits, local officials often ignore a project's long- term consequences. And sometimes corruption is at work, as longtime Hillsborough residents well know. In the 1980s, several county commissioners on the take made decisions that forever changed the county's landscape. \nState involvement provides safeguards against such abuse. \nThe governor may be correct that the growth management process needs to be revamped to eliminate excessive red tape. Other changes may also be justified. But eliminating the Department of Community Affairs is a terrible mistake. Destroying the state's development watchdog serves only to raise fears about the state's future.\n\n"

I appreciated meeting Teresa Tinker, Barbara Hoagland and Sherri Joyner from your office.\n \nI also met with Commissioner Horne on January 9th and shared some thoughts about where we have been in PreK in Forida and where we are planning to go to prepare children for literacy skills and the \"No Child Left Behind\" initiative. \n \nMany people have asked how public schools are providing Prek programs. I wanted to share this email with you . \n \nCarol Barnett has been instrumental in Polk County and in the state and nation on the Success by 6 \ncore values. We support you on your literacy and reading initiatives. Please call on me if you would like for me explain our program. You are always invited to come to Polk County and see school readiness in action!\n \nNanette Rodgers\nSupervisor Child care Services/ PreK\nPolk County Schools\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\nDear Commissioner Horne, \nSince we met on 1/9, several things have come up that I want to share with you, as you plan for PreK transition next year. I know you are busy, so I will try to be brief!  I  hope you can read the last CLIP Teaching tykes. In case you can't access it from my email, Alex Amengual, Partnership Staff, can send it to you. alex.amengual@school readiness.org \nThis recertification of  Prek children is happening statewide to the PreK school district school sites and our contracted child care center sites. As you and I discussed,  the Polk School District and other school districts believe in contracting out to private child care centers up to 50% of the spaces for the Prek children. Before you read about recertification, I need to share a question that some have asked  about the value of contracting with school districts. \n \nSherri Joyner from the Governor's office asked me to email her why I think school districts are  the agency to contract out  PreK, not only to school sites but to contracted child care sites. I shared the following:\n\"Quality Initiatives\" are the key. When F.S.230  was initiated, Polk School District  contracted out 42% of the Prek program and since F.S. 411, we continue to contract. After all, the children will be coming to kindergarten next year and this is a collaboration among all providers. A  few examples we offer to our contracted sites  in Polk: \n1.The public schools can offer a free hot lunch every day from an area cafeteria. \n2.We provide \"take home libraries\". We give each child 5 books to keep so parents can read to their children, at home. This is the literacy component and \"No child Left Behind\" mindset.\n3.We provide a registered nurse to each contracted child care prek site and school site. Polk has 56  Prek sites. Each nurse, through a  prek school readiness fund contract with the Polk Health Department, oversees 7 sites each. \n...I will be glad to discuss more quality initiatives that school districts provide, if I can help explain further.\n The reason I share \"quality initiatives\" is I think many people who don't deal with this every day, do not realize how valuable the school districts have been and continue to be in school readiness. We see the value of literacy and we can offer training, workshops and seminars to all providers, whether they contract with us or not.  I am interested in contracting for 4 year olds at the school district. Our Superintendent Jim Thormhill and our Polk County School Board support us in this effort. Other agencies are highly qualified to provide early education and care to children 0-4 and school-age. \n \n The following is my report from the field!  ; }\n Nanette Rodgers\n\n \nThis email  is from our FYA Central agency Director, Juanita Tomson, who has to send out the letters to POLK school board prek parents(because we have to be subsidized brokers of care now) every 6 months.\n\n \nThis CLIP below :  number 4  TEACHING  TYKES  has  letters sent out every three months. Some 4 C's  are sending recertification letters out once a year(Pam Davis, BIG Ben 4C sends out once a year).\n \nSOMEONE HAS TO MAKE A DECISION ON WHAT WE SHOULD DO. I have always wanted once a year. Our YFA feels they will be breaking the law if they do not send recertification letters out every 6 months. Marina Harkness told me the day YFA sent out  the letters, some central agencies are operating under the old DCandF Rules.... which there are no rules!!!  We understand the Partnership will not be voting on the Rules on Thursday.\n \nLast week, over 400 recertification letters were sent out to our Polk Prek parents to recertify in February!!! \nFirst of all, the letter is 4 pages and some parents panic because they can't read forms well or don't think they need to send  all the information again. They are scared or don't want to go through all the hassle again and are dropping out. The children suffer. We finally have 931 enrolled and we are all frantically trying to encourage parents to stay and we will help them recertify.  This article confirms our dilemma.\n \n Nan\n \n \n-----Original Message----- \n"

Coupled with higher than expected treatment costs, district officials now find themselves in a $13.4 million hole. \n\nLocal service providers, whose services range from group home care to assisted living and after-school programs, say that existing clients may be most dramatically affected because lawmakers have also required them to reduce waiting lists of people seeking services. \n\nLike many of his fellow providers, Roger Baker must seek private sources to augment state and federal funds to make ends meet. \n\nTalk that local providers are charging too much and responsible for the shortfall is absurd, says Baker, the executive director of ARC of Indian River County. \n\n\"These cuts would have a direct impact on client services,\" said Roger Baker, executive director of the ARC of Indian River County. \"When you're already only receiving funding for 80 percent of the cost of services, how can they say that your rates are too high?\" \n\n\"If I am going to have to cut rates, I'm going to have to cut services, too; it's that simple,\" said John Gonzalez, CEO of ARC of Martin County, which provides services for 125 clients. \n\nLocal provider were warned earlier this month when they received a memo from DCF Deputy Secretary Lucy Hadi alerting them that cuts would be necessary. State DCF officials had only been aware of the shortfall for a couple weeks prior to the Dec. 3 memo. \n\nLast year, DCF officials received an additional $10 million to fill a gap in current year funding. The amount, it turns out, was inadequate to handle the swelling client ranks. \n\n\"We're not trying to do a bad thing here, but we have a constitutional prohibition here in Florida for deficit spending,\" Hadi told the Press Journal earlier this month. \"We can't spend more than we have appropriated. What we're trying to do now is to bring our expenses in line with what the appropriation is.\" \n\nFollowing a flurry of concern from local providers, however, state officials have held a series of conference calls and have scheduled a meeting for mid-January between the department and local providers to study options. \n\n\"We're going to have to find ways to review the cases and see if there are services that might no longer be necessary,\" Hadi said. \"A lot of things that we are going to have to do is just a lot of hard work.\" \n\n\nThe above information is provided as a service and is not necessarily the opinion of Disability Relations Group or its management.\n\nIf you would like to be removed from future mailings please send email to drg@drgglobal.com and type REMOVE in the subject line.\n\n"

And it's true: The news media are biased.\n\nWe're biased in favor of change, as opposed to the status quo. We're biased in favor of bad news, rather than good news. We're biased in favor of conflict rather than harmony.\n\nIncreasingly, we're biased in favor of sensationalism, scandal, celebrities and violence, as opposed to serious, insightful coverage of the important issues of the day.\n\nBut most of the time, on most stories, I don't think most reporters and editors are biased in the way that our most virulent critics suggest. We don't, consciously or subconsciously, slant our stories to fit our ideology.\n\nYes, I've read and heard all the complaints about most journalists voting for Al Gore over George W. Bush -- and for Bill Clinton over Bob Dole and for every other Democrat over every other Republican dating back at least to John Kennedy over Richard Nixon. This pattern supposedly proves that all reporters are liberals and their coverage is slanted to the Left.\n\nI've also read and heard all the complaints about most major news organizations being owned by Republicans -- and, more recently, about all the major radio talk shows, plus Fox TV News, being dominated by conservatives, thus proving that the media are, in fact, slanted to the Right.\n\nSure, most reporters, like most other sentient beings, do have an ideology of sorts -- that is, we have personal opinions, often strong and, in our case, generally liberal. Only the uninformed or the inert have no opinions, and on issue after issue -- race relations, gun control, the environment, government spending, gay rights, capital punishment -- I think most journalists are more liberal than are most other Americans.\n\nYes, the people who own the conglomerates that own the television networks and many other major news organizations tend, like most other big businessmen, to be Republicans, as do the most successful talk-show hosts. And if Fox News is \"fair and balanced,\" as its slogan boasts, it's certainly not intentional.\n\nBut to suggest that all this means, ipso facto, the media are politically biased in their news coverage is syllogistic reasoning at its worst. Talk radio hosts don't pretend to be impartial journalists. Fox is but one of many news outlets. In my experience, neither the conservative media moguls nor the liberal reporters try to impose their views on news stories.\n\nEqually important, I honestly believe that most good reporters are able to set aside their personal political views when they cover a story.\n\nNevertheless, judging from what I read in my e-mail and hear on talk radio -- and looking at the success of Bernard Goldberg's book \"Bias,\" which spent seven weeks atop the New York Times bestseller list early last year -- it's clear that allegations of ideological bias ring true with many Americans.\n\nAfter all, they reason, if you feel strongly about a particular cause or a particular candidate, why wouldn't you use your journalistic platform to advance that cause or candidate? More to the point, how could you avoid doing so, at least subconsciously, no matter how committed you are to being fair? Wouldn't your personal feelings seep into the decisions, large and small, that you make as a journalist -- what stories to do, whom to interview, whom to quote, whom not to quote, what facts to emphasize, what language to use?\n\nSometimes -- rarely -- that does happen. Despite some evidence to the contrary, journalists are only human. And sometimes reporters bend so far backward trying to be fair that they wind up unfairly hurting the cause or candidate that many of them personally favor.\n\nBut I think the very real biases mentioned earlier -- the individual and institutional preference for change, conflict, bad news and sensationalism -- are far more common, and far more damaging, than any kind of intermittent, inadvertent ideological bias.\n\nIn the months and years before Sept. 11, most news organizations all but abandoned coverage of international news, and while Osama bin Laden, Saddam Hussein and their terrorist colleagues have temporarily refocused much of the media attention on truly significant matters, even some of those matters (vide anthrax) have been covered in sensationalist style.\n\nEqually bad, the \"let's you and him fight\" school of journalism, in which the slightest disagreement among public figures is blown up into bitter conflict, makes us look more like provocateurs than chroniclers. How many times will we read that Colin Powell is on his way out as secretary of state because he's losing the corridors-of-power battles with administration hard-liners? Wasn't it the summer of 2001 when we were reading that Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld was on his way out because he was losing a battle with Congress and military professionals over Bush's plan to overhaul the Pentagon?\n\nAn attitude that distorts\n\nThe news media's knee-jerk adversarial position toward those in power -- and our sneering assumption that virtually every politician is a liar or a hypocrite, invariably acting out of self-interest and self-aggrandizement, rather than out of a commitment to the public good -- has contributed to steadily declining voter turnout, discouraged many good men and women from seeking office, and makes us seem like cynical, self-righteous scandal-mongers.\n\nJim Lehrer of the Public Broadcasting Service has spoken of the \"stench of contempt\" that distorts much of our reportage -- and of the concomitant implication that only journalists are \"smart enough to know what to do\" about the various problems confronting society today.\n\nWorst of all, the growing sensationalism-cum-trivialization of the news embodied in the media's sequential obsessions with O.J., Princess Di, Monica Lewinsky, Gary Condit, Martha Stewart, Elian Gonzales, shark attacks, the Indiana mother caught on tape apparently beating her 4-year-old daughter, and the frantic search for allegedly missing children (at a time when FBI statistics show that the kidnapping of children has actually declined) leaves us little time or space to cover the truly important issues of the day.\n\nThe media have made their daily news report much softer in recent years, and in the process, they've decided to devote much less time to politics and public affairs, says Thomas E. Patterson, who teaches at Harvard's Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy.\n\n\"Celebrity profiles, lifestyle scenes, hard-luck tales, good-luck tales and other human-interest stories rose from 11% to more than 20% of news coverage from 1980 to 1999,\" according to a Shorenstein Center study quoted in Patterson's new book, \"The Vanishing Voter.\" \"Stories about dramatic incidents -- crimes and disasters -- also doubled during this period. The number of news stories that contained elements of sensationalism jumped by 75%.\"\n\nAs \"soft news\" has taken up more space in newspaper news sections, \"public-affairs coverage [has] dwindled,\" Patterson writes. \"From 1980 to 2000, public-affairs stories decreased from 70% of news coverage to 50%.\"\n\nSo the way I see it, the problem with the media's political coverage isn't bias. It's shrinkage. And superficiality. I worry far more about the tarting up and dumbing down of our news media than I do about any ideological infiltration.\n\n\n\n"

I feel blessed to have a governor who truly cares about \nall including the small businesses and not just the corporate giants.  I work \nwith media and I want them to know that they can't spin what you do for the \npeople of Florida.  \n\n     We found a leasing company that was willing to take us.  We have to pay \nthem now for payroll services as that was tied into their package.  It will \nbe thousands more than what we were spending, but it won't be as high as the \noutrages rates we were looking at in the State pool.\n\n     All this put us on edge, as we have noticed a dip in business since \nbefore Christmas.  Even a local attorney who eats at our restaurant asked for \nsome coupons.  My husband spends most of his investment in buying quality \nproducts, so he does not have the margin to discount like Papa Johns or \nDominos.  Our prices were already low for Fairbanks/Winter Park and for our \n436 and Perishing store near the Orlando Airport.  We have had to spend so \nmuch more in marketing and coupons that our profits are down.   \n\n     We are still seriously planning to investigate selling if our overhead \nand insurance keeps rising.  It's sad.  We have 3 children to put through \ncollege.  Everyone loves my husband and his food.  Some drive over an hour to \neat our pizza.  He's done it so long since 1984, I don't know what would be \nnext.  Many of the distributors have told us they have been down too.\n\n     If the insurance companies drive people out of business, then there is \nless taxes being made by the state and unemployment going out.  It's a pickle \nfor sure.  We truly enjoyed meeting Kevin.  He is such a sharp guy.  I am \nsure he will be an asset to your administration. \n\n     I keep seeing your son being more involved in politics in the future.  \nHe will be well received and reach broader groups than expected.  I first \nstarted getting this when I saw him as a young boy on stage say \"Viva La \nBush\" or something like that when your father was running for President.  I \nsaw God's hand on him and that he will have great responsibilities.  It was \namazing.\n\nI do want to share one more thing.  We were in a Dillards in Altamonte \nSprings and we met a nice man from Turkey who waited on us that came to the \nU.S. through the lottery 5 years ago.  He is a chemist, wife is a pharmacist \nthey have children.  He made a comment that got my attention.  He said he \nstopped going to the Mosque because the leader would not stop focusing on the \npresident and the war.  He said he felt we should live peacefully with all, \nbut this leader of the Mosque had a different spirit.  May want to have the \nthis area checked out.\n\nEnough of my chattering.  Blessings to your family.\n\nSincerely,\nAndrea Boulden-Gagliano\nabelcomm@aol.com\n407-740-7727, fax 407-539-2180\n"

One problem we have yet to overcome at UF is \nintellectual property rights on distance learning courses. UF has no firm \nstatement of faculty rights and so few faculty have been willing to develop \non-line content until UF adopts a clear policy similar to that other \nuniversities have adopted that assigns those rights solely to faculty (as in \nmy rights to my books). As far as UCF courses, I headed a team that developed \na proposal for the on-line courses contract. We didn't get the award but UCF \ncalled us and wanted to use the on-line content we already inherited from the \nlarge-scale research project at Michigan State's Center for Improving Early \nReading Achievement. I suggested that if UCF was willing to give us $1M of \nthe funding they got we would cooperate. But no. Our content is video drawn \nfrom exemplary teacher classrooms that has been designed to teach teacher Ed \ncandidates to actually \"see\" excellent instruction. It has been well \nresearched and we use it in some of undergrad courses. Dr. Rick Ferdig, a new \nasst. prof from MSU is the better contact person for that content. As far as \nthe UCF course content, they are handicapped in that they have no reading \nresearchers on faculty and so rely on secondary reports of what the research \nsays. Unfortunately many of the secondary reports, including the federal Put \nReading First document have been shown to present a substantial distortion of \nwhat the national Reading Panel actually found and often offers \n\"research-based\" advice that contradicts the NRP and the larger existing \ndatabase.\n\nDick Allington\n\n\n\nDick,\nThank you very much for your response. It is very enlightening. We should get \ntogether when you return to Gainesville. I'm interested in learning more \nabout the various reading methods and might be able to facilitate a policy \nresolution at UF to get distance learning started. No promises, but I do know \nall the key players including some of the UF trustees. Take a look at your \nschedule and give me some options. I'm out of town next Wednesday through \nFriday. My cell phone is the best way to reach me, 352-219-3084, or this \nemail address which I check frequently.\nI sent an email to Catherine Emihovich this afternoon expressing my interest \nin developing an online reading course for teachers K-12. I realize the UCF \nprocess may be flawed but it has the support of the Jeb Bush administration, \nand I'm sure you would agree any effort to improve reading is better than no \neffort. Jeb introduced me (via email) to Mary Laura Openshaw who heads up his \nreading program and she directed me to Dr. Torgesen and UCF who I have not \nmade contact with. The Governor's office called today to say they were \nsending me some information because I wanted to learn about the various \nreading teaching philosophies. Sounds like you're someone who could help me \nlearn quickly.\nThanks again for the response,\nPeter Johnson\n\nPeter\n\nI'm in WI on T-W so it looks like next week (27th) might be better time to \ntry and talk. I'm not sure that I disagree very much Torgesen on reading \nresearch -- I do think phonological skills are overrated as problem though \nand that phonics is overrated as a solution but I think my pessimism is based \nin the research, including Joe's. I do think that one-size-fits-all mandates \nof the sort being offered under the Reading First initiative are also not \nsupported by the research. And finally there is NO research that suggest that \nwe can improve teaching through videos or on-line courses. This is an area \nI'd very much like to research however (and several colleagues would also \njump at the chance to evaluate such efforts whether UCF's courses or other \nefforts).\n\nDick Allington\n\nDate:   01/19/2003 3:30:23 PM Eastern Standard Time\n"

        "body": "\nthank you Arnold. I am passing on an article in the Herald on the subject:\n\n\nPosted on Sun, Jan. 19, 2003\t story:PUB_DESC\t \t\n\t\nGov. Bush impresses with racial policy legal brief\n\nIf the U.S. Supreme Court bans race-based university admissions, the nation's anti-affirmative action movement could well owe a greater debt of gratitude to Florida Gov. Jeb Bush than to his brother, the president.\n\nWhile President Bush won national acclaim from conservatives for his request last week that the court examine race preferences, it was the Florida governor -- far more than the president -- who dove headlong into the fight on behalf of their party's political base.\n\nAs scholars analyzed the legal briefs submitted late last week by the White House and the Florida governor's office in a case involving the University of Michigan, they quickly concluded that the president had side-stepped the most pressing questions related to the legality of race preferences while Gov. Bush made the only argument that could lead to their abolition.\n\n''Jeb Bush's brief goes from page one to a conclusion, whereas the president's brief goes from page one to a blank sheet of paper,'' said Ed Blum, legal director for the American Civil Rights Institute, the group headed by Ward Connerly that ended affirmative action in California and tried to mount a similar campaign in Florida.\n\n''The question before the court is, is diversity so important to the educational experience of a college student that a university can factor race into the equation when accepting or rejecting students?'' Blum said. ``The president's brief didn't answer that question.''\n\nThe governor's did.\n\n''Racial diversity,'' his brief reads, ``is no more compelling a goal in the higher education context than in the context of other institutions or areas of state decision-making, including those upon which this Court has already ruled [negatively].''\n\nGov. Bush's brief goes on to call ''problematic'' the University of Michigan's assumption that racial diversity is equal to academic or ''viewpoint'' diversity.\n\nThat, legal scholars say, is the very question that will face the Supreme Court if the justices are to overturn a 1978 decision that set the standard for race-based preferences.\n\n''Jeb's brief is respectful to the court in that it answers the question they care about,'' said Todd Gaziano, director of the Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation, which lobbied the White House to make its brief more like Gov. Bush's.\n\nFlorida's so-called friend-of-the-court brief carries minuscule legal weight compared to the arguments offered on behalf of the White House by the U.S. solicitor general.\n\nBut, scholars agreed, it carries greater weight simply because it comes from the president's own brother, from a mega-state governor who was the first to roll back affirmative action in his state and from a man who is married to a Hispanic woman.\n\nIf the governor's brief does not influence the court -- and some thought it could at a minimum apply some pressure for a landmark ruling -- it will no doubt affect the public dialogue. And Jeb Bush, who won reelection overwhelmingly last year despite a first term tinged with racial tension, is obviously feeling far more free to air his views than a president who needs blacks and Hispanics to win reelection in 2004.\n\nPerhaps it was that potential outcome that led the governor's lawyers to craft a defense of Jeb Bush's entire record on race that looks more like the text of a campaign speech than a legal missive.\n\nCalling the Jeb Bush way the ''better way,'' the brief not only promotes the One Florida Initiative that rolled back affirmative action, but also links the governor's controversial education programs and his touchy-feely mentoring initiatives as a potential national alternative to race preferences.\n\nIt is perhaps Gov. Bush's first draft of what he thinks his political epitaph ought to someday read. He may never run for president, but this may be his way of taking his agenda to the national political stage.\n\nAnd it helps erase a rocky political record on race that dates back to the governor's 1994 campaign for governor when Bush said he would do ''probably nothing'' for blacks. The record has stretched through the marches and protests over One Florida, and the contested 2000 presidential election in which many black voters blamed him for a failed voting system.\n\n''Florida's plan is better,'' reads his brief, ``in that it no longer accepts the lack of quality in the public schools that serve our underprivileged children; better because it recognizes the need to provide mentoring, tutoring, and other extra attention to those underprivileged children and their teachers; better because it encourages all students regardless of race or economic status to aspire to post-secondary education; better because it no longer accepts a separate standard on the basis of race; better because it focuses on providing all races with the opportunity to meet common standards, and finally, better because it looks forward to a day when racial classifications and separate standards are no longer deemed necessary by anyone.''\n\nThis is, to be sure, one man's view of himself.\n\nMany black leaders in Florida question the Bush record on race. Bush argues correctly that the number of minorities entering college has remained stable or even slightly increased under One Florida, but some black leaders argue that the success has not necessarily translated to the flagship schools and premier academic programs.\n\nState Sen. Les Miller, a Tampa Democrat who heads the Legislature's black caucus, accused Bush of living ''in a vacuum'' when it comes to race, reminding us that it was the One Florida program that sparked one of the biggest civil rights protests in state history and prompted a sit-in by black legislators.\n\n''Jeb Bush should not be inserting himself in an issue that has nothing to with the state of Florida,'' Miller said. ``At a time when the Republican Party talks about healing relations with African Americans, an action like this unnecessarily serves to divide our state and our nation.''\n\nBut Miller may be missing the point. If Jeb Bush can make a case that One Florida, coupled with his education policies and his focus on reading and mentoring, actually accomplishes more than generations of race preferences and affirmative action, he could turn the partisan debate over race on its head. At a minimum, he gets the conversation going while his brother avoids the treacherousness of killing affirmative action just as he builds an ethnic coalition to assure reelection.\n\nPeter Wallsten is chief of The Herald's Capital Bureau\n\npwallsten@herald.com <mailto:pwallsten@herald.com>\n\n\t\t \t  <javascript:RightslinkPopUp('Knight Ridder Inc.','miamiherald','Gov.

In her short seven years of life, she has worked harder and faced more challenges than most adults.  Because of her strong will, our perservence, and the help of many professionals and volunteers, Savannah is a walking miracle, literally.  She has endured numerous surgeries, ranging from eye and ear procedures all the way to open heart surgery.  She has spent more than her share of hours in hospital rooms, and has endured countless hours of physical, occupational, and speech therapies.  She progressed from ambulating in a wheelchair to using a walker.  In February of 2002, her ENT, Dr. James Atkins, performed a surgery that enabled her to walk independently.  At 6 1/2 years old, our daughter began walking by herself!  It was through subsequent hours of physical therapy that she was able to gain true independence.  Then our insurance coverage expired.  Her physical therapist volunteered her time with Savannah for 5 months while we awaited her turn to receive Med-waiver services.  She finally had to move on to other patients.  We are still waiting.\n \n     Our daughter does not speak, but we recently discovered, through a speaker at World Congress, that she has a physical condition that may be corrected.  Through surgery and intensive speech therapy, Savannah will have the chance to voice her thoughts, feelings, and opinions.  We want nothing less than for our daughter to walk AND talk, and we intend to use every avenue and resource possible to make this happen.    \n \n     Governor Bush, we listened as you spoke to us at Orlando's World Congress on Disabilities and told the story of a young lady whose life was dramatically changed through the help that med-waiver services provided her.  We listened as the audience applauded your statement that all the people on the original waiting list for med-waiver are being serviced.  We, however, sat with tears in our eyes.\n \n     We need answers that developmental services personnel in central Florida, as well as those in Tallahassee, will not provide.  When will Savannah receive her med-waiver services?  Where is she on \"the list?\"  We are told that she will receive services when she \"shows up on the computer.\"  Governor Bush, that's not good enough.  There has to be some accountability as to Savannah's place in the system.  She is not a case to us.  She is a beautiful daughter, sister, granddaughter, dancer, Daisy girl scout, friend, and inspiration to those meet her.  Please help us find the answer to exactly where Savannah stands on the med-waiver waiting list, and when she will begin receiving the services that we've awaited two years so far.  Someone has answers to our questions.  We are entitled to, and she deserves, these answers.\n \n                                                                              Respectfully,\n                                                                              Kevin and Sheri Mathews\n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n"

Jeric Heflin, 19, the brother of my 6th Grade student, Melody Heflin, was featured on the front page of The Lakeland Ledger (see his picture below).  \n \n       After I got over the shock of just how YOUNG this young man looks and is, I asked my vivacious Melody to have her brother come to our World Geography and History classes so we could encourage him and let him know how PROUD we are of him as he was to soon leave for duty in the Middle East conflict.\n \n       A few days later, I asked Melody about when Jeric was going to come visit us because he only had 10 days before he was to be deployed.  She shook her head \"No\" and after questioning her, she stated, \"He's just too SHY to come see us, Ms. Bryan.\"  I assured her that that was O.K., but asked her to tell him that if he didn't care, my classes would like to \"adopt\" him as their \"BIG BROTHER\" and send him cards, letters and candy--things to let him know WE CARE about his sacrifices so we Americans can be FREE here each day! \n \n      She broke out in a big, sunny grin and said, \"He'll like that Ms. Bryan, I'll tell him.\"\n \n      The days quickly flew by--as they tend to do and last Thursday morning's Planning Period was unusually hectic for me.  There just wasn't enough time to do all that was necessary before my next class arrived:  getting the day's FCAT practice tests ready, putting all the assignments and that day's Motivational Moment on the board, writing next week's lesson plans, and catching up on our school's internal email messages.  \n \n       As I hurried to complete the most vital tasks, my door suddenly opened and the very competent teacher next door quickly asked, \"Ms. Bryan, can Melody please come in here with you?  She's totally broken down, her brother was shipped out today!  I'm in the middle of a Reading assignment that we must finish before the period is over and Melody needs some special attention.\" \n \n      Dear God, I said in my mind, HOW DO I COMFORT this usually coquettish child who has probably never faced any SEPARATION from this very CHERISED, older brother, much less this type of separation??  And what about the things I MUST DO before my students arrive??\n \n      Melody, whose streaked and redden face told me that she had been crying profusely, quickly ran into my arms as I told my comrade next door, \"I'll keep her--it is all right!\"  \n \n      Relieved that she could now get her other students settled and back on task, my neighbor closed our connecting door and returned to direct her antsy charges.\n \n      Now, in silence--Melody and I just stood--rocking  back and forth with our arms wrapped around each other.  I stroked her hair and tried--desperately--to remember what I'd learned about handling LOSS and GRIEF!  Just what do you say to console an 11 year old about her 19 year old brother leaving to go off--possibly to a war half-way around the world--when no one can say WHEN he'll return or even IF he'll be coming back??  \n \n       The only thing that my mind could grab on to say, was \"I am so SORRY!\"  \n \n       Knowing from my own experiences in dealing with grief how trite \"I know how you feel\" sounds in times of anguish, I instinctively knew not to voice that.  But, WHAT do you say?  We stood, slightly rocking back and forth for a long time, with Melody's face buried into my sweater.  When she got quiet, I gently put her at arm's length and looked into her young, tear-stained, swollen face and said, \"Honey, do you want to talk about it?\"  Her shook her head vehemently--and said a determined \"NO!\", so I just pulled her back to me and held her some more.\n \n      \"Now what am I do?\" my mind questioned.  The clock on our back wall told me that the bell would ring soon--but this child is hurting!  WHAT in the world can I say that will make a difference in this?  Just what is my responsibility?  How to I get some of my tasks done? \n \n     Finally, I remember that Melody likes to draw, even MORE than most kids.  I quietly said, \"Melody, did you get to say EVERYTHING that you wanted to say to your brother before he left?\"\n \n     \"No Ma'am,\" she haltingly responded.  \n \n     \"Well, how do you feel about drawing him a card and put some of those things on it that you didn't have time to tell him?\"\n \n     \"My mother only has an address where he'll be at for today, after that we don't know.\" she answered pitifully.\n \n    \"Well, Honey, as soon as they get him to base, he'll be allowed to call home and then if you have your card ready you can mail it to him.  Do you think that might work?\"\n \n     She shook her head saying O.K. and I hurried got her paper as she when to procure our classroom basket of markers.  She set to work at a table near me, as I prayed this redirection tactic would as least temporarily ease some of her pain.\n \n    Within just a moment or two, she had four beautiful red hearts drawn diagonally in each corner of her \"card\" and was beginning another one in the top center of the page.  Every few minutes, as we worked, I asked how she was coming along. \n \n    \"Hum, O.K.\" was her response each time. The bell rang--and my 7th Grade class came pouring in.  To be honest I only got a flash of Melody's almost finished card to her brother.  But, somehow this experience has touched me--made me MORE aware of THE COST OF FREEDOM than any other experience in my life!\n \n    My hat is definitely off to all the Jeric's and Melody's and the myriads of families that they represent, as America--once again, faces an uncertain future with yet another war looming on our horizon.  But, without their sacrifice we would NOT be privileged to live in our precious HOME of the FREE and LAND of the BRAVE.\n \nMay GOD continue to BLESS AMERICA and especially our Military personnel and their families!\n \nSincerely,\n \nMs. Ellen Irene Bryan, Patriot and Teacher\n \n Turn up your sound--sit back and reflect on our freedoms and how they are PRESERVED for us EACH DAY!\n \nWe are SO BLESSED by the SACRIFICES of many!\n \nMAY GOD CONTINUE TO BLESS AMERICA--especially our Military!!!!\nEllen\n\n\n Picture <http://imgsrv.theledger.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?Site=LL&Date=20030103&Category=NEWS&ArtNo=301030361&Ref=AR&MaxW=180> \n\n\nSCOTT WHEELER/Ledger photos Pfc.

We are all divinely inspired as God's creatures.. Those with developmental disabilities are divinely inspired as well,  but have an added protection and closeness with God. I have not consulted with divinity professors on this. I have not asked my priest. I just plain believe it. I just know that our Lord would protect them above all others. \n \nSo, acting on that belief, it is our obligation to make sure that they receive our support in His honor and in recognition of their dignity. \n \nThat is easier said than done. Their families are fiercely loyal and many times frustrated. They are angry after a near generation of hurt and betrayal. I have tried to rectify this with doubling of the funding in four years but have been betrayed myself by a beacuracry that is insensitive and incompetent. \n \nNow you step in. Shelly, my hope is that you clean up the mess and shoot straight with our constituents. \nTell them the truth and I will go to bat for you to the bitter end. No more empty promises. Only the truth and hope will prevail. I know that Secretary Regier will support you and so will I! \n \n \nThank you for agreeing to serve.. \n \n\nJeb Bush\n\n***********************************************************\nPlease note: Florida has a very broad public records law.\nMost written communications to or from state officials\nregarding state business are public records available to the\npublic and media upon request.

        "body": "Cc: Laura Branker (E-mail)\n\n\nGovernor,\n \nI realize this explanation may not bring comfort or change this family's desperate circumstances, but the original Developmental Disabilities spending plan provided services to individuals who became eligible for the Waiver prior to July 1, 1999 (these are individuals on the original waiting list who have all been served thanks to your leadership and support from the legislature); or individuals who are in a crisis situation.  Persons determined to be eligible after July 1, 1999 have been being placed on the waiting list. According to the information provided in the e-mail below, Savannah was not placed on the waiting list until September 1999. The order in which individuals will be served from the waiting list is based on the date the individual became a client of Developmental Disabilities. Savannah should be high on the waiting list, but I will need to confirm her placement with the DD program. \n\n \n\nThe family also mentions that they have lost their insurance. If their income is below 200% of the poverty level, they may be eligible for Medicaid Title 21 coverage through our Kidcare program or HealthyKids. If their income is above 200% of the federal poverty level, they would not be eligible for Title 21 and may be seeking enrollment in the DS waiver to become eligible through a special waiver income category which allows a child to qualify  as \"a family of one.\" This is a special provision under the waiver program which allows Medicaid to discount the parental income when determining the child's financial eligibility for the program. We have approximately 2000 children currently enrolled in the DS waiver program who fall in this category.  I'm sure you probably already know this, but  your friend, Lucy was one of the first children to quality under this special provision. \n\n \n\nObviously, the current budget deficit presents a serious challenge to original plans to begin serving 1,542 individuals on the waiting list with funds allocated by the 2002 legislature. The original DD program spending plan would have begun to phase in these individuals over the next 6 months. I am hopeful, but still uncertain as to whether or not the department can begin serving individuals on the waiting list since July  1, 1999 (other than those deemed in \"crisis status.\")  Regardless, Savannah should be among the first new people to be served given her application date. I would also be interested to know whether or not the child has been considered for \"crisis status\" given the recent loss of insurance. I plan to look into this as well as her current status on the waiting list to provide you and the family a more definitive answer. \n\n \n\nPlease let me know if you would like for me to draft a response on your behalf or contact this family directly to try to offer an explanation and whatever support we can offer.\n\n \n\nShelly\n\n \n\n \n\n-----Original Message-----\n"

        "body": "\n\n \n \nDear Governor Bush,\n \n    This little girl is our daughter, Savannah Leigh Mathews.  She is a client of Developmental Services, and has been since September 2, 1999.  In her short seven years of life, she has worked harder and faced more challenges than most adults.  Because of her strong will, our perservence, and the help of many professionals and volunteers, Savannah is a walking miracle, literally.  She has endured numerous surgeries, ranging from eye and ear procedures all the way to open heart surgery.  She has spent more than her share of hours in hospital rooms, and has endured countless hours of physical, occupational, and speech therapies.  She progressed from ambulating in a wheelchair to using a walker.  In February of 2002, her ENT, Dr. James Atkins, performed a surgery that enabled her to walk independently.  At 6 1/2 years old, our daughter began walking by herself!  It was through subsequent hours of physical therapy that she was able to gain true independence.  Then our insurance coverage expired.  Her physical therapist volunteered her time with Savannah for 5 months while we awaited her turn to receive Med-waiver services.  She finally had to move on to other patients.  We are still waiting.\n \n     Our daughter does not speak, but we recently discovered, through a speaker at World Congress, that she has a physical condition that may be corrected.  Through surgery and intensive speech therapy, Savannah will have the chance to voice her thoughts, feelings, and opinions.  We want nothing less than for our daughter to walk AND talk, and we intend to use every avenue and resource possible to make this happen.    \n \n     Governor Bush, we listened as you spoke to us at Orlando's World Congress on Disabilities and told the story of a young lady whose life was dramatically changed through the help that med-waiver services provided her.  We listened as the audience applauded your statement that all the people on the original waiting list for med-waiver are being serviced.  We, however, sat with tears in our eyes.\n \n     We need answers that developmental services personnel in central Florida, as well as those in Tallahassee, will not provide.  When will Savannah receive her med-waiver services?  Where is she on \"the list?\"  We are told that she will receive services when she \"shows up on the computer.\"  Governor Bush, that's not good enough.  There has to be some accountability as to Savannah's place in the system.  She is not a case to us.  She is a beautiful daughter, sister, granddaughter, dancer, Daisy girl scout, friend, and inspiration to those meet her.  Please help us find the answer to exactly where Savannah stands on the med-waiver waiting list, and when she will begin receiving the services that we've awaited two years so far.  Someone has answers to our questions.  We are entitled to, and she deserves, these answers.\n \n                                                                              Respectfully,\n                                                                              Kevin and Sheri Mathews\n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n\n"

        "body": "\n\nJanuary 20, 2003\n \nDear Friends,\n \n      Something unusual happened one morning this past week in my classroom.  Even though this was an unusual event in MY LIFE--I know similar scenarios have been played out MANY thousands of times in recent weeks and all  throughout America's history as our country continually fights for our FREEDOMS.   So I would like to share this event with you, in HONOR of our brave, dedicated SERVICE MEN AND WOMEN and their SACRIFICIAL FAMILIES:  \n \n       On January 3, a picture of Pfc. Jeric Heflin, 19, the brother of my 6th Grade student, Melody Heflin, was featured on the front page of The Lakeland Ledger (see his picture below).  \n \n       After I got over the shock of just how YOUNG this young man looks and is, I asked my vivacious Melody to have her brother come to our World Geography and History classes so we could encourage him and let him know how PROUD we are of him as he was to soon leave for duty in the Middle East conflict.\n \n       A few days later, I asked Melody about when Jeric was going to come visit us because he only had 10 days before he was to be deployed.  She shook her head \"No\" and after questioning her, she stated, \"He's just too SHY to come see us, Ms. Bryan.\"  I assured her that that was O.K., but asked her to tell him that if he didn't care, my classes would like to \"adopt\" him as their \"BIG BROTHER\" and send him cards, letters and candy--things to let him know WE CARE about his sacrifices so we Americans can be FREE here each day! \n \n      She broke out in a big, sunny grin and said, \"He'll like that Ms. Bryan, I'll tell him.\"\n \n      The days quickly flew by--as they tend to do and last Thursday morning's Planning Period was unusually hectic for me.  There just wasn't enough time to do all that was necessary before my next class arrived:  getting the day's FCAT practice tests ready, putting all the assignments and that day's Motivational Moment on the board, writing next week's lesson plans, and catching up on our school's internal email messages.  \n \n       As I hurried to complete the most vital tasks, my door suddenly opened and the very competent teacher next door quickly asked, \"Ms. Bryan, can Melody please come in here with you?  She's totally broken down, her brother was shipped out today!  I'm in the middle of a Reading assignment that we must finish before the period is over and Melody needs some special attention.\" \n \n      Dear God, I said in my mind, HOW DO I COMFORT this usually coquettish child who has probably never faced any SEPARATION from this very CHERISED, older brother, much less this type of separation??  And what about the things I MUST DO before my students arrive??\n \n      Melody, whose streaked and redden face told me that she had been crying profusely, quickly ran into my arms as I told my comrade next door, \"I'll keep her--it is all right!\"  \n \n      Relieved that she could now get her other students settled and back on task, my neighbor closed our connecting door and returned to direct her antsy charges.\n \n      Now, in silence--Melody and I just stood--rocking  back and forth with our arms wrapped around each other.  I stroked her hair and tried--desperately--to remember what I'd learned about handling LOSS and GRIEF!  Just what do you say to console an 11 year old about her 19 year old brother leaving to go off--possibly to a war half-way around the world--when no one can say WHEN he'll return or even IF he'll be coming back??  \n \n       The only thing that my mind could grab on to say, was \"I am so SORRY!\"  \n \n       Knowing from my own experiences in dealing with grief how trite \"I know how you feel\" sounds in times of anguish, I instinctively knew not to voice that.  But, WHAT do you say?  We stood, slightly rocking back and forth for a long time, with Melody's face buried into my sweater.  When she got quiet, I gently put her at arm's length and looked into her young, tear-stained, swollen face and said, \"Honey, do you want to talk about it?\"  Her shook her head vehemently--and said a determined \"NO!\", so I just pulled her back to me and held her some more.\n \n      \"Now what am I do?\" my mind questioned.  The clock on our back wall told me that the bell would ring soon--but this child is hurting!  WHAT in the world can I say that will make a difference in this?  Just what is my responsibility?  How to I get some of my tasks done? \n \n     Finally, I remember that Melody likes to draw, even MORE than most kids.  I quietly said, \"Melody, did you get to say EVERYTHING that you wanted to say to your brother before he left?\"\n \n     \"No Ma'am,\" she haltingly responded.  \n \n     \"Well, how do you feel about drawing him a card and put some of those things on it that you didn't have time to tell him?\"\n \n     \"My mother only has an address where he'll be at for today, after that we don't know.\" she answered pitifully.\n \n    \"Well, Honey, as soon as they get him to base, he'll be allowed to call home and then if you have your card ready you can mail it to him.  Do you think that might work?\"\n \n     She shook her head saying O.K. and I hurried got her paper as she when to procure our classroom basket of markers.  She set to work at a table near me, as I prayed this redirection tactic would as least temporarily ease some of her pain.\n \n    Within just a moment or two, she had four beautiful red hearts drawn diagonally in each corner of her \"card\" and was beginning another one in the top center of the page.  Every few minutes, as we worked, I asked how she was coming along. \n \n    \"Hum, O.K.\" was her response each time. The bell rang--and my 7th Grade class came pouring in.  To be honest I only got a flash of Melody's almost finished card to her brother.  But, somehow this experience has touched me--made me MORE aware of THE COST OF FREEDOM than any other experience in my life!\n \n    My hat is definitely off to all the Jeric's and Melody's and the myriads of families that they represent, as America--once again, faces an uncertain future with yet another war looming on our horizon.  But, without their sacrifice we would NOT be privileged to live in our precious HOME of the FREE and LAND of the BRAVE.\n \nMay GOD continue to BLESS AMERICA and especially our Military personnel and their families!\n \nSincerely,\n \nMs. Ellen Irene Bryan, Patriot and Teacher\n \n Turn up your sound--sit back and reflect on our freedoms and how they are PRESERVED for us EACH DAY!\n \nWe are SO BLESSED by the SACRIFICES of many!\n \nMAY GOD CONTINUE TO BLESS AMERICA--especially our Military!!!!\nEllen\n\n\n Picture <http://imgsrv.theledger.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?Site=LL&Date=20030103&Category=NEWS&ArtNo=301030361&Ref=AR&MaxW=180> \n\n\nSCOTT WHEELER/Ledger photos Pfc.

Our state is quite fortunate to say the least to have as its Governor for another four years a person of your caliber and leadership as Florida faces many challenges.  Insurance is one of those challenge areas.  This is the reason for this contact with you.\n \nAs you continue the task of making permanent appointments of qualified people to serve your current administration, It is my strong hope that you consider making Kevin M. McCarty's appointment as the Director of the Office of Insurance Regulation permanent. Our State and your administration will benefit tremendously from Kevin's integrity, ability and professional background to oversee this reorganized department.   He has a proven track record every step of the way to his current position through numerous administrations.  In any given circumstance Kevin weighs the facts insightfully and fairly and makes even-handed decisions based on those facts.  His experience makes him uniquely qualified to do this job.  He knows Florida, its critical insurance issues, and how to rectify them in a manner that will do you and our state proud.  \n \nI have known Kevin personally and professionally for some 8 years.  I am familiar with many aspects of the the insurance arena or industry. I am concerned about our state's escalating insurance crisis and the potential damage it could cause.  It is very important that we have somebody in this position that knows Florida's critical insurance issues, the challenges ahead, and whom can do the job you want done to address those issues properly now while you are in Office.  We need that job done now.  Kevin is the person that can do that job now.  \n \nThis is why I am recommending that you make Kevin's temporary appointment permanent.  Should you deem it necessary, I would be happy to provide further information or discuss this with you or your Director of Appointments.  At any rate, I appreciate your consideration of my submission.  I remain,\n \nVery truly yours,\n\n\nCharles J. F.

I could not believe and/or understand that such a \"needy social program\" may be affected by cuts in our State budget.\n \nI thought of my sister Mayra D. Gutierrez, who did not choose to have a mental disability, .....................but she does.\nI thought of other mental patients like my sister Mayra, and I wondered, what would become of these individuals? ..........\nHow would they survive? What can they do?\n \nMy sister Mayra receives disability benefits in the amount of approximately $690/month while her medicine expenses exceeds $1100/month. What is she supposed to do if the program is terminated?  She, and others like her, can not function in our society without their 'needy' medicine.  \n \nWhat does the future hold for my sister Mayra? and others like her?\n \nShe could become a homeless.........How much would that cost the State and/or other local agencies or;\nShe could be committed to a mental institution like the new South Florida State Hospital......How much would that cost the State? or\nShe could become a criminal or comit a crime and be placed in a cell away from society. How much would that cost the State?\n \nIt is interesting to note that my sister, in her younger years, worked for the State, for 91/2 years. Unfortunatelly for her, she became mentally ill and was asked to resign before she could reach the '10 year mark', thus losing her aspiration for retirement benefits.\n \nI ask you to do everything in your power as Governor of this State to find a solution for the continuity of the Medically Needy program.\nI truly understand your responsibility to balance the budget, however, there may be other programs that may be reduced.... programs that may not have such a dramatic impact in the lives of our 'mental patients'. They, as individuals, deserve a right to be part of our society!\n \nI thank you in advance for your consideration to my request!\n \nRespectfully, \n \nMario H. Gutierrez\n \n"

PAT'S KIDS CARE WITH BEARS FOR SHERIFF'S TRAUMA BEAR PROGRAM\n\n(South Tampa - January 21, 2003) - Samantha Wells, a St. Patrick School 8th Grader, was moved by the words of President Bush after the September 11 attacks when he asked American children to step up and help Afghan children. She dutifully sent her dollars for the Afghan Children's Relief Fund. Then she found out about the Sheriff Department's Trauma Bear Program where deputies provide distressed children with a stuffed bear. \n\nSamantha brought an idea to student council, for St. Patrick Students to have a Teddy Bear Drive for the Sheriff's program. The idea was embraced by everyone and she put together the first St. Pat's Kids Care with Bears Drive that ask students and the local community to donate a Teddy Bears. Last year she collected over 280 bears. \n\nLast week she began the 2d Annual St. Pat's Kids Care With Bear Drive. At a special Mass on January 29 at St. Patrick Church, she will again present to a Sheriff Department representative all the bears collected from the students at the school. \n\nWhen asked why she took on such a challenge, the fourteen year old responds that she wanted to do something while serving on Student Council that would help her community and other children. St. Patrick's students and community have responded with cute little Teddy Bears arriving at the School daily.

        "body": "\nLetters to the Editors\n\nLawmakers must be good stewards of all public funds\n\n\n(c) St. Petersburg Times\npublished January 21, 2003 \n\nAs a member of the Legislative Budget Commission, I want to respond to some of the opinions expressed in the articles and editorial (Tallahassee's fanatics, Jan. 17) written by the St. Petersburg Times regarding federal tax dollars being rejected by the commission \n\nFirst, let me clarify that the state of Florida has not lost any federal funds. However, I believe it is my duty to scrutinize budget expenditures to ensure that all money, both state and federal, is being spent in a responsible manner. Remember, federal dollars are Floridians' hard-earned tax money, too. \n\nApproval of an underground storage tank cleanup, a public awareness campaign for cardiovascular disease, and funding for the Department of Environmental Protection was simply delayed until we receive further detailed information from the respective agencies. Without question, it is my full intent to maximize the amount of federal dollars coming into our state. It is also my duty to the citizens of this state to be a good steward of the people's money. \n\nThe Legislative Budget Commission will reconvene in February, and I firmly believe that we will have the additional information needed to approve these expenditures.\n-- Gus M. Bilirakis, representative, Florida House District 48, Tarpon Springs \n\nProud to be a \"Tallahassee fanatic'\n\nRe: Florida lawmakers snub free money, Jan. 16 and Tallahassee's fanatics, editorial, Jan. 17. \n\nAs a member of the Legislative Budget Commission, I am writing to set the record straight and correct the misrepresentations and arrogant tone of, to use your word, the \"grotesque\" editorial referenced above. \n\nIn brief, the Legislative Budget Commission reviews state agency requests for funding changes \"off-budget,\" which means when Legislators are not in session. \n\nSeveral points are important: \n\n1. There is no such thing as \"free money\" as your misleading headline reflected last week. It is hard-earned taxpayer money that we are considering, not money from Santa or the Tooth Fairy. \n\n2. It is not cardiovascular disease education, child nutrition programs or oil spill cleanup issues that were being questioned. It is the process by which these funds are appropriated that was questioned. \n\n3. Federal money (taxpayer money) was not given up, was not lost. Conservatives do recognize the value of getting Florida taxpayer money back from Washington. \n\n4. A Legislator does not need past experience on an appropriation committee to be able to assess proper fund transfers and adjustments to prior budget expenditures. \n\n5. During the February meeting of the Legislative Budget Commission, the requests that were voted down will be reconsidered, and I fully expect to be able to vote for them. \n\n6. As for this House seat being better left empty, incorrect again. It would be far worse if an \"empty suit\" were occupying it. \n\nThank you for referring to me (and my colleagues) as \"Tallahassee fanatics.\" The citizens I represent (especially single-parent families and seniors on fixed incomes) expect no less intensity and vigilance when government spends their money.\n-- Leslie Waters, representative, Florida House District 51, St. Petersburg \n\nAn outrageous snub\n\nRe: Florida lawmakers snub free money, Jan. 16. \n\nOutraged. That's all I could feel when reading the article about the Legislature, in particular the House, not drawing down federal dollars to help our health care system. First we had state Rep. Frank Farkas, who was leading the charge to do away with mammograms, and now we have state Rep. Leslie Waters voting against dollars (being given to us with no strings attached from the federal government) that would fund a public awareness campaign to lower risks of heart disease, stroke and breast cancer in women. What are these legislators thinking? \n\nOne more outrage -- and that is for the Times putting this important article on the bottom of the front page so Harry Potter could be at the top of the page. I only care about Harry Potter if some of his wizards would perform magic on the Legislature to make them act more responsibly.\n-- Scott Huffman, St. Petersburg \n\nSnub needs reconsidering\n\nRe: Florida lawmakers snub free money. \n\nOur state lawmakers showed us once again that they waved goodbye to logic a long time ago by turning down no-strings-attached federal money. Why not let our state receive millions in funds for breast cancer awareness, feeding the poor and cleaning up oil spills? The House member who expressed concern about being labeled a \"rubber stamp\" should be more concerned about acting \"dumb as a stump.\" Hopefully, the Legislative Budget Commission will reconsider its decision next month and support Gov. Bush's call to take advantage of these beneficial grants.\n-- Dan Krassner, Largo\nNOTE: Krassner ran against Leslie Waters last year in the Republican primary for the District 51 House seat. \n\nFuture is dim for Florida women\n\nRe: Florida lawmakers snub free money. \n\nIf this is any indication of what the future holds for women in the state of Florida, we had better all move out. Our state Legislature had an opportunity to gain $1-million for the state Department of Health. All the lawmakers had to do was vote to allow the transfer of $59,000 to the Department of Health and the federal government would have sent the state of Florida $1-million to create a media awareness campaign and data collection on heart disease, diabetes, stroke and other health issues in women. The State Budget Commission voted to kill it -- and our very own representative, Gus Bilirakis, voted to kill it. I live in his district, and I would like to know why he would vote down something that would help all of the women in his district? So did Leslie Waters in St. Petersburg. Is this the way they are going to treat women? If so, we (the women) need to defeat them the next time they run for office.\n-- Margaret Hyde, public policy chair, Clearwater Branch, American Association of University Women, Clearwater \n\nHouse members keep it clean\n\nRe: Florida lawmakers snub free money. \n\nLet's see if I understand the issue. House members of a joint budget committee reject acceptance of federal dollars because, in their opinion, state agencies \"did not have a sound plan to spend the money.\" Senate members \"harshly criticized the decision as irresponsible\" because no state money was required. Apparently the senators consider this money \"free.\" Where does it come from? Why, it comes from taxpayers all over the United States. How is it that free? \n\nIt appears to me that spending any tax money without a clear plan of benefit is the equivalent of \"pork barrel.\" Who are providers of pork? I believe we call them \"hogs.\" Who are the heroes in this porcine battle? Why, the House members, \"many of them newcomers to budget committees.\" May these courageous new members, during their terms of service, keep their feet clean by avoiding pig pens.\n-- John Christy Clement, Tierra Verde \n\nA hopeful solution to budget crisis\n\nHow can the state budget crisis be solved? Here is one suggestion. \n\nAbout 80 percent of persons in state prison are confined for offenses involving drugs or alcohol. When a judge sends a person to prison for a drug or alcohol offense, it costs the taxpayers at least $20,000 per year. If most of these persons were given a choice of addiction therapy, or prison, it would be significantly less costly, and much more effective. \n\nI am glad our governor's daughter is getting therapy for her addiction. That is \"restorative justice.\" The courts should be giving that same option to many others who are in lockup. \n\nPrison is appropriate, if a murder or other serious crime is committed by a person under the influence. The vast majority of cases are not that serious. Far too many people are being sent to prison. However, when they are released, recidivism records show about two-thirds will be arrested again within three years. \"Lockup\" does not solve the problem, and the taxpayers are the ones who are punished. \"Restorative justice\" offers hope for the future.\n-- William W. Roughton, Lakeland \n\n"

        "body": "\n\n\n\nMedicaid Swallowing Up State, Federal Budgets\nBy MIKE SALINERO  <mailto:msalinero@tampatrib.com> msalinero@tampatrib.com\nPublished: Jan 21, 2003 \n\n       \n <http://utils.mediageneral.com/RealMedia/ads/click_lx.ads/www.tampatrib.com/news/story.htm/1807/Position1/OasDefault/t_TBO_Pillow_Ad/TATE250b.gif/63663765316338313365326433626430>  <http://utils.media-general.com/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/www.tampatrib.com/news/story.htm@Position1?x>        \nTALLAHASSEE - It was a good idea: Workers pay a small amount of their taxes into a health insurance program for the poor and disabled. \n\nBut the well-intentioned Medicaid program has metastasized into a budget-busting monster, creating migraines for legislatures already struggling with the worst state government financial crises in memory. \n\nAnd in Florida, where today Gov. Jeb Bush unveils what he concedes will be an austere budget, advocates for the state's 2 million Medicaid recipients worry some of those vulnerable citizens will lose care that keeps them alive and healthy. \n\n``The real tragic irony here is that when families need Medicaid most, when the economy softens as it is now, state government is saying we will cut back access,'' said Jack Levine, president of Voices for Florida's Children. \n\nMedicaid budgets, funded jointly by federal and state governments, are exploding under the same unrelenting medical cost inflation that is wreaking havoc with private insurance plans. \n\nIn 1987, Medicaid made up about 10 percent of state budgets. That's grown to 20 percent. In Florida, it's the second-largest item in the budget at a cost this year of $11.4 billion. \n\n``Every hiccup in the Medicaid program is a major stomachache for the rest of the state budget,'' said Len Nichols, an economist with the Maryland- based Center for Studying Health Systems Change. \n\nFlorida Reins In Costs \n\nIn many respects, Florida's Medicaid program is in better fiscal position than most states. The agency has reduced its budget by more than $1 billion during the past four years. The savings were accomplished by restraining prescription drug costs, channeling thousands of recipients into managed care organizations and ferreting out the fraud and abuse endemic in Medicaid programs. \n\nFlorida Medicaid finished fiscal year 2001-02 with a deficit of just more than $10 million out of a $10.1 billion budget. This year, Medicaid Director Bob Sharpe is predicting the agency will wind up with a surplus of more than $11 million. \n\n``I don't know exactly,'' Sharpe said, ``but I suspect there are very few state Medicaid programs that are predicting a surplus for the current fiscal year. ... Right now we're fortunate.'' \n\nDespite Florida's success in reining in costs, the program grew 12.5 percent this fiscal year. And without a major rebound in the economy, Florida could be looking at a similar increase or worse next year. \n\nThe growth in the program is particularly troublesome in a year when lawmakers are scrambling to pay for costly amendments mandating lower class sizes in public schools and a universal prekindergarten program. Last week, Senate President Jim King suggested some beneficiaries might have to be cut as the Legislature looks for ways to plug a potential $4 billion deficit. \n\n``We would love not to have to touch it,'' King said. ``If we do, it will be well thought out.'' \n\nAmong the cuts legislators might consider are in the $368 million Medically Needy program, which covers prescription drugs and other services for people who don't have insurance but don't qualify for regular Medicaid. \n\nThe Legislature also could lower income levels that determine Medicaid eligibility. For instance, roughly 5,800 pregnant women with incomes between 150 percent and 185 percent of the federal poverty level are eligible for prenatal care. For a family of four, that's an annual income of between $27,150 and $33,485. If the Legislature lowers the eligible income level to 150 percent, they would lose those benefits. \n\nLosing Doctors \n\nAnother looming problem is a dwindling physician network. Sharpe said Florida has traditionally had one of the lowest fee-reimbursement schedules in the country. Increases in recent years have not kept up with medical inflation. \n\nSharpe worries the Legislature will decline to make any meaningful increase this year, forcing more doctors out of the Medicaid provider network. \n\n``Probably the most significant problem we're facing right now is sustaining our physician network at the fees we're able to pay,'' he said. \n\nHillsborough County physician Roberto Garcia-Ibanez said reimbursement rates in Florida are laughable. Garcia- Ibanez, an allergist and immunologist, said Texas, where he once practiced, pays doctors much more for Medicaid recipients. \n\n``Here it is a terrible situation,'' he said. ``It's prompted a lot of doctors not to see Medicaid patients, and this is a tragedy.'' \n\nThere are areas in the state where certain types of care are unavailable to Medicaid patients. Levine, the children's advocate, said he met the mother of a child with cerebral palsy who lives in Hamilton County on the Georgia border. The only option for getting her child the care he needs is to put him in a foster home 70 miles away in Gainesville. Even then the care isn't guaranteed. \n\nSharpe said he hopes Medicaid will be able to cover cuts in appropriations this year through further cost controls and leveraging more federal money. Florida has instituted groundbreaking cost controls in the Medicaid prescription drug program that have reduced expenditures by $500 million during the past five years. \n\nBut even with those savings, prescription drug spending continues to grow at 13 percent to 14 percent. Nursing home spending is also on the rise. If Florida's population continues to grow at the same rates as the 1990s, and if it continues to be a retirement haven, Medicaid could easily become a $53 billion program by 2015. That's equivalent to the size of the entire state budget now. \n\n"

        "body": "\n\nGovernor Bush:\n \nIn light of your recent budget announcements regarding higher education spending, and the visit by Tom Huber (Collegis CEO) to the IT Florida gathering last week, perhaps this would be a good time for the State of Florida to form a private/public partnership with Collegis, a Florida technology company, for revenue generation and positive return on investment in higher education technology. See our successful results at a community college in Utah, detailed below.\n \nRegards,\n \nMatt Gomez\nDirector of Media Relations\nCollegis Inc.\n2300 Maitland Center Parkway, Suite 340\nMaitland, FL 32751\n(407) 660-1199 ext. 2504\n(407) 421-9365 cell.\nmgomez@collegis.com\n <http://www.collegis.com/> www.collegis.com\n\n***\n\nSalt Lake Community College more than doubles online coursework enrollments through Collegis partnership\n\n \n\nEnhanced technology services strengthen teaching and learning, raise revenues, reduce costs\n\n \n\nMaitland, Fla. and Salt Lake City, Utah - Jan. 21, 2003 -- Superior technology management services and higher education expertise have helped increase student enrollments, college revenues and overall interest in online education at Salt Lake Community College just one year into a five-year contract with Collegis, the college's technology management partner.\n\n \n\nThe statistics, which were recently presented to the SLCC Board of Trustees, reveal that online programs, known at the college as eEducation, have more than doubled from 3,195 in spring semester 2002 to 7,140 at the end of the enrollment period for spring semester 2003. Course offerings in various subject areas have increased from 130 sections to 353 sections, including a mix of exclusively online and blended (in-class and online) education. An economics course has also been developed and is now being offered online to students in Asia through a partnership between SLCC and Shanghai Teachers University.\n\n \n\nCollegis, based in suburban Orlando, Fla., is the leading provider of comprehensive technology solutions and services to higher education. The corporation's technology management partnership with SLCC has been instrumental in generating more revenues for SLCC by streamlining operations, boosting enrollments, improving campus communications and creating a better learning environment for students at this thriving Utah college. SLCC signed a five year, $26.5 million technology management contract with Collegis in December 2001.\n\n \n\nSince the start of the partnership one year ago, Collegis and SLCC staff members have met the college's strategic goals of working to implement and support appropriate technologies to enhance teaching and learning and to maximize the effectiveness and efficiencies of campus operations. By leveraging Collegis' expertise in higher education technology management, SLCC has also realized significant return on investment (ROI) and great value from the outsourced technology business partnership.\n\n \n\nCollegis upgrades and maintenance to the WebCT course management platform, which includes Web hosting and 24/7 help desk support, have helped save SLCC nearly $1.4 million in cost avoidance of a new platform and ongoing instructional technology assistance fees, according to SLCC. Also, by providing on-site Collegis consultants to oversee the college's recent SCT Banner software migration, SLCC has experienced cost-avoidance savings of nearly $750,000. An estimated $420,000 savings in purchasing and licensing fees over the course of the contract creates further value via the creation of an integrated learning environment, which includes a Campus Pipeline portal and SCT Banner software.\n\n \n\n\"Our strategic goals for this partnership were to improve teaching and learning through the use of technology and to generate revenues through a more innovative and efficient use of technology resources on campus,\" said H. Lynn Cundiff, president at Salt Lake Community College. \"We've been able to accomplish these goals already, with impressive ROI and value from this relationship, and we still have four years remaining to work together and build on this success.\"\n\n \n\nAn eEducation Strategic Action Plan, developed in collaboration between Collegis and SLCC faculty and staff, has been produced to forecast growth opportunities for the next four years of the technology management contract.\n\n \n\nAbout Collegis Inc.\n\nFounded in 1986, Collegis Inc. is a leading provider of integrated strategic advisory, education delivery and technology management solutions to higher education institutions in the United States. The Company's solutions address an array of technology-related issues facing colleges and universities, including institutional strategic assessment and planning, implementation of learning technology initiatives, new curricula design and long-term management of technology resources. The Company's integrated service offering, in contrast to a single-point solution, enables clients to achieve an identifiable return on investment from a strategic, operational and financial perspective. Visit the Collegis Web site at www.collegis.com <http://www.collegis.com/> \n\n \n\nAbout Salt Lake Community College\n\nSalt Lake Community College, which serves more than 54,000 students annually, has active partnerships with about 500 local businesses and school districts to provide a skilled workforce.  The college offers nearly 100 academic programs through its four schools: Business and Industry, Continuing and Community Education, Humanities, and Sciences and Technology. SLCC offers associate degrees with diplomas and certificates awarded for non-degree programs. Visit the SLCC Web site at www.slcc.edu <http://www.slcc.edu/> .\n\n \n\n###\n\n \n\n \n\n"

Operation Step Up utilizes volunteer centers, local emergency management, law enforcement and fire rescue workers in order to recruit volunteers for new training and service opportunities in homeland security and disaster response. \n\nIn December, seven Big Bend area organizations participated in a Disaster Volunteer Reception Center (VRC) tabletop exercise. A VRC is set up in the effected community in the event of a disaster or emergency to greet and register people wanting to volunteer. Using a table size VRC floor plan, participants assigned resources and staff, practiced operating the center and reviewed procedures for recruiting disaster relief volunteers. The exercise was coordinated by the Capital Area Chapter of the American Red Cross in partnership with Volunteer Leon, Florida State University Center for Civic Education and Service, Community Crisis Response Team, Big Bend Disaster Animal Response Team, Humane Society of the U. S. and the Florida Department of State Volunteer Office. \n\nVolunteer Lee (County), in partnership with Lee County Emergency Management, FIND of Lee County and the Salvation Army, hosted a VRC exercise in October. Trainees role-played VRC staff and spontaneous volunteers to be better prepared to utilize an influx of disaster relief volunteers. Volunteer Lee followed up in December with presentations by emergency management and law enforcement on the importance of volunteers in their agencies. Volunteer Lee was awarded $15,000 this year to implement the Disaster Volunteer Management and Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) initiatives of Operation Step Up. \n\nOperation Step Up is a Volunteer Florida program made possible by the Corporation for National and Community Service. Eleven volunteer centers and dozens of emergency response agencies around the state are engaging Floridians in Operation Step Up homeland security and disaster preparedness programs.

The Power of Five is a five-session plan (including activity sheets) that emphasizes youth involvement in delivering the 5 promises (caring adult, safe place, healthy start, marketable skills, and opportunity to serve). \"The best place to find a helping hand is at the end of your own arm.\" This Swedish proverb describes the soul of The Power of Five, encouraging young people to lend a hand to kids in their community. \n\nThe Power of Five asks tweens to do their part in making sure that every young person has what they need to grow up as a happy and healthy successful adult citizen. The activities and instructor's guide will help facilitate the group's efforts as young people evaluate and research their volunteer or service options. They will commit at least five days to fulfilling the Five Promises to kids their age or younger. To learn more about the Power of Five curriculum, visit America's Promise at: www.americaspromise.org/poweroffive. \n\n  _____  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nCongratulations to AmeriCorps Promise Fellow, Laura Lockwood, for being featured in January\u2019s edition of the Chronicle of Philanthropy. Laura was twelve when she founded ManaTEENS, the largest, locally based, youth led volunteer initiative in the country. For more information about the ManaTEENS, visit www.manateens.org.

THANKS!\n \nRebecca\n\n \n\nApril 2, 2002\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMr. William F. Merck, II\n\nVice President Administration and Finance\n\nUniversity of Central Florida\n\n4000 Central Florida Blvd. \n\nOrlando, Florida  32816\n\n \n\n\n \n\nDear Mr. Merck:\n\n \n\nOn behalf of the Sierra Club of Central Florida, and the Sierra Club Florida Chapter, I have reviewed the proposed master amendment for the University of Central Florida (UCF).  We thank you for the presentation of the master plan update and tour of the campus in May of 2001.   Our response is as follows:\n\n \n\n*        Transit, Circulation and Parking Element\n\nThe circulation systems pose a significant challenge to the campus with potential to fragment the east side. We object to Policy 1.17:  a major new parking facility, such as the one envisioned on the east side.   This area is an upland of 10 to 12 acres is used for teaching plant identification.  We support this location for the new greenhouse and future environmental center.  We suggest high usage of multi-modal centers for the western portion of the University, i.e. along the Alafaya Road corridor and near University main entrance. We recommend a study of a mass transit system similar to that of Orlando area theme parks.\n\n \n\n*        We support the binding protection and of the \u201cnatural communities of the arboretum \n\nincluding the scrub site.  I would like to emphasize Sierra\u2019s desire that no further loss of scrub habitat at UCF be considered.  These ecologically diverse communities are located in the Econlockhatchee River Basin designated as an Outstanding Florida Water (OFW) established by Chapter 62-302, F.A.C.  The Econlockhatchee River system is a water designated worthy of special protection because of its natural attributes.  This special designation is applied to certain waters with the intent of maintaining existing good water quality.  Protection of this area will assist in preventing the lowering of existing water quality while preserving and defining the  boundaries of this property.\n\n \n\n*        We object to siting of Greek housing in the Conservation Area of the northwest quadrant\n\n of the UCF campus.  Sierra opposed this proposal in April of 1997, shortly after the Board of Regents approved the plan in 1995.    The Greek housing proposal would impact a diverse area designated as a relocation site for gopher tortoise and Florida mice.  Plant communities consist of imperiled longleaf pine-turkey oak sandhill and sandpine scrub. We continue to support binding protection to sustain the ecological integrity of this upland area.  Sierra\u2019s involvement in the master planning process dates to 1992.  After several years of significant time and resources, Sierra believed the University would truly protect this area.  It is disheartening that the request for private housing has surfaced again.  I understand that in 1997, a process to develop eight possible alternative locations for expansion was under review by the Administration.  I would like to emphasize that Sierra does not support any private housing in conservation areas.\n\n \n\n*        218 Acre Golf Course\n\nThis proposed golf course located on the southeast side of the campus composes 15% of the University\u2019s acreage.  We do not support the location of a golf course on campus.

(\"Because of this, final approval has been delayed since August\").  But \"on Jan 7, the Florida Board of Governors delegated such decisions to university boards\". \nWhich virtually leaves any and everybody impacted by this with no redress. \nThey call it an \"update\" of the 1995 plan---but on the 1995 plan there were 72 acres of \"preserved\" uplands which contained then and still contain federally endangered and threatened wildflower species, and significant gopher tortoise populations which already had been relocated under the blessing of Fish & Wildlife provided that was to be their permanent home:  Where the 2010 plan (\"update\") now shows new fraternity housing is the wild upland tortoise habitat meant to be preserved on the 1995 plan.  And there is, I gather, no lasting inviolable protection for those \"wild preserve areas\" that ARE left on the new updated plan! (This, bear in mind, at a university with a quite significant biology/ecology component.)\nThe sole public hearing on this is Thurs. and they have (it SEEMS) deliberately made it difficult for people to speak at all---even the public notice was in the paper late.\n \nBecause of the new change in the law maybe there is nothing you can do.  And I certainly don't know all the nuances of this---Sue Eberle's grasp of the minutae is far greater and better researched than mine.  \nBut basically it sounds like this plan is being pushed thru over vociferous objections.\n \nI will get those other texts to you ASAP tonight.  \n \nI understand, if it is out of your hands. \n \nIn any event, I appreciate your time very much.\n \n \nRebecca\n\n----- Original Message ----- \n"

And there is a certain exigency to this matter for us---so I hope to get this all to you in time to peruse before Thursday.\n \nAgain, thank you for your time, your patience, and your attention. \n \nSincerely,\n \nRebecca\n\n"

        "body": "\n\nJeb:\n\nAttached (MS Word File) and below you will find a copy of the joint\nposition of the largest possible segment of the environmental community\nconcerning the Everglades phosphorus issue.\n\nThe intent of what you see here is to pursue a truly workable and practical\nresolution of the phosphorus issue - one which will answer the fundamental\nquestion \"what happens when enforcement begins on December 31, 2006?\"\n\nThe bottom line is that should the 10ppb standard not be immediately met in\nthe early days of enforcement (2007) the administration of this standard\nthrough DEP's permit system should require the development and\nimplementation of additional measures to reach further in the direction of\nattaining the standard. We should not stop the process for litigation over\nvariances, and similar controversial \"relief mechanisms\". We should get\nright to the business at hand - improving the discharges, requiring the\npermittees to keep trying until it is done.  \n\nOur friends in the sugar industry are spending a lot of time predicting\narmageddon on December 31, 2006 if a solid 10ppb standard is adopted for\nthe whole Everglades. That is not how we see it; we want and see a path to\ncontinued progress. \n\nSome actual rule language to accomplish the position that is attached has\nbeen forwarded by us to Ken Wright. \n\nWe hope you will help us accomplish this -- rather than the route to\ntrouble and conflict that is being marketed by some of our friends in the\nsugar industry, in which the Everglades would be divided into areas with\nmultiple standards (some of which would sacrifice those parts of the\nEverglades affected) and in which the future would be full of litigation\nover variances, mixing zones and similar \"relief mechanisms\".\n\nCharles\n\n************************\n\nAUDUBON OF FLORIDA\\x81\u0153DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE\nENVIRONMENTAL AND LAND USE LAW CENTER\\x81\u0153 THE EVERGLADES TRUST\nTHE EVERGLADES FOUNDATION\\x81\u0153NATIONAL AUDUBON SOCIETY\nNATIONAL PARKS CONSERVATION ASSOCIATION\\x81\u0153NATIONAL WILDLIFE FEDERATION\nNATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL\\x81\u0153THE OCEAN CONSERVANCY \n1000 FRIENDS OF FLORDIA\\x81\u0153SIERRA CLUB\\x81\u0153WORLD WILDLIFE FUND\n\n\n\nJanuary 21, 2003\n\n\nThe Honorable Jeb Bush\nGovernor, State of Florida\nThe Capitol\nTallahassee, Florida  32301\n\n\tRe:  10ppb Phosphorus Water Quality Standard for Everglades Protection Area\n\nDear Governor Bush:\n\nWe fully support and commend your proposal to the Environmental Regulation\nCommission to establish a numerical water quality standard of 10 ppb\nphosphorus criterion to be adopted by rule for the Everglades Protection\nArea.  We were delighted by Secretary Norton\\x81fs announcement at the\nEverglades Coalition meeting on January 10, 2003 that the Department of the\nInterior also supports 10 ppb.  \n\nThis phosphorous water quality numerical standard was backed by solid\nscientific research in 1994 and has been further validated by subsequent\nresearch.  In the eight years since the Everglades Forever Act was enacted,\nthe Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of the Interior,\nand the South Florida Water Management District have all carried out\nstudies supporting the numerical 10ppb standard.  From 1999 to Jan 2001\nalone, over 110 scientific reports were published that are relevant to an\nEverglades numeric criterion, bringing the number of published science\nreports to over 400.\n\nIt may not be practical or possible for all permitted deliveries of water\nto meet the water quality standard for the entire Everglades Protection\nArea by December 31, 2006 as required by law.  This should not lead to\ndrafting a rule that allows permit applicants to undermine the intent of\nthe law.  Such a rule would be both unwise and unnecessary.  The rule as\nanticipated by the Legislature in 1994 should be a clear science-based\nstatement of a limit based on eliminating adverse impacts.  Issues of\ncompliance can be handled in the permits issued by the Department of\nEnvironmental Protection.  This is in fact what the Everglades Forever Act\nrequires.  It is also what is required by the federal Clean Water Act\ndelegation to the State of Florida.\n\nThe undersigned organizations urge you to support a rule that sets out the\nphosphorous criterion without including provisions related to compliance.\nThe final rule should not contain references to variances, mixing zones,\nand other more uncertain relief mechanisms.  \n\nGovernor Bush, establishing the phosphorous criterion is one of the most\nimportant decisions facing the Everglades restoration at this time.  It\nwill provide the foundation for other major Everglades decisions and\nrestoration activities. We commend your leadership on Everglades\nrestoration and your support of the scientifically sound numerical standard\nof 10 ppb phosphorus, \nThe Honorable Jeb Bush\nJanuary 21, 2002\nPage Two\n----------------------------------\n\n\nand ask for your continued support to establish a rule that will indeed be\nthe basis of restoration of this American treasure.  \n\nSincerely,\n\n\nStuart D.

The 1994 Everglades Forever Act establishes a \\x81gdefault standard\\x81h of 10\nparts per billion for phosphorus in the \\x81gEverglades Protection Area\\x81h, a\nzone comprised of all of the Everglades Water Conservation Areas, and\nEverglades National Park. We support the implementation of this 10 part per\nbillion standard, which will take effect by operation of law on December\n31, 2003, and will begin to be implemented under existing law on December\n31, 2006.\n\n2. The 10 part per billion phosphorus criterion, which was backed by solid\nscientific research in 1994, has been further validated by research\nundertaken by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and South\nFlorida Water Management District in the 8 years that have passed since the\nlaw was enacted. No case of merit has been presented that this criterion\nshould be changed. \n\n3. The clear intent of the Everglades Forever Act was that the phosphorus\ncriterion should be applicable in all parts of the Everglades Protection\nArea. There is no support in the law, and no convincing support in any\nscientific research, to justify more than one phosphorus criteria, or to\nsuggest that the Everglades Protection Area may be divided into different\nzones where varying criteria are applied.\n\n4. Current performance of the \\x81gStormwater Treatment Areas\\x81h (STAs)\nrequired by the Everglades Forever Act demonstrates that with optimization,\nthese facilities can reduce phosphorus in the STA discharges to 15 parts\nper billion or less. With the further application of Submerged Aquatic\nVegetation optimization methods in the STAs, and the prospect of\nestablishing periphyton based cells in or adjacent to the current STAs,\ncompliance with a 10 ppb standard appears to be within reasonable grasp.\nOptimization of Best Management Practices, currently not being done, could\nfurther reduce phosphorus concentrations in farm fields before effluent\neven reaches the STAs, AND should be pursued as a major next step in the\nphosphorus reduction strategy.\n\n5. It is possible, that small parts of the Everglades Protection Area will\nreceive discharges somewhat greater than 10 parts per billion after the\nDecember 31, 2006 compliance date in the Everglades Forever Act.  This is\nneither justification to alter the standard required to protect the\nEverglades, nor justification for \\x81gvariances\\x81h, \\x81gmixing zones\\x81h or other\n\\x81grelief mechanisms\\x81h which provide an open-ended waiver of enforcement of\nthe 10 ppb criterion. The Everglades Forever Act includes two features that\ndeal with non-compliance situations.  First, the Act rules out \\x81g\\x81c\"Mixing\nzones, variances, and moderating provisions, or relief mechanisms\\x81c\\x81h for\nphosphorus. Next, the act establishes a special kind of permit, known as a\n\\x81gLong Term Compliance Permit\\x81h.  In the event that discharges anticipated\nunder this permit will not meet the phosphorus criterion, the permittee is\nrequired to develop a plan for achieving compliance, cost estimates for\nthat plan, a funding mechanism for the plan, and a proposed schedule for\nimplementation. Reliance on this process already in the law obviates the\nneed for variances, mixing zones, and other more uncertain relief\nmechanisms.\n\n6. In the proceeding now before the Environmental Regulation Commission\n(ERC), we advocate that a straightforward 10 part per billion criterion be\nadopted as a rule. If a majority of the current membership of the ERC\ncannot support approval of a rule establishing 10 ppb criterion in the\nabsence of additional rule language that attempts to allow blanket\nvariances, mixing zones and similar broad  \\x81grelief mechanisms\\x81h with\nuncertain outcomes and deadlines, then the Department of Environmental\nProtection should terminate the rulemaking proceeding it initiated, and\nrely upon the 10 part per billion default standard which is present in the\nlaw.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nmail2web - Check your email from the web at\nhttp://mail2web.com/ .\n\n"

What about when you answer a question, but when they repeat it, it is \ncompletey different... Are you surprised? Do you feel abused? Or is it fair \nbecause of the law..... What is your opinion on that? THE PRESS SOMETIMES KEEPS ASKING THE SAME QUESTION TO TRY TO GET THE ANSWER THEY WANT. THIS CAN SOMETIMES BE A GAME.

I DON'T LIKE SHODDY JOURNALISM.\n5.  If a scandal were to occur, do you want to know exactly what happened? \nVery detailed?  If so, do you feel it is okay for reporters to bombard the \npeople about information?  If not, why? IT DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF ISSUE BEING COVERED.\n6.  Should there ever be limits on the press?  On what they say, print, or \neven do to obtain their information? THERE SHOULD BE LIMITS ON THE PRESS LIKE THERE SHOULD BE FOR ALL OF US.

This could be one reason why children like your daughter Noelle have drug problems.   \n=============================================================\nAge Limit For Club Could Fall In Weeks\n\nBy SHANNON BEHNKEN \nsbehnken@tampatrib.com \nPublished: Jan 22, 2003 \n\n\nTAMPA - Eighteen-year-olds could be allowed inside The Amphitheater nightclub in Ybor City as early as the first week of February. \nThe Tampa City Council had denied owner John Santoro's request in June to lift the 21- and-older restriction they placed on his club. But Hillsborough Circuit Judge Herbert Baumann Jr. ruled Jan. 10 that the council failed to prove that lifting the restriction would have an adverse effect on the entertainment district. \n``I'm so glad a fair and impartial person came in and made the right ruling,'' said Santoro, who also owns Club Hedo. \nOn Jan. 30, the council is scheduled to give final approval to lifting the restriction, and the mayor is expected to sign it the next day, City Attorney James Palermo said. \nState law allows patrons 18 to 20 years old inside nightclubs, though they cannot drink alcohol. \nSantoro agreed to only admit those 21 and older when he opened The Amphitheater in 1998. \nThe city council cannot impose such a requirement on bars, but Santoro said it was clear the council would not otherwise approve his zoning application to serve alcohol. \nIn an attempt to curb underage drinking, council members hoped other bar owners would agree to the age restrictions when applying for zoning changes, Councilwoman Linda Saul-Sena said. \n``The trend is to make the requirement citywide,'' she said. \nBut The Amphitheater remains the only club in Ybor City that cannot admit 18- to 20-year-olds. \nSantoro went before the council in May with a new zoning application seeking to lift the restriction. He said it wasn't fair to single out his club and that the age limit cut his profit by about $2 million. \nIn June, the council voted 4-3 to keep the restriction. \nCouncil members have discussed passing an ordinance prohibiting anyone younger than 21 from entering a bar. Palermo has advised against it, saying such a restriction would be unlawful. \nHe said he sent a proposed bill to state Rep. Sandra Murman, R-Tampa, in October that would give cities and counties the authority to set such limits, but he hasn't heard back. \n``I assume it's not something we'll see on this year's agenda,'' Palermo said. \nMiami Beach and Fort Lauderdale have similar ordinances and are fighting for them in court. A Broward County judge upheld the law, but the case is being appealed. \nTampa Councilwoman Mary Alvarez, who favors a citywide restriction, said she is ``disappointed that the court saw fit for the 18- to 20-year- olds to go into the club.'' \n``I don't want to be the big government telling bar owners what to do, but underage drinking is a big problem,'' she said. ``It's always possible for people to buy these underage kids drinks when they're inside.'' \nIt is difficult for bar owners to keep an eye on the underage patrons, Saul-Sena said. \nReporter Shannon Behnken can be reached at (813) 259-7146.\n\n\n"

Inmates have little opportunity to learn a trade or a job skill since most of our prison programs have been cut in the name of efficiency.\n\nIt might mean a toothache because the dental care is backlogged from six months to a year.\n\nIt could mean that medical treatment is withheld, as in the case of my son, delayed until it was too late to operate.\n\nIt means living in a hostile environment because the officers and guards are low paid, under trained, and emotionally stressed.  Being an inmate in Florida means being personally degraded, dehumanized, and threatened by DOC staff with an absolute power that runs unchecked and unquestioned.  \n\nSafety or security only pertains to Correctional officers and staff, concern for safety doesn't include inmates.  Inmates can be raped, or beaten, or gassed, or set up for false charges, and no one in Florida's administration cares.\n\nContrary to the present philosophy of Florida, statistics show that the opportunities for rehabilitation, and how an offender is treated while incarcerated, makes more of a difference to recidivism than length of sentence.  Education, vocational and drug programs are shown to decrease the likelihood of return to prison.  \n\nFlorida continues to enforce serving longer sentences, with less and less rehabilitation.  This has not been effective here, or in other states.  We need to make changes.\n\nMarlene Nolte-Director\n4907 Coral Blvd.\nBradenton, FL 34210\n(941) 794-0197\nhttp://www.starcoast-academy.com/\nStarCoast-a distance learning Academy, Inc.\na not for profit organization\n"

If FIU says we have no money to \"absorb the difference\" then the difference is going to be passed on to students like me and with a tuition hike that could go from 7% to 12% depending on what emotional state our Board of Trustees or the state legislature is in, then I'm really worried.   \n\nI guess I only have one thing to do...dress up in a flamingo costume and promote the Florida Lottery so maybe there's enough revenue to subsidize Bright Futures one more year. \n\nSincerely, \n\nMarlon Font \nFIU \n\nPS - Four More Years! \n\n\n\n\n"

        "subject": "Florida Bar Commission Report on the Legal Needs of Children and the Unified Family Court",
        "body": "\nGovernor Bush, it was my honor to meet you last week at the Cuban American Bar Association Installation. I am accepting your suggestion that I send to you a copy of  the memo that I sent to Rocky regarding the work of many people over the past several years to improve the plight of families caught in our legal system.  I believe that some  of the conclusions are consistent with your agenda regarding families.\n\n\nI was the chairperson of The Florida Bar Commission on the Legal Needs of Children which issued its Final Report in June 2002. As you may know, that report was the result of 3 years of intensive study and research on the legal needs of children in all divisions of our courts. The commission membership included a wide variety of professionals from around the state and in the executive branch. We made comprehensive recommendations regarding confidentiality of children's' and families' records ( a very topical issue - which was addressed comprehensively for the first time in Florida); representation of children, whether by GAL or attorney, depending on their need; the need for treatment and services for children caught in our legal system; and finally, what the Bar can do regarding education of lawyers, the public and the judiciary. A large part of our work also involved a study of the need for coordinated technology between the Courts and the state agencies to better serve children.\n\nWe looked at children that are not only in the juvenile courts but in all divisions including domestic violence, criminal, civil, probate and domestic relations. What we discovered is that often children are in several courts because their families are in several courts and we are treating the family problems in segments rather than approaching the needs of the entire family to both serve them and the children in continuing in some family fashion in the future.\n\nThis 3 year study is contemporaneous in time with the work of the Family Court Steering Committee which proposed a model family court/unified family court to the Supreme Court which they adopted in May 2001. The opinion is at 794 So.2d 518 (Fla.2001) \n\nThis unified approach to family problems means that the jurisdiction of the family court includes juvenile, domestic violence, child support and domestic relations cases. It also means that whenever possible, no matter through what portal a family may enter the system, we try to coordinate their cases before one judge. At this time, there are pilot projects in courts throughout the state that are attempting to implement this model. We have also started one here in Dade County, in which I am involved. For example, in our pilot project, we have identified 1400 children in a 6 month period that had more than 2 cases in the system - that equals at least 2800 cases( could be a child support/paternity; dependency/paternity; dependency/dissolution/domestic violence, etc)\n\n\n So far, by bringing all of the family's problems together before one judge, we are able to have comprehensive, coordinated outcomes so that families leave the system with their own solutions rather than court imposed. In other words, the Model Court minimizes the use of the traditional adversary system. It also attempts to coordinate the limited resources that are available in communities and reduce the number of times that people need to appear in court.\n\nThere is a newly created Steering Committee on Children and Families in the Courts created by Chief Justice Anstead and Secretary Regier is on that committee as am I.  That committee is charged with the responsibility to implement the unified court principles and practices.\n\nI really believe that these efforts of looking at the problem of the whole family is part of strengthening families. If they are not going to stay together as couples, then they can at least learn how to meet the needs of their children living separately.  One of the guiding principles of the unified family court is to \" focus on the needs of children who are involved in litigation, refer families to resources that will make their relationships stronger, coordinate their cases to provide consistent results, and strive to leave families in better condition than when they entered the system.\"  This goal is based upon the feeling that a fragmented legal system damages families and a coordinated system conserves community resources and avoids duplication of services. \n\nI have previously sent to your office (by snailmail) a copy of the Florida Bar's Final Report. Here is  the link to the website which includes the full report and lists the members who served on the Commission.\n\nhttp://www.flabar.org/tfbtemplates.nsf/newwebsite?openframeset <http://www.flabar.org/tfbtemplates.nsf/newwebsite?openframeset&frame=content&src=/tfb/TFBComm.nsf/6bfd54554e7b35f185256728004f5220/5f83483031baa09a85256b2f006ca304?OpenDocument> &frame=content&src=/tfb/TFBComm.nsf/6bfd54554e7b35f185256728004f5220/5f83483031baa09a85256b2f006ca304?OpenDocument\n\nIf I can provide any further information about either of these topics, I would be happy to do so. Thank you for your time and interest.\n\nSandy Karlan \nCircuit Court Judge \n11th Judicial Circuit \n\n\n\n"

Bush,\nPresident of The United States of America\n\nDear President Bush:\n\nIn all humility, my prayers are with you that you are successful in all you do and the wishes and desires of your heart are fulfilled and realized with Good.\n\nI am urgently and respectfully proposing and requesting a Consulting Agreement with the United States as a Client at the earliest possible date.\n\nThe Biowar Interactive Early Warning and Security Defense System (the \"System\") was submitted in 1997 during the Clinton Administration to be appropriately and properly implemented and make America ready with a secure homeland defense, then, and it has not been implemented or presented to you, yet, but rather misappropriated and set-on the improper track. It may be too late to perform its appropriate and proper implementation before the next Biowar attack, if we do not act, now. As the proposed system protected individual privacy, as well, its delay has caused the Bush administration and the American public terribly severe and unnecessary headaches, worry and disunity at a time when America and America's president deserve responses and solutions building for unity and security. It is time to shake off the hangover of cool idleness and indifference of the last administration and to stand up to the job of putting in the right defense for America and her allies.\n\nThe Biowar Interactive Warning System as proposed is believed far faster (over 200% plus) and more pervasive than the new Bioterror Monitor technique announced, today.\n\nKnowing, of course, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, there can be no guarantees, the Biowar Early Warning System as proposed, before and now, appropriately and properly implemented,  would, in all humility and modesty (1) provide you, Mr. President, your Counterproliferation Technology Coordination Committee, and American and her Allies, with the necessary, but missing and critically vital  earliest real-time instrumentation revealing subtle suspicious vital life sign deviations among vast populations (2) while protecting and enhancing the privacy rights of the people, (3) and enabling the greatest in-time response for the most effective deterrence and mitigation protecting Americans and America's allies. But, the Biowar Early Warning and Defense System is still delayed since March 31st, 1997, by the hang-over from the prior administration, while America is facing its greatest terrorists risks. It was on or about that date I submitted a Proposal for the System to DARPA\n and others in the Clinton Administration by which I provided The Biowar Interactive Early Warning System White Paper forecasting the likelihood of sneak anthrax and other sneak biowar attacks against Americans and America's allies' and their populations. The Biowar Early Warning System was proposed for implementation in 1997 as the only suitable instrument  to begin protecting Americans and America's allies against the unwarranted risks perceived to  exist at that time and shown to have been, unfortunately, all too correct.\n\nThis is an e-mail re-proposal, delayed by disruptive circumstances (1) respectfully and urgently requesting an Initial Consulting Agreement for an even improved Biowar Interactive Early Warning System, recommended by Dr. Nancy Miller, (former) United States Air Force Acquisition and Program Manager, set out below, together with John F. McCarthy, Jr, attorney, a key partner in America's and the world's largest labor law firm practicing exclusively in America, (2) including a One Page Summary, attached, and (3) an e-mail letter to an attorney (MZ) (sent by separate forwarding) describing the current situation, in which almost five (5) years after submission, finally, by letter Dated January 4, 2002, Dr. Anna Johnson-Winegar, Ph.D., with whom I first had contact at Chemical/Biological Defense in 1999, thanks me for...\"...(your)...support of the DoDChemical and biological Defense Program and for the welfare of U. S. Military forces..\" as I had been continuing attempts during the Cl\ninton administration to gain implementation of the Biowar Early Warning System before American lives and resources which would be saved, were tragically lost. Dr. Anna Johnson-Winegar's response was most revealingly and perhaps with all due respect to her, courageous, as regarding one of the several continued submission's during the Clinton administration and well before the September 11, 2001 attacks. She disclosed that the Department had been only involved in a process for \"..identifying outbreaks of non-battle related illnesses for the deployed soldiers...(and)...also working closely with civilian public health services as they develop methodologies..\" but nothing more and nothing had been mentioned to have been  conceived or implemented for the comprehensive Biowar Early Warning and Defense System implementation proposed by me as an integrative contractor to provide the American population and those of America's allies with the comprehensive deterrence and mitigation protec\ntion offered by the System which was offered during the Clinton Administration in 1997. Now, once the tragedy of September 11, 2001, and the time related anthrax deaths occurred, Dr. Anna Johnson-Winegar is quoted as saying \"shame on us\" for not acting earlier. Indeed. So they have announced they will do something, now, after receiving repeated proposals to provide the System and after September 11, 2001, occurred, by using the trade secreted ideas/concepts without consent of the proponent and by  spending $300,000,000 on it, but, they are admitting they do not have a model, only the ideas I tradesecreted and submitted. Moreover, they admittedly do not know how to implement it and, as a consequence they are running late, on the wrong path, and causing the Bush administration and America great unnecessary problems and greater risks.\n\nLet American's admit we can no longer be tied to the prior administration's continuing hang-over of inaction and methods of denial resulting in no defense or a sham defense from which the Bush Administration will have to dig out.\n\nIf given a chance, I will go forward as the owner of the intellectual property and the author of and one who presented it trade secreted, with a good tradesecreted model to provide the Bush administration and the American people and America's allies better humanitarian and ethical safeguards, better public acceptance, better public appreciation and better implementation than evidenced by the languishing years of the prior administration's fiddling.\n\nPlease allow me to help in response to your assessment, Mr. President, that..\"..The United States has a critical need for cutting-edge technology that can quickly and effectively detect, analyze, facilitate interdiction of, defend against, defeat, and mitigate the consequences of WMD (weapons of mass destruction)...\" The Biowar Interactive Early Warning and Defense System, properly implemented will help you do that better than otherwise possible giving you more time to breath, as did the Integrated Approach for the New York Times I presented resulted in a milestone for the world's greatest newspaper in the management of electronic news records.\n\nMy e-mail address is the most reliable contact as I am some distance from Washington, DC.

The opportunity is capable of much stronger presentation than this e-mail allows.\n\n     This is believed to be the case due to 1) my prior tradesecreted and proprietized proposals, and 2) current competing actions by two (2) of the government authorities utilizing the tradesecreted proprietary intellectual property:\n\n     1) I made documented trade secreted, proprietary, confidential and copywrited proposals:\n\n     a) forecasting the likelihood of sneak anthrax and\nchemical/biological and other attacks against    American citizens and interests, \n\n     b) proposing as a defense and deterrent the \"The BioWar Internet Interactive Early Warning and Defense System Module of the Confidential Computer Patient Record\" in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001 to several potential customers/clients, including, without limitation, key portions of the United States\nGovernment....\n\n   ....The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) March 31, 1997 - A White Paper for the BioWar Early Warning System  to Larry DeBois and the  Director of The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) detailing the likelihood of chem/bio attacks, including anthrax and the benefits of the system as a deterrent and life saving device;\n\n   ....1997, 1998, 1999 Mark Weisman (spelling ?), Contract Director, Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services and Center For Disease Control (CDC) Dr. Koplan's (spelling?) Office under HHS; Parenthetically, Dr. Krakauer, after writing\nthe recommendation of my firm for the Computer Patient Record, was promoted to Policy Advisor to the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services; and,\n\n   ....1999, and 2000 and 2001, Office of The Secretary of Defense to DoD Chemical and Biological Defense and Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA)  Acting Director Walling to Anna Johnson-Winegar, Ph.D., Office of the Assistant To The Secretary of Defense, Nuclear and Chemical And Biological\nDefense Programs, Deputy for Chemical/Biological Defense.\n\nNone acted. Johnson-Winegar did not respond in writing to the 1999 proposal in which others in DoD said it was badly needed in Kuwait and Egypt, for starters, but only after a diligent Col. Walling wrote in a November, 2001 letter of acknowledgement, did she acknowledge the 2001 proposal in a letter dated Jan 4, 2002, saying \"Thank you for the White Paper on 'Biowar Internet Interactive Early Warning and Defense System Module of the Confidential Computer Patient Record\", \nwanting more details of the workings of the system; however, sufficient had been given for them to begin with a first ever effort beginning as early as 1997.\n\n\n     2)Now after sever criticism following September 11, 2001, on August 27, 2002, Pamela Hess UPI Pentagon Correspondent in a UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL (you may wish to see it by downloading it from UPI's site: A:\\United Press International DC to get bio-attack warning system.htm) Press Release entitled:\n\n\"DC to get bio-attack warning system\" reports \n\n\"-- Washington, Albuquerque, N.M., and two other cities will get an experimental \"medical surveillance system\" this fall and winter to track diseases in hopes of identifying a biological attack before \nit reaches epidemic proportions, Pentagon officials told United Press International Tuesday.\"\n\n\"The $300 million, two-year pilot program is sponsored by the Defense Department\"\n\n\nand quotes  Ph.D Winegar as saying...... \n\n\"We all recognize this is something we need to do....it has been less than robustly supported. It; a matter of competing priorities. A lot of people had put a biological terrorist attack in the hypothetical \ncategory until last fall. Shame on us.\"\n\nIndeed. And, for more than one reason.\n\n\nShortly after this report, it was reported that CDC, also severely criticized for not being prepared, has (see the Boston Globe, within the last several weeks days: US PLANS A SYSTEM TO DETECT BIOATTACK\nPublished on October 3, 2002. Author(s):    Stephen Smith, Globe Staff) granted $1.2 Million to a Harvard medical team for a similar project. CDC had negotiated over and received the trade secreted materials and proposals in 1997-1998, and more.\n\n\nMy point, here, in all humility, is not to now push for a controversy resolution with these two groups, but to submit the following observation and activity:\n\n1. Observation. The proposal and its seminal proprietary and trade secreted idea has been recognized and acted upon (with \"shameful\"\ntaint, admittedly) by two (2) of the several contracting authorities receiving validating its worth as an over-due expenditure of $300,000,000.00 US Dollars for 4 US Cities. Over 1000 US Cities of significant size and more are vulnerable, not to\nmention the world market, on a year by year, day by day, basis;\n\n2. Observation. They have, in my humble opinion, at least three (3) potentially significant deficiencies  which we may be able to help everybody overcome:\n\n   (i). It appears the allegations of violation of rights of privacy by certain media and the related constitutional rights of US citizens may have more considerations necessary for the administration to be comfortable and that our system would ameliorate that to the administration's benefit. Our system does that in a, in my humble opinion, most desirable way; and,\n\n(ii). Their methods of (a) implementation, (b) doctor acceptance, and (c) analysis, as well as (d) systemic composition are potientially flawed and leave unnecessary room for others to criticize the administration, when, in fact if presented properly the administration would have positive public relations with the same effect and avoid the insufficiencies as to the (a), (b), and (c) aspects and avoid sending civil rights groups up the wall as to the (d)aspect, in my humble opinion.\n\n3. Submitted activity. A contract to provide our system to say, The State of Florida, Univ of Fla, possibly, New York (and, perhaps others, The State of Texas, California, etc., for openers)with all the safeguards, economic benefits to those States and their citizenry, universities and doctors \nand health care professionals,  would permit us to activate the desirable alternative and then speak with our rivals concerning proper and beneficial roles in a consortium.\n\nTime of course is of the essence. Of course there are several items best for direct discussion, including research on specific contact points to implement, in all humility, the proprietary first-class complete system addressing concerns of the largest population groups.\n\nWeb sites detailing information are at:\n\n               stephenalrothshchild.tripod.com\n\n                   and \n\n               angelfire.com/super/aim\n\n\nCDC Harvard $1.2 Million/ Page A 1 Boston Globe 10/3/2002 by Stephen Smith at the Boston Globe. \n\nUS Plans a system to detect bioattack.\n\n\"The CDC is committing $ 1.2 Million to the trial of the computerized surveilance network....The technological proof-of-concept is recommended by Dr. Nancy Miller, former USAF Program Acquisition Manager and scientist, along with other top experts as real, now.\n\nPlease put me in contact with the necessary parties and advise what I may do to clarify any necessary matters and make any necessary adjustments that will facilitate our proposal meeting with success.\n\nBenefits to the  Clients and Others.\n\n1.\tHow many people in the USA would benefit from the project? \n\n2.\tThe entire United States population of approximately two hundred eighty million persons (280,000,000) would ALL potentially benefit \nfrom the Clearinghouse projects of the Biowar Early Warning System, The Computer Patient Record Management System, The Media Risk Management System and the Monetary Risk Management System.\n\n3.\tWhat are the potential benefits to the State of Florida, New York, others and their citizens and Associates? \n\n4.\tPotentially,..Unlimited...Becoming the global leader in bringing dignity and integrity in Humanitarian Medical, Media and Monetary Risk and Flex-management, including, without limitation, anti-terrorism and electronic information management. Potentially the $250 Billion Dollar US Domestic Market will yield 25 Billion Dollars to Florida, New York \nin gross revenue cash flow for each ten percent (10%) market share of the US Doctor's Paper-less Office Market, (the most stable and inelastic segment of the US economy), not to mention the balance of the global market and the remaining elements of the Clearinghouse. \n\nAs mentioned, there are numerous recommendations and references, including, without limitation, Dr. Nancy Miller, former United States Air Force Project Acquisition Manager whom, among her many achievements, performed dual use (commercial/governmental) activities with the US Government and M. D. Anderson.   Dr. Miller's recommendation is to be found \non the \"Angelfire\" web-site set-out, below.\n\nWe would utilize the same tried and true Integrated Approach Technology business model I developed for use at the New York Times utilizing an Integration Agreement to bring together the necessary \ncapabilities for successful completion of a very simple proof-of-concept, implement it and make it available, globally.   At the New York Times, this was accomplished by converting a New York Times printing \npress into a \"new\" press, and then implementing the process throughout the press line, making it available globally, this resulting in modernizing the New York Times (successfully competing against the world's largest merchant banks) and successfully launching and completing the Initial Public Offering on Wall Street of the integration company I formed which was taken public by Bear Stearns. There it was the management of electronic news records. Here, it is the management \nof electronic medical records and I am respectfully asking your help to launch the activity with you and New York State, implement it and make it available, globally. That means an Integration Agreement \nto bring together the capabilities (you and New York State, et. al.) necessary to complete the simple \nproof-of-concept which we know to be eminently doable with existing technologies, and then implement it, making it available globally.\n\n     The activities now available would include a BioWar Interactive Medical, Media and Monetary Risk Management Clearinghouse beginning with the defense of Anthrax and Germ/Chem warfare, together with the $250 Billion Dollar US Doctor's Paper-less Office Market made available globally, to defend the USA and its allies, Israel, and others. Hebrew University and associated hospitals and others, here, in Israel and elsewhere, would be available to join Florida, New York along with other great states and universities. These activities would benefit every man, woman \nand child in American - all 280 million souls.\n\n                           \n                      Very respectfully,\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Steve\n                      ________________________\n                      Stephen A.

Also, a Beach Patrol that is \"fed\" quality people by a Junior College curriculum similar to one the USLA certifies at Miramar College in California http://www.miramar.sdccd.cc.ca.us/ , but with the added aspect of Paramedic Certification to produce a true EMS Certified Paramedic/Ocean Lifeguard.  Chris Brewster bcb@compuserve.com , National Certification Officer,  during his visit to Pensacola http://www.wear3.com/news/Stories/august/0821/lifesaverspbeach.htm (and) http://www.pbrla.com/news_08302a.html has already offered to arrange the liaisons with Miramar for Sandra Hartley who heads the Paramedic Program at Pensacola Junior College.\n \nThe interest in such an educational program is very high on a state, national and international basis.  We have ALL of the elements here in Pensacola to launch such a curriculum.  I will support this effort with time, voice, and money; any time, any where.  \n \nI am pleased to announce that the Santa Rosa Island Beach Patrol, Inc. has been incorporated as a Florida not-for-profit corporation.  I am now working with my CPA and attorney to structure the budget, Federal Non-Profit status, By-Laws, Board of Directors, etc.  I would like to ask you to support me in this great step and huge effort necessary to create this vehicle.\n \nIt is not my intention to confront the Santa Rosa Island Authority(!) over jurisdiction over the beach.  They are only able to provide coverage over a very small portion of the beach as it is, and no plans or method of which I am aware, to extend protection to the hotels and condo's or private property.  \n \nI expect 1 to 3 years of organizational and preparatory work before the SRIBP will be in a position to assume responsibilities.  I do believe that there will be a NEED by hotels and condo's on the island for Beach Protection services by that time, if not before.  My desire is to make very sure that things are done correctly, accurately, and are well planned and organized to continue in perpetuity guaranteed by an endowment.  I submit that there will be beaches and people who both will need protecting long after all of us are gone.  The organization of the SRIBP will provide a vehicle to take beach safety into the future in ways not now envisioned or currently practiced.  A Public/Private Consortium is the best vehicle.  Such PPC's are being used in Canada for SAR and Beach Safety.  The PPC offers the ability to accept both public and private funding, and serve both public and private beaches under both public and private contracts.\n \nI encourage each of you to stay in touch with me and each other.  Ask of me anything, if it will contribute to making our beaches more safe.  I thank you for all of your encouragement and support.\n \nI remain,\nMy Son's Proud Father -\n \nJack Moran\n \n \n \n \nNotice:\nThis e-mail is privileged and confidential, and it is intended to be delivered to, and read only by the addressee(s) named in the original transmission.

Whatever you mean I respect your 1st amendment right and I respect your leadership.  However, in perilous times you merit vigilance then why do you refuse to help my child?  If Dr. Haney were to examine the state of \"peril\" he might, much like the international press, state that you are exaggerating and suffering from Munchhausen by proxy.  Thank God we both know Dr. Haney is inaccurate.  \n\nIt would seem that we should take care of each other before we embark on a war.  Hungry soldiers do not fight well, they just desert well.\n\nThe point of the e-mail is that I was home taking care of my son and I was not at a rally.  Despite the headlines in about 15 international papers I have not spread the news of our \"arrogant\" international reputation.  I just take care of my son and attempt to access services for him; just a Mom not a radical.  Conversely, the conduct of some of your administration is and will remain quite alarming.  All families and children should be able to protect themselves from reasonable harm including Dr. Haney.  A lot of state employees got nice fat pay stubs to deny my child services and I do not think that is what you want.  Dr. Haney is your problem as he is every Floridians' problem.  Our family sincerely does not want to fight this out we just need for our child to get the services without all the hassles.  Respectfully we request that my entire record be cleared as the accusation of abuse was retaliatory and will prevent me from working within my chosen field of special education.  I worked very hard for my Master's Degree and the abuse charge renders it absolutely useless.  I hope you read Olmstead v. L.C.\n\nOlmstead makes some very good points that are relevant to this case.  One more thing while I have you, could you please instruct your employees to sign their own names, use their own letter heads, quit blaming each other, stop forging parents names, and actual do their jobs.  Four years ago I would have thought this a foregone conclusion but today I think you need to remind state employees to act with integrity and inaccordance with their job descriptions.  It would seem state employees lack the knowledge to adequately perform their jobs.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration,\n\nElizabeth Siebert MS\n\nTHIS E-MAIL IS INTENDED FOR GOVERNOR BUSH IF YOU HAVE RECEIVED THIS IN ERROR PLEASE FORWARD IT BACK AND CALL 772-562-3075 AND THEN DESTROY ALL COPIES OF THE MISAPPROPRIATED DOCUMENT.

That invitation will be sent to you shortly.\n \nI am also President of Stratner Company, a professional services firm focused on improving the business value of technology.  In your comments at the reception, you mentioned that you were going to hire a \u201cchange manager\u201d to help lead your efforts to transform state government to operate in a more business manner.  I may be able to help you.\n \nThroughout my career of some thirty-five years, I have guided organizations, both large and small, in changing and improving their business practices.  Some examples include:\n*         Implementation of formal project management methods for a major New England bank (historically, banks had not managed projects).\n*         Design and implementation of product management practices to create \u201cgeneral managers of a product business.\u201d\n*         Implementation of project management methods for a large insurance company.\n*         Management of global business practices for a mid-sized telecommunications company.\n*         Creation of \u201cbusiness-savvy\u201d engineers for a large, global computer systems company.\n*         Formal study of \u201cThe Management of Worldwide Strategic Alliances\u201d as part of a graduate program at INSEAD, a leading business school in Fontainebleau, France.\n \nMy career includes executive positions in business unit general management, IT management and business infrastructure.

The seminars focus on the importance of communication and managing stakeholder expectations, in addition to explaining the business and product life cycles and how to define markets (both for externally-focused products and for internally-focused services).  Additional information is available at my website, www.stratner.biz.\n \nBeyond what I can imply from your comments at the reception, I am not sure exactly how you plan to proceed.

I was very much  surprised that there was a Citizens Corp organized in Florida.  No one has ever contacted us. We have the oldest (27 years) and largest over (800,000 residents) involved in Neighborhood Watch programs. We also implement Youth Crime Watch of Miami-Dade programs in all the schools, funded by MiamiDade School Board. We are a 501c3 nonprofit, funded by MiamiDade County, we are housed in one of the Miami Dade Police building and work with all the Municipalities (30). We also have an Early Start program, funded by the Governors Drug Control Office.  I did notice that Miami-Dade is listed as a Citizens Corp Council and the contact is thru the County Emergency Management. Obviously, there is a lack of communication, for we have never been invited to participate as a component. I would like our organization to be considered and would like to be listed.

        "body": "Cc:\tmwllog@aol.com\n\nDear Governor Bush,\n\n     Congratulations on your victory last November!  \n\n     I teach Political Science at Valencia Community College-East Campus in Orlando, Fla. In addition to my U.S. Government classes, I have designed and am currently teaching a State & Local Government class this semester. My students are quite impressed with your leadership and quite frankly, so am I. I would like to extend an invitation to you to visit my State & Local class (Tuesday/Thursday 11:30am-12:45pm) and discuss the successes and the challenges we continue to face in the State of Florida.\n\n     On a different note, I have been quite concerned that your brother has not been treated fairly in the press or by certain members of Congress as it relates to the case that has been built against Iraq. That is why I have shown all of my classes the unedited, 31-minute speech President Bush made in Cincinnati spelling out, in detail, the case against Saddam. I must tell you that the response has been overwhelming. At least 75% of the students said they did not understand what Iraq was all about until they saw President Bush's speech in my class. Even some of those who oppose war admitted that President Bush made his case to the people. Many students thanked me for showing that speech. Out of 235 students, only a modest 30 said they did not believe President Bush made his case. Two of my classes are Dual Enrollment classes at Colonial High School. Those high school students thanked me for showing the video because they had heard Iraq was a \"personal thing for Bush's father\". That amazed me. \n\n     I believe in teaching the truth. When my classes last semester discussed your race, it was on a fact-based playing field. They were instructed to watch, or in one case hear, the debates. In each class, even Democrats said that you had a better vision for Florida. I did radio analysis in October and called the race in your favor by a landslide. Some listeners remembered that on election night and reminded me of my prediction. Thank you for making that prediction hold true!\n\n     Please let me know if you are able to speak to my class. I know you have a very busy schedule. I anxiously await your reply.\n\n     Mark Logas\n"

        "body": "\nImportance:\tHigh\n\nDear Governor:\n\n \n\nAs I promised at the CABA banquet, I am writing to you on a very important matter. I have been working with housing for the elderly for about eight years and in particular Assisted Living Facilities (ALFs) in public housing. You visited Helen Sawyer Plaza, a pilot project nationally recognized because it was the first in the nation. ALFs save the government money because they divert elderly residents who qualify for Medicaid and would otherwise be in a nursing home, to the much more economical assisted living facility.\n\n \n\nALFs in public housing need Medicaid Waivers to survive. Three housing authorities have gone out on a limb and are converting, acquiring or constructing ALFs on the expectation that they would receive these waivers. Your Department of Elder Affairs supported a line item proviso in this fiscal year\u2019s appropriation to include the DOEA\u2019s ability to contract directly with housing authorities in Tampa, Pinellas County and Titusville for Medicaid Waiver funds. Additionally, the  \u201cComing Home Grant\u201d sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation works with housing authorities and demonstration projects to meet the goals of the grant, which include project basing Medicaid Waivers. This State grant is in peril without demonstration projects. Secretary White assured these housing authorities that they could proceed with their conversions and the Medicaid waivers would be issued during this fiscal year. Well, the fiscal year is more than half over and the waivers are still tied up in bureaucratic quagmire.\n\n \n\nThese housing projects are not only good for the residents of the State, but they have given Florida national recognition. Besides Helen Sawyer Plaza\u2019s recognition, one of these new projects was written up in the National Academy\u2019s State Health Policy\u2019s recent book on Assisted Living.  Thus, Florida is receiving national attention for this creative way to combine Medicaid and HUD dollars to increase funding for nursing home diversion without any increase in the State\u2019s share of the cost. You can find a more detailed description of the demonstration at http://www.nashp.org/Files/Fl.pdf. \n\n \n\nGovernor, I need your help with the bureaucrats in Tallahassee or housing authorities will never take a chance in the future on any of these projects. Additionally, we stand to lose the Foundation\u2019s matching funds and all the national recognition as an innovator in this important area of meeting the needs of our elderly. Please contact the DOEA and give them a little push in breaking this logjam.\\\n\n \n\nPlease say hello to Columba. I miss seeing her at Jazzercize, but I\u2019ve been too busy with these projects to work out. My husband the judge says hello, too.\n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\n \n\nJosie Ramirez\n\nMIA Management Group, Inc.\n\n305.968.4384 mobile\n\n305.666.1264 office\n\nwww.miaconsulting.com\n\n \n\n"

I apologize for the lateness in contacting you, however, I have been out of town just learned of your interview schedule.\n\nSally Patrenos should, without question, be your next executive director for the Florida Transportation Commission.  \n\nI have had the privilege of knowing and working with Sally since 1978 on a diverse array of issues facing our state and can unequivocally say that she is one of the most professional and outstanding managers with whom I have ever worked.\n\nThe Florida Transportation Commission was created while I was in the Florida House of Representatives, where I served as a Republican Floor Leader and a member of the House Transportation Committee. It takes a strong and effective executive director as well as Commission to achieve the mission of providing leadership in meeting the goals of the Legislature and of Florida's transportation needs.  No matter how vital a governing body, it can only move forward as well as its staff.\n\nYou already know Sally's abilities.  She possesses the traits that are vital to being a servant of the people and to being the strong and effective director which you and your fellow Commissioners demand.  Sally has professional integrity.  She is one of the most effective consensus builders I have ever known.  She is articulate, extremely knowledgeable and effective in the legislative arena. Sally successfully tackles and resolves complex issues, and then boils them down to understandable language.\n\nAlthough Brevard County is now my home, my family is from the Panhandle. Sally has vision, she sees and cares about all of our State, not just one region.  She understands the diversity of Florida, and the challenges and opportunities which come with our State's diversity.\n\nI am now with one of our State's seaports, Port Canaveral, and know how important it is for the Florida Transportation Commission and the Department of Transportation to understand the operations and needs of Florida's 14 deepwater seaports; of how our seaports mesh in the overall transportation goals for Florida, whether moving people or moving cargo, and whether moving it by rail, road, sea, or air.  Without a  full understanding of how all modes of transportation interact, our State cannot move forward or be competitive.\n\nSally has the vision you need in your executive director.  She has the strength to move forward the goals and mission of the Florida Transportation Commission.  She knows how to work successfully with leaders, as well as with staff and  constituents -- constituents we all serve, as they are the residents of our state.\n\nPlease, do not hesitate to contact me if I can provide any other information in support of Sally as your next executive director for the Florida Transportation Commission. You can find no one better for the position or the task ahead.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDixie Sansom\n\n_____________________ \nDixie N.

        "body": "\nDearest Jeb,\n\nIt seems like such a long time since we have seen or spoken to each other although I am pleased that you have kept in close contact with Syl.  He so treasures the long friendship you have had. \n\nLet me begin by saying that you and your family have been in our thoughts and prayers regarding Noelle's situation.  You know that I know better than most what she is going through and I pray that she will be successful in her fight against her substance abuse.  You know that you can count on me should she need someone to lean on.  It seems that a very strange bond is formed by those who suffer similar circumstances and this is no exception.  Columba and you have dedicated your lives to being good parents and the suffering you have endured is almost unimaginable.  It is safe to assume that she will emerge a new and very different but wiser person.\n\nYou may know that President Clinton commuted my sentence two years ago and since then I have dedicated most of my free time to prison reform issues.  I served time with many women, much like Noelle, who became victims of substance abuse and the related problems that accompany this big evil.  Why, 90 percent of the women with whom I served were in prison for drug conspiracy crimes.  \n\nIt is in that vain that I write this email.  I am a member of the Junior League and I am Chair-Elect of the Girls Advocacy Project (GAP) Committee.  The GAP Program is a program developed by Miami-Dade Juvenile Court Judge Cindy Lederman to give female youth offenders an opportunity to change their lives through the association with community based organizations who can offer services to these troubled young ladies.  I was also honored when I was invited to serve on the board of another organization called ArtSpring that brings an arts based curicculum into the women's state prison as well as the GAP Program.  We operate in every Florida facility with the exception of Lowell and Gadsden.  \n\nThe organization enjoyed a good relationship with Rini Bartlett who oversaw the women's prisons before recently retiring.   Our program has been successful at improving an inmate's behavior and self esteem creating an environment that makes the inmate a more positive addition to the general inmate population as well as creating the tools they need as they integrate back into society. \n\nI read with great interest that you had appointed Secretary Crosby and hope that he will bring about positive reforms to the Department of Corrections.  I am writing you to see if you could put me in touch with him or the new person who will be overseeing the women's prisons.  I think it is important for us to maintain a good working relationship with the prison administration at each of the facilities and this can be accomplished easiest if we have the support from the top ranks.  Please let me know what you would suggest as the best possible avenue for us.  \n\nOn a personal note, I want you to know how much I have appreciated your support over the years.  Syl and I learned quickly who our friends are and knew that we could always count on you.  It wasn't easy to live through such an injustice but God knew exactly what he was doing as He provided an opportunity to once again help those less fortunate.  I consider it such a blessing.  Thanks for everything and we hope to see you soon.  Much love, Vicki\n"

        "body": "\nHi Jeb,\n       Congratulations on your appointment of Cynthia Imperato to the bench in Broward.  Cindy is my friend and neighbor, and she will make a fine judge and will not disappoint or embarrass you.\n       I know this is not a fun time for you, as you roll out your proposed budget.  Although, I am not longer in the legislature my phones have been ringing off the hook today.  Of particular concern is the absence of funding for the PACE Program.\n       In 1990, I first brought the concept from Jacksonville to Ft. Lauderdale.  There were no programs strictly for girls in the county.  The program has grown to be the most successful program in the whole Juvenile Justice System.  The state wanted us to create a prevention program for girls, and we did, and are now #1 in Florida.\n       We have graduated over 500 girls in Broward alone since we started the program.  Each of our girls goes on to the Junior College, a college, vocational, or tech school.  This far outpaces the public school system in success.  The Broward County School Board had been holding back 22% or 23% of the school funding that is supposed to follow each student...under the guise of \"administrative costs,\" which is a joke.  Our staff at the Pace Center for Girls does all the paperwork, turns it over to the Area Director, who in turn files it with Tallahassee.\n       Jeb, I know you have extremely difficult choices to make it each category of the budget.  As a former HHS Budget chairman, I had many times when I had to make excruciating cuts, and I do understand, probably better than most, your thought process at this juncture. \n       The Class Size Amendment is over shadowing the state budget, but it is my understanding that it doesn't have to be fully implemented until 2010.  There are other ways of addressing the class reduction teacher/pupil ratio issue without building new schools.  The James Madison Institute produced a paper last month with excellent suggestions regarding the issue. \n       The implementing language has not yet been passed. There is still time to redirect our limited educational resources toward paying good teachers a higher salary to teach longer days, and putting more teacher aides in the classroom.  Thereby, reducing the ratio rather than putting untold dollars into the big black hole of bricks and mortar for new schools.  We are not fully utilizing the physical plants that exist in our school inventories today.\n       I have long felt that MSA's (Medical Savings Accounts) would provide a far more reliable and predictable insurance budget  than the use it or lose it indemnity policies of Blue/Cross Blue/ Shield for our state employees.  At the very least, it should be offered as an option.     The money rolls over year after year, and places the onus on the individual to take better care of himself or herself.  By choosing to stop smoking, exercise, make better choices in lifestyle, the financial benefit and savings enures to them.  There is a catastrophic policy raped inside the account, in the event it should become necessary to use it. \n       If this account were to say cost $3,000 per worker per year, the state could choose to pick up all or match a portion of the cost.  It could conceivably allow the state to offer a shared cost healthcare MSA to our OPS personnel, who presently receive no health options.  \n       We are faced every year with the unpredictable increases from BC/BS.  It affects the budget enormously, and it is strangling us.\n       I wish today, that I had the option to have had an MSA 20 years ago, when I was first elected to office.  I would gladly have shared in the cost each year, knowing I could choose my own doctors, pay for health needs not traditionally covered in our usual policies, and that I would be financially rewarded for taking personal responsibility for my health needs.  I practically never used the BC/BS policy, as the few doctors I would want to use were not included in the PPO.  The state taxpayers expended over $6,000 for my coverage last year!\n       Predicability in a budget item of this magnitude is long overdue.  Please ask Donna what the total cost of the state personnel's insurance program amounts to in the current budget year. \n       Just a few of my thoughts for you to ponder.\n                                                  With warm regards , Debby     \n"

Keep it going.\n\nSOCIAL SECURITY: (This is worth the read. It's short and to the point.)\n\nPerhaps we are asking the wrong questions during election years. Our Senators and Congressmen do not pay into Social Security. Many years ago they voted in their own benefit plan. In more recent years, no congress person has felt the need to change it. For all practical purposes their plan works like this: \n\nWhen they retire, they continue to draw the same\npay until they die, except it may increase from time to time for cost of living adjustments. For example, former Senator Byrd and Congressman White and\ntheir wives may expect to draw $7,800,000 -- that's Seven Million, Eight Hundred Thousand), with their wives drawing $275,000.00 during the last years of their lives. This is calculated on an average life span for each.\n\nTheir cost for this excellent plan is $00.00. This little perk they voted for themselves is free to them. You and I pick up the tab for this plan. The funds for this fine retirement plan come directly from the General Fund--our tax dollars at work! From our own Social Security Plan, which you and I pay (or have paid) into -- every payday until we retire (which amount is matched by our employer) --we can expect to get an average $1,000 per month after retirement. Or, in other words, we would have to collect our average of $1,000 monthly benefits for 68 years and one month to equal Senator Bill Bradley's benefits!\n\nSocial Security could be very good if only one small change were made. And that change would be to jerk the Golden Fleece Retirement Plan from under\nthe Senators and Congressmen. Put them into the Social Security plan with the rest of us and then watch how fast they would fix it.\n\nIf enough people receive this, maybe a seed of\nawareness will be planted and maybe good changes will evolve. WE, each one of us, can make a\ndifference.\n\nHow many people can YOU send this to?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "body": "\nJeb,\n\nThe boys and girls at the Times will be content when you and I are gone and taxes are increased...\n\nGo Bucs.\n\nGod bless.\n\nA Times Editorial\n\nBush's shaky budget\n\nThe governor's budget is rife with counterproductive ''savings'' and tax relief for investors, selling Floridians short. \n\n\n(c) St. Petersburg Times\npublished January 23, 2003 \n\n\"Take that! And that! And that! . . .\" \n\nHe didn't phrase it quite that baldly, of course. But as Gov. Jeb Bush announced his budget Tuesday, it sounded as if he was punishing Floridians for ratifying the class size initiative that he opposed. \n\nThe most pointed cut, an $111-million blow to the universities, took dead aim at the one constituency -- families keen on education -- that was most concerned with the passage of Amendment 9. That's $111-million less for operations even with the 7.5 percent mandatory tuition increase built into his budget. Community colleges, meanwhile, would get less than they need just for enrollment growth. Construction of some of the new public school classrooms would be funded with bond money diverted from the universities. \n\nThe next logical step would be to zero-fund the state's industrial development budget. High technology employers expect and demand a highly educated work force. Florida, which already ranks last in spending per capita on higher education, cannot afford the governor's false economy. \n\nThere are other counterproductive \"savings\" in the Bush budget. To spend less on preventing juvenile crime means costlier prisons in the near future. To cut public transit subsidies for the sake of laying down more concrete is to get the least mileage for the money. No pay raise, but higher insurance premiums, for state employees is a undeserved blow to their morale. Limiting the medically needy program to prescription drugs raises the questions of who will pay the doctors who prescribe those drugs and what will happen to seriously ill clients who need hospital care as well. \n\nBush sought to blame most of this on Amendment 9, saying the people made it \"their number one priority.\" But the budget in fact serves primarily his priorities: less government, fewer taxes. \n\nBut not so neatly as he makes it seem. The $64-million that he'd make the counties pay to detain juveniles until their hearings is a potential increase in local property taxes. So is much of the additional $417-million earmarked to the schools from increases in the taxable value of real estate. \n\nThe juvenile detention cost shift is wrong in every respect. It needs to remain a state responsibility for the reason that it became one in the first place: to guarantee a uniform standard of care regardless of where children at risk happen to live. Nobody ever questioned this priority until Jeb Bush came along. \n\nThe most problematic area of his budget is the notion of a wholesale conversion of trust funds to general revenue. Quite possibly, some funds have outlasted the purposes for which they are earmarked, but no one could seriously say that's true of the affordable housing and environmental land purchase bonds that are underwritten by trust funds from documentary stamps, to name just two examples. To that extent, the governor is balancing his budget on some very shaky assumptions. \n\nAmid so much hardship and damage, Bush would press ahead insensibly with the intangibles tax cut that was delayed on account of the economic aftershocks of Sept. 11, 2001. That reduction, now effective with the tax payments due in January 2004, would cost some $116-million. Coincidentally, that just about matches the proposed cut to the universities. \n\nThe Legislature should either repeal that tax cut or change it to exempt the same number of smaller taxpayers but double the rate on those remaining. \n\nRepublican governors in Connecticut, Georgia, Kentucky and several other states are calling for tax increases to mitigate severe budget cuts that have been forced on them, as on Florida, by the stagnant economy. Nevada's Kenny Guinn is asking for nearly $1-billion, without which, he said Monday, service cuts in health and education would \"produce a devastating effect on every single Nevadan.\" Such an outcome, he said, \"is not a choice for leaders, but a choice of political cowardice.\" \n\nIt sells the people of Florida short to propose on their behalf a budget that imposes so many hardships at the same time it grants tax relief to investors. The Senate, to its credit, intends to hold extensive public hearings on the budget and is willing to entertain tax reforms that could make a more decent thing of it. Unfortunately, neither the governor nor the House seems disposed at this point to listen to reason. But so long as there is life, there is hope. \n\n"

One area where I think, based on firsthand observation, the state has a definite interest, is in the area of peer review. \n \nI have ideas on this, which I can discuss with you next week, but suffice it to say that many doctors and hospitals shy away from aggressive peer review because of the fear of lawsuits (both because of potential plaintiff's suits, AND from the doctor who is potentially being reviewed/punished).  Believe it or not, I really think there should be strong penalties against hospitals and medical staffs when appropriate peer review is not done, and smaller facilities where there are limited specialists available for review should be sending the review outside, where real action could be taken.\n \nI definitely have ideas on this, but have not said anything yet because I want to make sure I'm lock step with you.  \n \nPeer review is THE BEST way to achieve improvement, but the state is currently impotent when it comes to enforcing the statute.  If the docs and hospitals won't properly self regulate, it won't work.  THose who oppose caps will argue there should be equivilent improvements in quality, and herein is where you might be able to deliver the answer to that argument.  \n \nI want to put this issue on the table, but am reluctant to until I gauge your thoughts.\n \nHave a safe trip to DC.

One is to let you know that I now work for the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science. You may email me any time at this address or at bluemarine2370@hotmail.com. I would love to hear from all of you. I was very sad to have to leave FMRI, but I wanted to try and pursue my doctoral degree, and this is the best place to do it. I am working for the professor that I would like to be my advisor, as a research associate (a field and lab tech), and things are going well, although Miami is not really for me. I have to stick it out though! I will not know if I got into the program for a few months. \n\nNow for the second reason I am sending this email. As you all know, we are in for a hard freeze tonight, even down south Florida where we don't usually get freeze warnings. You all know what that holds for our snook. Even though I am not working for the state anymore, I am still committed to this fish and it is what I will be basing my graduate research on. I am so committed that I am helping out my former boss by asking all of the guides and anglers that I knew and were in my region before I left. \n\nSouthwest Florida holds a special place in my heart, as do the snook. I am asking each of you to please communicate with me if you see dead and/or stunned snook. I need to know the location of these snook, as well as an estimate of how many you have seen. There will be someone from each field station of FWC/FMRI collecting the dead snook for age and gender structure studies\u2026it will help us know which fish were most susceptible and where. PLEASE do not collect any snook yourself. \n\nLaw enforcement will be out checking for poachers and you don't want to have to try and talk yourself out of something. FMRI will collect the dead snook, but your reports of the dead or stunned fish are crucial. Please also keep your eyes out for despicable people who are poaching these fish while they are disadvantaged, and DO report them to law enforcement as quickly as possible. Make sure you get FL numbers from the boat or plate # from a vehicle. You are the eyes and ears of this fishery, and we need your help. \n\nYou may contact me at this email address or the one listed above, or call me at 305-361-4782 or 727-403-2084. If I don't answer, please leave a message. You may also contact Ron Taylor directly at 727-896-8626 ext 1510, and leave a message as well, or email him at                 Ron.Taylor@fwc.state.fl.us \n  \nPlease do me a favor and spread the word to anyone I may have missed, and anyone that you know would like to assist. The snook are in for a tough couple of days, and any help on surveying the number of dead are greatly appreciated. Thank you all so much, and please get in touch with me as soon as you are able.

In doing that, I suggest that you give consideration\nto representation from different parts of the state.  If you agree with our\nrecommendation, I can suggest a few individuals that you may want to invite\nto replace those that are obviously not able to attend.\n\nThank you for your continuous support.\n\nAgain, I hope that you can schedule the next meeting for Monday 1/27/03.\n\nBerthy\n============\nOn Mon, 20 Jan 2003 12:37:59 EST Resource2H@cs.com writes:\n  Hi Shelly and Susan,\n  Although our last redesign meeting covered much ground, there was still\n  much that was left undone. I believe this was due to a few main factors\n  and\n  I believe that our meetings have turned into provider forums. We have\n  drifted from the original format. This can be looked at as not\n  necessarily negative, however, the \"playing field\" has become unbalanced.\n\n  I was extremely concerned that there were no consumer representatives\n  there.\n  I believe there are two factors contributing to this.\n  The first is the short notice of meeting. The second is the distance they\n  must travel.\n  Additionally, there are seats left unfilled by family members who do not\n  or cannot attend.\n  In our last meeting, it was asked how many providers, parents, consumers\n  and advocates were in attendance. Interestingly, providers were raising\n  their hands as both advocates (I wish) and providers and parents.\n  I would like to also point out, that although it was requested by Susan\n  that everyone wait until Mercer was finished to make comment, this was\n  ignored by the providers in the audience and the meeting was dominated\n  not by stakeholders, but by audience providers. Mercer facilitated the\n  dominance.\n  The end result was that family members had questions and concerns about\n  the information that was given to us by Mercer, but was not given the\n  time or the opportunity to review and discuss the issues. Notably, the\n  providers from the audience were able to leave early and make earlier\n  flights home at their convenience, and we, as family members who have\n  given a year of time will have to meet again to finish.\n  I realize the difficulty of the situation for you, especially given the\n  topic of rates. I only ask that we, consumers and families be given equal\n  consideration.\n\n  It is impossible for consumers and families to have equal representation\n  when providers can fly up and participate, have the time to review\n  information through their affiliation with FARF with expenses covered by\n  that \"very complex administrative overhead\" that our tax dollars provide,\n  however, most parents and consumers do not have the same resources to\n  attend. I also realize the efforts you have made to give consumers and\n  families the opportunity to participate. Sadly, some consumers and family\n  members cannot take advantage of the opportunity.\n  The point I am making is for the following request or consideration.\n  There are and have been substantial seats dedicated to consumers and\n  parents who remain vacant.\n  If a consumer or parent does not confirm that they will be in attendance,\n  can that funding then go to another parent or consumer who can? This\n  would at least assist with balancing the makeup of the meeting without\n  additional expense.\n\n  I was so disheartened to hear the providers rhetoric, most significantly\n  when one of the largest providers referred to the movement of consumers\n  residences in the context of, and I quote, \"dumping them.\" This is how\n  consumer movement is described, by a person who has applied for state\n  leadership position with DS. This, from a board member of FAR who already\n  has representation at the stakeholders table.\n  It was sickening. And although, he was not a stakeholder, he spent\n  significant time debating and commenting. This from a major provider,\n  with a district that has some of the highest rates in the state, making\n  public comment such as this, without having his comments addressed by the\n  state.\n  Unfortunately, the language used could, I believe, be a reflection of the\n  quality, sensitivity and service delivery consumers experience.\n  How sad for our people.\n  It was painful for the few family representatives who were there to hear.\n\n  Obviously, this provider had become so comfortable with the makeup of his\n  surroundings that he forgot to edit himself.\n\n  Please consider giving additional opportunity to consumers, family\n  members and advocates to participate and make their presence known. We\n  cannot allow this type of thinking and service to continue. I am sorry\n  that I personally did not react more strongly, but to be honest, I was in\n  shock of the statement and plan on addressing it personally as a family\n  member outside of the redesign.\n\n  The extra time you are giving us to work on the issues that were left\n  behind at the last meeting is greatly appreciated by the family members\n  and reflects your dedication to the true intent of the redesign. To\n  provide quality service at fair and equitable rates directed by the\n  consumer's need. I am convinced, that in the end, the consumer will be\n  the first consideration, instead of a truckload of funding to be \"dumped\"\n  at the most beneficial provider site.\n  Thank you so much for all your hard work.\n  Jennifer\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The closing is set for about 2 weeks from now.\n \n \n \n \nI also thought you woould get a kick out of this --\n \n \n\n\n\nThis is a VERY simple way to understand the tax laws \n\n\nLet's put tax cuts in terms everyone can understand. \n\n\nSuppose that every day, ten men go out for dinner. \n\nThe bill for all ten comes to $100. \n\nIf they paid their bill the way we pay our taxes, it would go something like this: \n\nThe first four men -- the poorest -- would pay nothing; \n\nThe fifth would pay $1: \n\nthe sixth would pay $3; \n\nthe seventh $7; \n\nthe eighth $12; \n\nThe ninth $18. \n\nThe tenth man -- the richest -- would pay $59. \n\n\nThat's what they decided to do.The ten men ate dinner in the restaurant every day and seemed quite happy with the arrangement -- until one day, the owner decided to give them a break. \n\n\n\"Since you are all such good customers,\" he said, \"I'm going to reducethe cost of your daily meal by $20.\" \n\n\nSo now dinner for the ten only cost $80. \n\n\nThe group still wanted to paytheir bill the way we pay our taxes. \n\n\nSo the first four men were unaffected. They would still eat for free. \n\nBut what about the other six -- the paying customers? \n\nHow could they divvy up the $20 windfall so that everyone would get his \"fair share?\" \n\n\nThe six men realized that $20 divided by six is $3.33. But if they subtracted that from everybody's share, then the fifth man and the sixth man would end up being *paid* to eat their meal. \n\n\nSo the restaurant owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each man's bill by roughly the same amount, and he proceeded to work out theamounts each should pay. \n\n\nAnd so the fifth man paid nothing, \n\nthe sixth pitched in $2, \n\nthe seventh paid $5, \n\nthe eighth paid $9, \n\nthe ninth paid $12, \n\nleaving the tenth man with a bill of $52 instead of his earlier $59. \n\n\nEach of the six was better off than before. And the first four continued to eat for free. \n\n\nBut once outside the restaurant, the men began to compare their savings. \n\n\n\"I only got a dollar out of the $20,\" declared the sixth man. He pointed to the tenth. \"But he got $7!\" \n\n\n\"Yeah, that's right,\" exclaimed the fifth man. \"I only saved a dollar, too. It's unfair that he got seven times more than me!\" \n\n\n\n\"That's true!\" shouted the seventh man. \"Why should he get $7 back when I got only $2? The wealthy get all the breaks!\" \n\n\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" yelled the first four men in unison. \"We didn't get anything at all. The system exploits the poor!\" \n\n\n\nThe nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up.The next night he didn't show up for dinner, so the nine sat down and ate without him. \n\n\n\nBut when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered something important.They were $52 short!! \n\n\n\nAnd that, journalists and college professors, is how the tax system works. \n\n\n\n\nLets keep that 10th man coming to Florida for dinner.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I commend the author for this fine piece of journalism, but would like to identify one other area he missed which needs to be scutinized very closely for fraudulent activity.\n\nSpecifically, my concern is with organizations that have a hidden mission/agenda such as, the destruction of personal and property rights. To accomplish their agenda and goals they set up fraudulent organizations (smoke screen type operations) and make them appealing and eye-catching to the public. In many cases, they will choose a very sensitive topic, such as animals, birds, or mammals, which obviously are near and dear to everyones heart, especially our seniors and children. These scam artists are great at manipulating data and information to satisfy their agenda and in most cases  their data is deceptive. One organization even set up an adoption agency so that for a annual fee you can adopt one of  their \"whatever\"(it's big and lives in the water), but I'm not sure what happens upon the death of this gentle giant, but I'm sure they have another one you can adopt if that happens. I don't think that these gentle giants are really theirs to put up for adoption in the first place. Correct me if I'm wrong, but this sounds like fraud to me.\n\nMost of these organizations file for 501(C)(3) status which allows them to be a tax exempt non-profit organization, but if the truth was known, my guess is that they are far from being non-profit. It's truly mind-boggling how these organizations have the undivided attention of our government services (USFWS & FWS). But after reading about the ENRON's and TYCO's,  It shouldn't surprised me and I should just accept it as unlawful common business practices which we witness more and more each day in this great country of ours.\n\nLet's make 2003 the year that we eradicate these phony outfits, by writing our officials in Washington,D.C. and Tallahaassee and inform them that you are sick and tired of all the lies and deception that these organizations disseminate.\nIts time to de-rail this runaway freight train. I'm suggesting a \"full court press\" (100% Audit) of these organizations financial status and compliance with the tax exempt 501C(3) requirements with a published written report on the findings. Let's start with the SMC (Save the Manatee Club). Our state government owes the citizens and taxpayers an explanation and proof that these organizations are in  compliance with the 501(c)(3) requirements. Tax-exempt non-profit organizations categorized under IRC 501(c)(3) in federal law are generally permitted to \"lobby\" to some extent, but are absolutely prohibited from engaging in \"political activity\". My opinion is that they have many of our politicians in their back pockets and I call that fraudulent.\n\nAl Budd\n3151 York Rd\nSt James City, Fl   33956\n239-283-1294   \n\n\n"

I know you are very busy, so I will do it on a \u201cbullet basis\u201d.\n \n1.  Our transportation infrastructure in South Florida is being outpaced by growth.  \n     \ni.e.)       a. From 1982-1999 population increased 42% and commuter miles 62%.\n             b. For every increase in 5 people, 6 vehicles are registered.\n             c. Time spent in congestion increases currently at 14 % a year.\n \n2. For the first time in history the county commissions from each of Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach have unanimously agreed on something and that is to face the transportation problem \u201cas one\u201d and erase the invisible political barriers on an equal basis.\n \n3. The three County Commissioners have agreed that the quickest way to work together is to transform the existing Tri-County Commuter Rail Authority into the Regional Transportation Authority\u2026same board make-up\u2026same staff\u2026no new bureaucracy.\n \n4. The Tri-Rail Mission would incorporate rail, cross county bus, and regional transportation land use planning such as the FEC Railroad Corridor.\n \n5. Funding the expanded role of this renamed agency would be accomplished by a $2.00 surcharge added to each vehicle registration.  This fee would be levied only upon approval of the Three County Commissioners as would be authorized by the State Legislature.  The County Commissioners have unanimously agreed to do this if the Legislature allows it.\n \n6.This $2.00 surcharge would raise approximately $4.8 Million dollars, and creates a \u201cdedicated source of revenue\u201d required by the Federal Government to be eligible for Federal Transit Funding.  Leveraging this money could represent hundreds of millions of dollars for the South Florida Region.  Without the \u201cdedicated source\u201d we can not even apply for the money.  These matching funds are created by reauthorization of T-21 federal funds which occur only every 6 years.  We must act now or be out of the running for 6 more years.\n \nThe Regional Transportation Authority (RTA) is critical to South Florida.  It enhances our quality of life \u2013it is good for business, it is a great return on dollars invested!  If I can answer any questions or provide more information, please let me know. \n \nSincerely Yours,\n \nAllen C. Harper\n \n \n \n"

        "body": "Cc: MaryLaura.Openshaw@fldoe.org\nsome money while being more effective\n\n\nDear Governor Bush,\n\nThank you for responding so quickly to my expression of concern about our \nbudget.  My wife, who represented the Florida Association of Homes for the \nAging as a lobbyist over the last 20 years, asked \"I wonder if anyone in \nFlorida can write to the Governor like that?\"\n\nHere is a brief statement that develops the idea about how the State can \nsave substantial funds while complying with the class size amendment, and, \nat the same time, increase the likelihood that the additional funds will \nactually produce significant gains in achievement for the children who are \nmost at-risk for failure in school.  I have done this fairly quickly in the \ntime available to me, but could develop it more formally, in consultation \nwith other folks at the center, and in more detail after this week. This \nweek we are coordinating the review of all Reading First applications in \nthe state.\n\nI also want to state at the outset that whether this plan is workable will \ndepend on the legal language of the amendment, which I am not familiar \nwith.  If it allows districts to calculate class size by dividing the \nnumber of students in the district by the number of teachers who actually \nprovide instruction, then it would be feasible.  If the amendment requires \nactual classes in every school at every grade level be of a certain size, \nthen it will be less feasible.\n\nThe core of the idea:\n\nWe should reduce the student:teacher ratio on our schools by increasing the \nnumber of teachers in each school available to provide instruction to \nchildren, not by an across-the-board reduction in the number of children \neach classroom teacher is responsible for.  The extra teachers available \nwithin each district would be assigned to provide timely, intensive \ninterventions to any child who was lagging behind in the development of \ncritical academic skills.  These would not necessarily be \"pull out\" \ninterventions, but could be provided either  in small groups as part of the \nregular block for reading instruction, or in after-school programs. For \nexample, if an elementary school had 4 \"intervention specialists\" on staff, \nthese specialists could work in classrooms during their normally scheduled \n90-120 minute block of reading instruction to provide small group \ninstruction for the most difficult children, while the classroom teacher \nwas working with the students who were closer to grade level.  I would \nsuggest we start with reading: 1) because of your goals in this area; 2) \nbecause this is the area we know the most about in terms of identification \nof students who need the extra instruction; 3) because we know how to \nprovide the more intensive instruction; and, 4) because of the critical \nnature of reading skill for all other academic subjects.  Some schools will \nobviously require more of these \"intervention specialists\" than others, so \nthey should be assigned to schools according to their needs within a \ndistrict.  The student: teacher ratio should thus be calculated at the \ndistrict level rather than the school level to preserve maximum local \nflexibility in implementation.  The most obvious savings from this plan is \nthat it would require no funds to build additional classrooms.\n\n\nInformation and arguments in support of this approach:\n\n1.  Approximately half of Florida's school children are already meeting \nFlorida's high standards for reading achievement by the end of fourth \ngrade, but less than half meet these standards in middle and high \nschool.  It is the students who are not meeting current standards that are \nmost in need of improved instructional conditions in school.  These \nstudents are largely poor and minority children, but substantial numbers \nalso come from middle-class homes in suburban schools.  Every school needs \naccess to \"intervention specialists\", but the need will vary depending on \nthe characteristics of the children served by the school.\n2.  We know from research that the effects of class size reduction vary \nsubstantially from teacher to teacher: the effects depend largely on \nwhether the teacher is able to take advantage of the lower student: teacher \nratio to change the way instruction is delivered in the classroom.  Without \nsubstantial additional training in more effective instruction, as well as \nmore effective ways of organizing the classroom, reducing class size across \nthe board is unlikely to have a substantial effect on reading outcomes for \nour most at-risk children.\n3. We know from research that we can improve reading outcomes for at risk \nchildren if we train and supervise classroom teachers to provide \nevidence-based instruction in reading, but we also know that the \ninstructional needs of children in reading are so enormously varied that a \nsingle classroom teacher cannot meet all their needs (there is not enough \ntime in the day) if her classroom contains more than one or two children \nwith serious needs.\n4.  The most effective way to prevent reading difficulties in young \nchildren, and to remediate them in older children, is to provide small \ngroup instruction for a substantial amount of time by a skilled teacher or \nparaprofessional.  In our own studies, we have shown that it is possible to \nprevent serious reading difficulties in all but about 5% of children if \nthey are given intensive small group interventions during first grade. In \nmany of our schools that have very high poor and minority populations, the \nproportion of children in need of more intensive interventions will likely \nbe as high as 60% of the children.  In order to prevent reading problems in \nthis group of children, my estimate is that they will require 30-45 minutes \na day of small group instruction every day for at least two years during \nthe period from kindergarten to third grade.  Right now, the means to \nprovide this much intensive instruction are quite limited in most of our \nschools.  We are encouraging schools to use their Title 1 money and other \nsources to provide this type of instruction, but the funds are not \navailable in all schools, and they are not sufficient in the neediest schools.\n5. It is also possible to dramatically effect the reading skills of older \npoor readers if they are provided small groups instruction for about 100 \nhours.  There is very good evidence that current approaches to the \nremediation of reading difficulties in older children are ineffective (they \ndo not \"close the gap\") because they are not focused properly or delivered \nwith sufficient intensity.  Children with reading problems are most \nfrequently placed in classrooms with 15-25 other children (even in special \neducation, the teacher is often dealing with groups of 15 children at a \ntime).  By contrast to the ineffectiveness of almost all current public \nschool programs in remediating reading difficulties in older children, our \nresearch shows enormous improvements for most children in late elementary \nand middle schools if they are provided with from 60 to 100 hours \n(depending on where they start) of  skillful instruction  in groups of 3-4 \nchildren.\n6.  This use (provide funds for \"intervention specialists\") would have \nenormous synergies with our current Reading First efforts.  As you know, \nReading First dollars cannot be spent to pay salaries for individuals who \ndirectly teach children, they can only be used for professional \ndevelopment, assessments, and instructional materials.  If we had funds to \npay for more instructional specialists in K-3, we could use Reading First \nmonies to provide training for them.  Reading First money can also be used \nto provide training for special education teachers in grades K-12, and \nthese special education teachers (assuming we could locate sufficient \nnumbers) can be used creatively by schools to provide instruction not only \nfor children formally identified as learning disabled, but also to other \nstudents with similar instructional needs.\n\nHow could such an approach be implemented:\n\n1.  The most important point is that it could not be successfully \nimplemented all at once, at all grade levels.  We would need to work out a \nphase-in plan over the period of time consistent with the class size \namendment, but we could start this fall in all Reading First elementary \nschools, and in a sample of middle and high schools throughout the \nstate.  The really nice thing about this plan is that you could expect to \nsee immediate (after the 100 hours of instruction) improvements in the \nreading skills of any older children participating in this more intensive \ninstruction, and I would predict that substantial numbers of them could be \nmoved from level 1 and 2 performance on the FCAT to level three or \nabove.  This would be particularly true if we were able to focus on \nchildren now reading between the 10th and 30th percentile.\n2.  The Florida Center for Reading Research could identify a limited set (5 \nor 6) of intervention methods and approaches that have at least beginning \nlevels of evidence for effectiveness in preventing and remediating reading \ndifficulties.  I am currently involved with the Haan foundation in \nCalifornia in trying to develop funding for a very large national study of \nintervention methods for older children, and in the process, have held \nmeetings with the major program providers for intervention methods in the \ncountry.  There are at least 6 or so of these program providers (these are \nnot the large publishers you are familiar with) that have the capability to \nprovide training for substantial numbers of teachers in methods that are \nresearch based, and have a proven track record. Again, its important to \nemphasize that the training capability of these folks is not unlimited, so \nwe would need to focus on a relatively small number of schools until we had \ndeveloped a state-based cadre of trainers and supervisors.  The FLARE \ncenter at UCF might also be involved in helping to develop a long-term plan \nfor the ongoing training of \"intervention specialists\" in research based \npreventive and remedial programs.  The coaches we have for Reading First \nschools, could also be a big help in the wise allocation of these new \nintervention resources within schools.\n3.  We at FCRR could also develop an \"implementation manual\" for districts \nthat would provide step by step guidance in how to implement a successful \nprevention or remediation component in their districts. Of course, \ndistricts could \"take it or leave it\", but at least they would have a \nclearly worked out, research-based plan plan to use the new resources \ncoming their way.\n\nAgain, if you think this might be feasible, we could certainly work over \nthe next several weeks to turn it into a formal proposal.  In developing a \nproposal, we would want to coordinate with the folks at DOE (Mary Laura and \nthe folks in special education), other specialists in the state, and \nperhaps consult several of the most effective principals we know.\n\nCheers,\n\nJoe Torgesen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Thank you Joe.

Second, I'd like to\n>briefly share an idea concerning the class size amendment that could\n>save\n>substantial money while increasing the effectiveness of the money that\n>is\n>spent in response to the amendment.\n>\n>First, the Florida Center for Reading Research.  When I discussed the\n>concept of this Center with Mary Laura and Commissioner Horne last\n>spring,\n>they were clear that your vision, and theirs, was for us to become the\n>premier center for reading research (both basic and applied) in the\n>country.  We all agreed that, to do that, we needed a base of permanent,\n>\n>recurring funds with which to hire university faculty in tenure earning\n>lines, and to support an essential core of support staff.  We also\n>agreed\n>that a major mission of the center would be to directly support the\n>acquisition and implementation of a Reading First Grant in\n>Florida.  Although I was clearly one among many in the preparation of\n>this\n>grant, and Mary Laura was instrumental in providing the consistent\n>leadership it took to assemble the grant, my own contributions to both\n>the\n>conceptualization and writing of this grant were substantial.  We have\n>also\n>already hired an excellent staff at FCRR who have been working very hard\n>to\n>develop materials (including a web based data management and reporting\n>system for all our Reading First assessments) and training that will be\n>critical to the success of the project as it unfolds over the next six\n>years.\n>I agreed to assume leadership of the center and try to build it to meet\n>your vision, partly based on the promise of Commissioner Horne that,\n>although they could not provide permanent funding last year, it would be\n>\n>forthcoming this year.  Last year, FSU contributed two faculty lines to\n>us\n>so we could start recruiting faculty for the center, and we have already\n>\n>hired one very good new faculty in psychology, and are interviewing\n>another\n>one this month.  FSU also told me that these lines were loaned\n>\"temporarily\" until our own funding was secured.\n>\n>In the fall of 2002, I gave a recurring budget request for the center to\n>\n>Mary Laura, and she told me she would get it placed in the DOE budget\n>request.  Apparently that request was deleted in the request the DOE\n>sent\n>to your office, or it was deleted during the budget process in your\n>office\n>(I am not really knowledgeable about this process, and have not been\n>able\n>to get precise information).   I wanted to indicate to you directly that\n>\n>this recurring budget is essential if we are to accomplish the mission\n>that\n>you originally established for us.   Any help you can provide us in this\n>\n>process would, of course, be most appreciated.\n>\n>Now, the idea about being more effective while saving money.  If the\n>legislature can construct language that class size is estimated by\n>counting\n>as teachers any personnel that actually teach children regularly, then\n>the\n>money to be spent in compliance with the class size amendment could be\n>used\n>to solve one of the most serious problems we face in leaving no child\n>behind in reading.  At least 50% of our children do not need to be in\n>smaller classes, as they are achieving quite well at present.  However,\n>at\n>least 20-30%  of our students have very little prospect of achieving at\n>grade level by third grade (even with improved, research based classroom\n>\n>instruction) unless they receive more intensive instruction for a\n>substantial period of time during the K-3 years.  The most effective way\n>to\n>reduce the overall class size estimate in the state is to use this money\n>to\n>hire \"intensive intervention\" teachers who can work within regular\n>classroom settings to provide very small group (3-4 students)\n>instruction\n>to the children most at risk for reading failure.  This will not require\n>\n>spending money on new school buildings and classrooms.  We know exactly\n>how\n>to train these \"intensive intervention\" specialists (they can be bright\n>paraprofessionals as well as certified teachers) to be effective with\n>small\n>groups of children in preventing the emergence of reading difficulties,\n>and\n>we know how to set this up in schools (its really the Hartsfield model\n>you\n>know something about already)\n>\n>If you would like me to write a short briefing paper on this concept,\n>documenting both the need for more intensive instruction as a way of\n>preventing reading problems, and the kind of instruction that is\n>required,\n>I would be happy to do so.  We can bring a good share of our children to\n>\n>grade level reading performance by training and supporting our classroom\n>\n>teachers more effectively (as we are trying to do in Reading First), but\n>we\n>will not succeed with another very large group of children if we do not\n>find a way to deliver the immediate intensive interventions that most\n>poor\n>and minority children need to \"catch up\" to their middle class\n>peers.

        "body": "\n\nDear Governor Bush,\n\nPlease excuse the length of this note, but, it is of utmost importance, and I know that you are very concerned and read your mail personally.\n\nI totally understand your concern for the policy of every child should learn how to read and should \"not be left behind.\"  However, in the case of certain children who have Specific Learning Disabilities and those children that are classified as Emotionally Handicapped or Other Health Impaired, retention may not be reasonable for all of them. \n\nThere are many children in second grade already who have been retained once and due to the September 1st birthday; they are currently a few weeks shy of 9 \u00bd years old already.  These children are BIG and retaining them due to a test score is WRONG FOR THEM!  They are doing the best they can and are receiving services as indicated by their IEP's (Individual Educational Plans).  \n\nUnfortunately, many of these children have low IQ's and will never read to the standards they are \"supposed to meet.\"  Thus, if these children cannot perform up to the forthcoming standards, they will be retained twice from K-5.  \n\nThe writing assessment in 4th grade will NOT be in their favor either!  Then you come to 5th grade and they could be retained again.  These children in second and third grade are LARGE!  Some of the fifth graders are ready to shave a moustache and the girls have the bodies of women!\n\nIt is my belief and that of Educators in the Special Education field that dispensations should be made for theses children if they have had retentions. \n\nIn addition, individualized tests should be given to them rather than putting them through the frustration and emotional torture of the FCAT where they just randomly bubble anything because they cannot read or comprehend what is on the paper/test!  \n\nTo an end and to make them productive citizens rather than drop-outs at the age of sixteen (16), these children should be afforded the opportunity to be an APPRENTICE in a field that is of interest to them or guided into a field that their instructors feel would interest them.  In this way, they can at least earn a minimal living. \n\nAs it stands right now, to get into a Vocational High School, students must have an 8th Grade Reading Level which is something that most of them, unfortunately, will never achieve.  The Special Diploma that Florida gives to these students who cannot obtain a Standard Diploma are not even eligible to served in the Armed Forces of the USA and become a Private in the Army! They are INELIGIBLE TO SERVE THEIR COUNTRY!  This is a shame.  So many of these students are handy, crafty and able to fix items that an excellent reader has no idea what to do with the item that is broken.  \n\nThere MUST be ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE for these children.  \nThese children are already receiving daily and small group, as well as one to one (1:1) INTENSIVE REMEDIAL INSTRUCTION. \n\nTHIS NEW BILL IS NOT THE ANSWER FOR THESE STUDENTS! \nPLEASE TRY TO FORMULATE AN ALTERNATIVE PLAN FOR THESE CHILDREN WHO REALLY TRY AND HAVE SO MUCH DIFFICULTY DUE TO THE VARIOUS DISABILITIES THAT THEY HAVE.\n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME,\nDR. SHERI LEVINE\nEXCEPTIONAL EDUCATION SPECIALIST\nTEACHER AND COLLEGE PROFESSOR AT THE GRADUATE  LEVEL\n\n"

The good news is that Maria and her family now have a little ray of sunshine.    Unfortunately, Maria's parents have had to mortgage their home to pay for the attorney, but they did it willingly, knowing that this attorney may be their only chance to\nseek justice in this case.  Originally, I did refer Maria to Legal Aid, but it was a waste of time and energy.\n \nMaria's attorney is now setting up a visitation schedule and has\ntaken over all dealings with DCF.    This alone is a tremendous burden off Maria's shoulders, and we are all grateful for that.\n \nThings look so much better now, and I just wanted to thank you for having your staff check into this situation.  Things aren't always as they appear, and there were some serious problems with this entire case.  There are no guarantees from Maria's attorney, but at least she has a well-qualified attorney representing her.\n \nThanks again--would love to have you come down to Aventura to speak to our Chairman's Roundtable for lunch at Turnberry Isle whenever your schedule would allow.\n \nElaine Adler, President\nAventura Marketing Council\n3575 NE 207 Street, Suite B-16\nAventura, Fl. 33180\n(305)  932-5334\n\n"

        "body": "\n\n\nJeb, - This is kinda long but I think well worth it!\n\n \n\nJust recently I was sitting with my staff in a brainstorming session on ways in which we could fundraise for the school (that\u2019s another conversation).  One of the ideas that came up was a \u201cwalk\u201d.  I was not sure how a \u201cwalk\u201d could help us until the Holy spirit spoke to me and said.  Why not do a Walk for Literacy or a Walk for Reading?  Here are some possibilities:\n\n \n\nWe begin identifying a booklist at every grade level that children could read over the summer.  Each book based on its level would be worth so much pledges (i.e. a Caldecott could be worth $5 pledge, pleasure reading could be worth $2) and the quantity of books read by that student would qualify that student to be placed in a gold, silver or bronze category of reader.\n\n \n\nAt the end of the summer the kids would come to downtown Miami where we would walk to the public library to a wonderful festival of fun where the children would turn in their pledges and would receive the gold, silver or bronze star pen.  All of the pledges and sponsorship money received would be placed in a fund that low performing schools would be eligible to apply for additional assistance and schools could be awarded money for the number of students participating such $ 10,000 first. 5,000 second 2500. third.\n\n \n\nSponsorship for this could come from the publishing companies, book stores etc.  \n\n \n\nOver the summer there would be activities that would involve the community such as: \n\n*\tChildren could participate in read-in at the public libraries, bookstores, community centers and churches   \n\n*\tChildren could participate in buddy/peer reading in the summer programs \n\n*\tHigh School children could read with elementary students, college students could read with high school students in sponsored activities over the summer. \n\n*\tCorporations would assign executives to a child from a low performing school to read with them over the summer their list of books. \n\n \n\n \n\nWhere I think that the greatest benefit for you is that you can make this a part of your reading first initiative!  Mary Laura Oppenshaw can run this right out of her office.  She is a super organizer.  Come and walk with us not only in Miami but around the state in communities everywhere to kick off reading for the new year.  At your leadership conference last year the lady from Texas (can\u2019t remember her name) said that Reading is the new Civil Right!  Let\u2019s walk for that new Civil Right! You, your Brother, your Mother.  Two generations of believers in Literacy.  This effort alone could boost reading scores for next year.  I also have a format that would work to ensure that students understand what they have read. \n\n \n\nI am so excited!!  I will end here because I know that pretty soon you will be scrolling down on the screen.  Let me know what you think.\n\n \n\nP.S.  I am so glad that you will be spending more time here in Miami, We\u2019ve missed you \u2013 \u201cI\u201d have missed you. \u2013 Trina \n\n \n\n \n\n"

(Kavika & Kulani Nihipali) These are my great-grandchildren, a 3 yr. old male, and 2 yr.old female, that have been in the DCF system now for a little over a year, with an ongoing custody battle by their Dad in Hawaii. From the information I have, it seems that a hearing was held here within the last few days, and it was determined that these 2 little ones should be returned to their Dad in Hawaii. Jeb, this is a huge mis-carriage of justice that needs to be stopped!!!  The Dad has already FAILED 2 drug tests - why in the name of heaven would anyone even consider giving him custody of these 2 minor children??  Their Mom (my granddaughter) is a drug addict as well as the Dad, and she is exactly where she belongs - just been sentenced to 3 yrs. in prison here in Florida. She lost her \"parental rights\" several months ago, so she is no problem, as far as the custody battle goes. \n \nThese children have been in the home of my daughter, Dena Macomber (this is the one that works at Lee CO. Sheriff's Dept.), for well over a year, in a \"foster home\" situation, and there is a very nice, upstanding couple that have passed all the requirements set out by DCF to adopt these two little ones, and to think that these little ones will be denied a nice stable home and family, is just absolutely unthinkable. If there is any way possible for your new director of DCF to take a look at this case, and hopefully stop the transfer of the children to a very undesireable home life, all of the family here will be eternally grateful.\n \nThanking you in advance for anything you can do, \n \nSincerely, Carol Glancy \n \nPS. I did hear back from Brian, and even though the news was NOT good on our part, I do sincerely thank you for your help.\n\n"

One being that the man doesn't even have gainful employment. When the children were in Hawaii, they were on the Welfare System. Also, these babies don't even know who this guy is. They were brought to the states in Feb. 2000, at that time the little boy was just 16 mos. old, the little girl was 6 mos. old. They are now established in the home that I told you about, and call the people \"Mommy & Daddy\". The biggest issue that I left out by mistake is the fact that he introduced my granddaughter (his step-child) to drugs at the early age of 11 yrs. of age!!  He had her smoking \"pot\", and then when she was about 12, he took her to the home of a friend of his and she was given cocaine. Now, this child at the age of 14, is so addicted to cocaine, that she has prostituted herself ( along with her sorry Mom) to obtain money to support her habit. This kid has been in the DCF system also since Aug. 2000, and has a record as a runaway, 2 counts of auto theft, money theft (over $2,000.00), and just recently, within the past couple weeks was arrested for possession of drugs at school. Now, would that be the kind of future we want for these two innocent babies?? I think not!!!\n \nThanks again, Carol\n"

Bush deserves credit for putting money behind his\nreading push. \n\nA bright spot shines in Gov. Jeb Bush's austere budget package: Mr. Bush\nwants to spend even more money to help Florida's children become successful\nreaders. \n\nHis decision to stay focused on reading for a second year shows leadership\nand tenacity. Improving reading scores in Florida's schools surely is no\nsnap. More than half the state's students perform below their grade level on\nthe state reading test. \n\nMr. Bush proposes spending $30 million in state money next year on Just\nRead, Florida! -- a $19 million increase that would be money well spent. The\nreading initiative is a multipronged approach to have all Florida students\nreading by the end of third grade and to help every student become a\nsuccessful, independent reader. \n\nThe governor proposes concrete help for students who still struggle with\nreading in higher grades. His proposal would put more trained reading\nteachers into middle schools, where they are desperately needed. \n\nGiving Floridians a one-month sales-tax break when they buy books, as Mr.\nBush also proposes, is largely a symbolic gesture meant to encourage\nreading. Symbols are key to any campaign, though, and no campaign is more\nimportant to Florida's future than one focused on reading. This state has no\nhope of improving its quality of life if it ignores this cornerstone of\nlearning. ADVERTISEMENTS \n\n\nProblems with this email?

Don Young has done(see below), White House\nintervention with Hastert, Young and Pombo is necessary or the progress we\nare making in the Senate could be wiped out in the House.  If there is any\nway you can get the right call made from the White House, it would likely\nmake the difference between winning or losing this issue.\n\nCharles\n\n****************\n\n\n\n\nI just learned from House Interior Approps staff that Pombo (Chairman,\nResources) and Don Young (Chairman, Transportation and Infrastructure) sent\na letter to Speaker Hastert asking him to prevent the 8.5 SMA from being\nincluded in the Conference report.  Thus, a victory in the Senate on 6D in\nthe Omnibus Appropriations bill could still be thwarted in Conference, even\nthough we have the support of Chairman Bill Young and the other\nAppropriators.\n\nHouse approps staff is convinced that unless calls from the WH and Gov. Bush\nare made to Hastert, Don Young, and Pombo, the language won't survive\nconference.  I'm told that the Governor is already engaged, but we need to\nmake sure that the WH is as well.  \n\nI suggest making calls to Anne Klee at Interior and Jim Connaughton at CEQ\nand ask them to encourage Secretary Norton and Andy Card to weigh in with\nHastert, Young and Pombo.  I'm told that calls will need to be made from the\nhighest levels of the WH to turn those Members around --  staff to staff\ncalls won't cut it.  Let's also encourage Shaw, Goss, Voinovich and other\nR's to weigh in.\n\nHouse and Senate staff expect to start conferencing the appropriations bill\nthis weekend and to have it wrapped up by Feb, 7th, so that is our drop-dead\ndate for getting the opposition to relent. \n\nSean McMahon\nNational Audubon Society\n1150 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.\nSuite 600\nWashington, DC  20036-4104\nphone) 202-861-2242\nfax) 202-861-4290\nsmcmahon@audubon.org\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nmail2web - Check your email from the web at\nhttp://mail2web.com/ .\n\n\n"

        "subject": "DiMare purchases Fresh America",
        "body": "\nFresh America now in the hands of DiMare \n\nBy Ryan Kane\n\nOnly two months have passed since Fresh America Corp. confirmed its decision to go private \u2013 a move that the company believed at the time, would be the first crucial step in its efforts to dig itself out of a few years of accumulating debt. Yet, the situation took a surprise turn this week, as the Arlington, Texas produce firm revealed it has just been sold.\n\nThe buyer, DiMare Fresh Inc. of Homestead, FL, did not reveal a purchase price for its acquisition of Fresh America, but in a press release, said the deal became final on Jan. 22. According to Paul J. DiMare, president of DiMare Homestead Inc., DiMare Fresh was just recently formed to provide \u201ca vertically integrated tomato company with a national presence.\u201d\n\nMr. DiMare noted the acquisition of Fresh America as an essential part of DiMare Fresh\u2019s goal of growing the business on a national scale. \u201cThis new concept will position DiMare as one of the leading national produce companies that can service the needs of anyone who uses produce,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Fresh America, the sale became the company\u2019s last resort when faced with the fact that it would be unable to continue due to a breakdown in its discussions with lenders. \u201cWe were unable to obtain financing, and that basically led to the sale,\u201d said Fresh America Chief Financial Officer Cheryl Taylor. \u201cThe people behind our existing lender backed away and we had talks with a new lender, but those talks broke down.\u201d\n\nTaylor told RBCS that discussions with DiMare began roughly two weeks ago, but that Fresh America had been looking to sell the business prior to that.\n\nIn November of 2002, Fresh America announced that it had gone private by filing a \u201cForm 15\u201d with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Plummeting share prices had resulted in the company\u2019s delisting from Nasdaq in 2001, however, Fresh America said its November filing for removal of its stocks on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board was a conscious decision.\n\nShortly after the filing, Fresh America CEO Mark Prowell told RBCS that becoming a private company eliminated a number of accounting costs, attorney costs and other professional fees. \u201cWe have cut several hundred thousand dollars from our annual expenses,\u201d he had said.\n\nLeading up to the Nasdaq delisting, Fresh America had been hit with consistent losses and accumulating debt due to a number of financial set backs over the past few years. From its failed merger with Houston-based FreshPoint Inc., to its closing of several foodservice locations, to the costly shut down of Sam Perricone Citrus, Los Angeles, CA, Fresh America continued to struggle.\n\nHowever, with the move to go private and Taylor\u2019s then confirmation of a notable amount of debt reduction under Fresh America\u2019s senior credit facility, Taylor and Prowell agreed the firm had made some headway. Though, on the morning of Jan. 23, Taylor\u2019s tone had changed.\n\n\u201cThe company has been in serious financial trouble for some time, and it is very much in the hole,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWhat\u2019s important now is that the sale to DiMare will be the best opportunity for Fresh America to maximize distribution to creditors.\u201d\n\nRBCS has confirmed that DiMare Fresh purchased equipment, inventories and boxes from Fresh America, and that at least a portion of the facilities involved were leased by Fresh America. RBCS has also been told that DiMare assumed no liabilities in the deal.\n\n\u201cThe attorneys are working right now to determine what is owed to creditors, including amounts due to PACA Trust creditors,\u201d said Taylor.\n\nTaylor declined to comment on estimated amounts due to creditors, though RBCS has discovered that at least four separate law firms are in the process of gathering groups of Trust creditors and that discussions were progressing as of Jan. 23.\n\nAs for the fates of Fresh America\u2019s employees, especially the executive level management, Taylor noted that the \u201ccore group\u201d would stay on with DiMare Fresh. According to the DiMare news release, efforts will be made to build DiMare Fresh with a \u201cdedicated employee base\u201d from Fresh America.\n\n\n\n"

Florida continues to be the nation's stand out in terms of job growth, with a growing job market that created nearly 62,000 more jobs in December 2002 compared to a year ago. This marks the sixth consecutive month of positive over-the-year job growth in Florida.\n  \nAmong the nation's ten most populous states, only Florida and California recorded positive job growth from November 2001 to November 2002 (the latest comparable month available), with Florida leading in both job growth rate and the number of jobs created.\n \nFlorida's preliminary unemployment rate for December of 5.3% is virtually unchanged from the revised November rate of 5.2% and 0.7% below the rate of December 2001. This is the third consecutive month where our rate is below the year-ago rate.  The U.S. unemployment rate for December is 6.0%.\n \nFlorida showed a slight increase in the number of initial claims for unemployment compensation in December, with claims increasing by 2.3% over-the-year. \nOur economists indicate that the factors behind that increase are largely seasonal with a portion of it attributed to manufacturing.\n   \nIn December 2002, 11 of Florida's 16 published metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) reported higher nonagricultural employment than a year ago. Miami continued to create the most new jobs over the year (+18,500 jobs, +1.8 percent), followed by West Palm Beach-Boca Raton (+6,600 jobs, +1.3 percent) and Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater (+5,700 jobs, +0.5 percent). \n \nThe Orlando MSA continues its rebound with two consecutive months of over-the-year job gains. (+4,500 jobs, +0.5 percent).  The fastest rate of growth over-the-year was in the Tallahassee MSA at 1.9%\n \nThe county with the lowest unemployment rate is Alachua County at 2.2% followed closely by Monroe County at 2.3%. Hendry County continued to have the state's highest unemployment rate (8.2 %), followed by Taylor County at 8.0%.\n\nWarren May \nCommunications Director \nAgency for Workforce Innovation \nWarren.May@awi.state.fl.us \n(850) 245-7130 \n\n \n"

Anything short of this, may bring into question the validity and reliability of the results. \n\t\n\tAs an example, when I attended FSU, a junior English exam was administered in four different parts, composition, spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure.  If a student flunked any part of the exam, they had to take a noncredit course until a satisfactory score was achieved.  In addition, a further measure of compliance was put in place which upon graduation, the student could not receive a diploma until that exam was taken and passed. In my opinion, a student will be motivated to do his very best on any exam given if there are consequences to deal with in case of failure to demonstrate minimum standards of performance.\n\t\n\tComparing this to a manufacturing process, this would be the quality control point of the education industry.

But this time, it isn't for our organization, to save  two giant oak trees in Panacea that DOT is intent on cutting down.  Because they frame the town with their massive trunks covered with resurrection ferns, and add character to the highway, seventeen years ago the citizens agreed to pay extra to have the water and sewer lines routed around them.  While the Wakulla County Commission was willing to listen and consider the aesthetic value of the  trees, DOT is not.   Big red \"x\"s have been painted on their massive trunks; bulldozers are perched to go, and unless you intervene the trees will be gone in the next day or so. I contacted Steven Monock of the Chipley office, but he insists they are in the way and must go.  If they do, Panacea will be a poorer and shabbier town for it, and most of the citizens I've spoken to don't feel it's necessary.  We regret that we've never given an opportunity to comment on what's happening to our town or involved in the planning process. Citizens called a meeting with their contractor, and express their concern at a Waterfronts Florida meeting in Panacea  several months ago, after  DOT destroyed dozens of virgin slash pines to create giant ditches to improve storm water runoff.  While they may have solved one potential problem, they created another: the ditches are now filled with stagnant water. There are no plans to revegetate them with wetland vegetation where mosquito fish can live, and come summer they will breed mosquitoes and increase our  risk of West Nile Virus. We appreciate the fact that DOT is  widening the road and making it safer for us to drive, but surely there has to be exceptions to their engineer's plans that call for the removal of giant oaks.  Please Jeb,  intervene with DOT and ask them to save the hundred year old trees that give our town character and set it apart from the endless carscapes of the world.  \n \n    Best wishes, good luck in your second term, and thanks for your help in the past.  I know a couple of trees is a small matter in the scheme of things, but it's the small matters that count. Best,   Jack Rudloe  \n      \n\n"

        "body": "\n\nDear Governor Bush,\n     I am at the end of my road with my problems concerning employment, and I am questioning my own integrity although I worked a stringent 12-step program since my last conviction/crimes of 1988. I always turn directly to you when the road ends, as you are the only human with the power to overturn any State Government Agency decisions. Being a Christian woman with high moral and ethical values, I never, before our Lord God, could ask you to intervene in anything unless a wrong had occurred. With no gainful job since August 2002, I had no money to hire an attorney to pursue my case, which is so complicated and opens so many cans of worms down to the point that my losing and leaving the nursing home job was not just a cut and dry case of a person resigning. No one, in today's tight job market, would up and quit a job, lose their health benefits with a husband dying of diabetic-related problems and end-stage liver cirrhosis (although clean and sober), myself having clear medical cause that was interfering with my life and job, unless they believed they would received benefits while seeking work elsewhere. My plan was to obtain a counseling job to help persons seeking recovery from addictions, bow out gracefully from the nursing home business. I had so many reasons to leave that job, but I was devoted to my patients, as I was an advocate for them, and I knew that the administration wanted me out of there for fear of me exposing practices that could close them down. I could not continue working and turn my head to unbelievable things, but I have no concrete proof for many of the issues and they knew it. I never wanted to tell you this, but my own family had filed a wrongful death lawsuit in 1999 after my Father, having no legs, fell head first onto a concrete floor in a nursing home, and subsequently died of subdural hematomas, and for which the facility refused to send him out to the hospital for 10 days, even as a begged them daily, and at the facility where I lost my first therapy job, purportedly behind the criminal background check law effective 10/98. I never divulged this as the real reason I lost my job out of fear you would judge my character negatively as I pursued getting my rights restored.  This brings to light the truth as to why I am blackballed from the nursing home business-my Father died as a result of a neglilence, my Family has suffered unnameable pain and suffering, my Mother died as an indirect result of watching my Father in a coma.  My Father was a WWII veteran, awarded Purple Heart, went to work at the Norfolk Naval Air Station as an aircraft mechanic, retired GS-13 1977, assisted in design and upkeep of the F14 Tomcat, was a Mason, Shriner, Mooser, golfer, but most of all, a man of God, who lived to help others and work for his church for free, very humble man, never asking to be paid for his services.  They retired here to Ocala in 1977, had a wonderful life, until my Mother became wheelchair bound.  But I was here since release in 1992 from prison, clean and sober, to take care of all their needs, as he lost his health helping my Mother.  I never got a tax break, but did all I possibly could as they stood behind me, believed in me as a child of God, even when I was doing things against the law to get drugs for a few months out of my life, which lead to going to prison (back in VA).  Never in a million years could I have dreamed I would suffer like I am right now.  I have severe fibroymyalgia and several herniated discs in my back, mostly from work since all the staffing cuts of 1999, having to lift heavy patients without help, else lose my job.  This one boss that was hired a year after me began harassing me in 2000. It is a very detailed story, and I have no proof. However, he wrote me up with issues that were twisted, for he is a master of deception.  The bottom line is they wanted me out of there for I knew too much of what goes on behind the scenes.  I called the AWI to ascertain if I could receive benefits if fired, and was told no. So I resigned my job, for medical reasons, as I had repetitive motion syndrome in my spine which was inoperable.  The boss told me I was on a 30 probation period and if any disagreenent or anything happened, I would be fired.  He had a way of getting patients to say things about me, such as leaving them unattended.  I had to work every Sunday without help, and of course patients had to sit and wait their turn to be wheeled back to their room, one by one. It was a set-up Governor, to ultimately run me out of there.  The good news is that I had been going to school as I told you about before, and got a MA in Counseling.  To change jobs would mean making only half the salary in the beginning of what I made as a PT assistant.  But I had to do it to save my life, which brings me back to the original problem.  It appears the Agency will not allow me to fully present my case because I did not do so prior to the phone hearing back in Oct.  They expected me to have witnesses at my home, which was impossible to ask patients to come here to speak up for me.  I provided the Agency with names and numbers, but they said they don't investigate in that manner.  How was I to present my side if not allowed to come in person and confront my employer with his allegations?  I trusted the system, that since I quit the job for good medical cause and was seeking work in another area, that I would be able to collect benefits while doing so.  Governor, without the back pay for weeks claimed awarded, I will, in just a few more weeks, become among Florida's homeless community.  I understand the Agency saying I could not add evidence to my case, but the Agency lead me with a line of questioning during the first interview that made me believe if I said anything to do with medical problems, I would have to file a workers compensation claim.  That is the last thing I wanted to do.  So I am asking you to override their decision, based on the good medical cause for leaving my job, and if you need to, you can contact my physician, Dr. Stephen Bookbinder  352-3-237-7171, and he has permission to state to your office that he told me to get out of the nursing home business before I end up hurt so bad I become totally disabled.\n                                  Truthfully and in dire need, \n                           Winifred Buman McDavid   ssn  [REDACTED] \n\n"

I enjoyed the inauguration and wish you great success in the next four years. Thank you for mentioning the environment in your inaugural address and for your commitment to conservation since becoming Governor. \n\nAs you may know, I have assumed the position of Southeast Division Director of The Nature Conservancy on a full time basis, and we have hired Vicki Tschinkel to be Florida Chapter Director. Vicki, I, and Roy Rogers (the Florida Chapter Board Chair) are requesting the opportunity to meet with you for 30 minutes to discuss the future of Florida Forever and related conservation funding.\n\nWe understand the budget challenges the state is facing and the ambitious priorities you have set for your next four years. We believe the conservation of land and water reinforce your goals of supporting Florida\u2019s economy and its families. As you know, Florida\u2019s natural character is the cornerstone of its attractiveness to tourists and to new full-time and season residents. Conserved watersheds and aquifer recharge areas supply the clean water needed to support growth. Buffering military bases from encroachment has become essential to maintaining a large military presence in Florida. Parks and outdoor spaces are a refuge for families from the difficulties of everyday life. With low interest rates and critical conservation land for sale, we would like to discuss how Florida Forever, Everglades funding and working with the military on base encroachment can continue to create a legacy of parks and clean water for Florida\u2019s future.\n\nWe greatly appreciate our similar talks on these issues in the past and your historic support for conservation during your first term. We hope a another such meeting can help establish the foundation for completing a conservation legacy for which Floridians will be grateful in all the years to come. Thank you again for all that you have done.  Bob\n\n"

As we reported in last\nweek's update, at least the President stepped in and put the kibosh on that\nlast one.\n\nBut all these claims that the country can't afford the cost of fair and\nreasonable manpower and compensation programs led us to check a few\nstatistics. And the data show that those claims are unadulterated hogwash.\n\nIn FY2002, personnel costs made up 25% of the DoD budget. The only time that\nnumber has been lower in the last 25 years was the \"hollow force/erosion of\nbenefits\" era of 1979-81 (21-23%). But that doesn't tell the real story\neither. There are more things than personnel costs that affect that\nstatistic...such as how much is spent on procurement. What happens when\nDefense takes a \"procurement holiday\" as has happened over the last decade?\nThe personnel share of the budget goes up, that's what. If procurement had\ncontinued at the pace that virtually everyone in government now recognizes\nwas actually needed, the personnel share of the defense budget would have\nbeen much lower.\n\nPersonnel costs comprised 30.8% of the Defense-minus-procurement budget in\nFY2002 - vs. 37% in 1991, 47.6% in 1986, and 34% in 1976. Today's figure, by\nthat measure, isn't far from 1981's 28.6% low.\n\nRather than bemoaning the current figures, Defense budget hawks should\nconsider that personnel accounts would have to be raised another $6 billion\nto restore the 1990's ratios. And that's before you even consider the size\nof the Defense budget itself, which has plummeted as a percentage of the\nGross National Product - the best measure of the nation's economic\ncapability.\n\nIn 1976, the Defense Budget stood at 5.4 percent of the GNP. That figure\nrose in the 1980's, but began to decline towards the end of the Cold War.\nThe Defense budget now stands at 3.2 percent of the GNP -- barely half the\n1986 figure, and still far below the 5% of 1979's military doldrums. See\nmore data at www.moaa.org/Legislative/BudgetRatios.asp .  We say again: with\na force that's 30% smaller than it was 15 years ago, it's not personnel\ncosts that are the problem.\n\nIt's the failure to recognize that the cost of needed people program\nupgrades, long-delayed modernization, and ever-increasing operations with a\nmuch-reduced force can't be balanced on the backs of active, Guard, Reserve,\nand retired members and their families and survivors without long-term\nretention and readiness consequences.\n\nIssue 2: Help MOAA Get a Handle on TRICARE Access Problems\n\nMost legislative update subscribers know that a top MOAA goal is to attract\nmore providers to participate in TRICARE. We're talking to legislators and\nDefense officials about legislative and policy options to accomplish that\ngoal.\n\nBut the discussions always start with, \"We need your help in identifying the\nspecific areas of the country with the most significant access problems and\ngathering data about the extent of those problems.\"\n\nIf we're going to help get the problem solved, we need your help in getting\nour arms around it in a very specific way.\n\nTo that end, we've set up a simple survey form on MOAA's Web site\n(www.moaa.org/Legislative/TRICARESurvey2003/) to let MOAA members and others\nprovide information on problems you have experienced in finding doctors who\nwill accept new TRICARE Standard patients.\n\nThe response options are limited so we can consolidate answers in a database\nformat, but we've also provided a space to describe the problems in your\narea in your own words.\n\nThe more input that we get from you, the easier it is to say what those\nareas are, and the more ammunition we have to fight for your benefits.\n\nPlease remember that the focus of the survey is on how hard it is to find a\nTRICARE provider in your area, not on problems with specific providers or\nclaims issues. And it's important to address only recent conditions\n(experiences occurring within the last 12 months). We can't base current\ninitiatives on data from several years ago.\n\nIssue 3: Also, Tell Your Legislators About TRICARE Problems\n\nThe February issue of MOAA's Military Officer magazine will hit the street\nnext week, and has a centerfold with three tear-out letters for members to\nsend to the Secretary of Defense and the Chairmen of the House and Senate\nArmed Services Committees.\n\nThe letters urge actions that will make TRICARE more attractive to providers\nand require DoD's health care contractors to help TRICARE Standard\nbeneficiaries find participating providers.\n\nWe hope you're willing to foot the cost of three stamps to get this message\nto senior officials in positions to help address these important problems.\n\nSubscription Information\n\nTo subscribe/unsubscribe or change your email address for the legislative\nupdate, please go to http://www.moaa.org/email.

Bush:\n\n \n\nKeeping in tune with increasing public service efficiencies while reducing government growth and spending, I wanted to introduce/note or recommend an efficiency that I believe directly compliments your three (3) priorities of reading/literacy, diversifying the economy and strengthening families.  In-light of the impending challenges of the upcoming budget year of 03-04, I believe that further cost saving may be realized through consolidation of prevention service dollars across various state agencies.  According to OPPAGA\u2019s November 2002 Juvenile Justice Prevention review report which cited 1.2 billion dollars of uncoordinated prevention service funding spread across various state agencies.  These prevention dollars if consolidated and effectively coordinated would address the aforementioned priorities listed above. In the event that a faith base office is created, the 1.2 billion dollars of existing administrative personnel, office space, expense and service dollars if consolidated into the faith base office or department of state/community partnerships would be of tremendous savings; not to mention the increased coordination of services with uniformed measurable outcomes attached to each service.  I wanted to try to keep this short while providing as much information to delivery an impact; unfortunately it went a little long.  I have much more detailed information if this is of interest and would be honored and interested to participate or facilitate if this becomes of any serious consideration.           \n\n \n\nRespectfully,\n\n \n\nRod Love\n\n\n\t\t\t\n____________________________________________________\n <http://www.incredimail.com/redir.asp?ad_id=309&lang=9>    IncrediMail - Email has finally evolved -  <http://www.incredimail.com/redir.asp?ad_id=309&lang=9> Click Here\n"

        "body": "\n\n\nMr. Bush,\n\nI am a VERY concerned parent of a 3rd grade ESE student and how she is being \naffected by the new law \"No child left behind\".  I don't know if the people \nwho made this new law ever took into consideration the affect it would have \non ESE students and their self-esteem.  I can't believe any of you have.  Do \nyou have  any idea how a student with a learning disability struggles on a \nday to day basis.  My daughter is a child that gives 110% effort to her \nclass work and homework and she even makes \"B\" honor roll since 2nd grade \nand is still making \"B\" honor roll today, but if she doesn't pass the FCAT \nest with a 2.0 she will be retained.  Do you know what that will do to her \nself-esteem?  I do!!!!  It will beat it down,we will lose all the ground we \nhave made.  All we have ever told her is to give it your all at school do \nyour best and she has, but now that is not enough.  How can that be?  If you \nhave a child who already has a couple of cards stacked against them , not \nyou are throwing the entire deck on her.  I know that you formed a Blue \nRibbon Task Force to look at this issue, but I understand it hasn't really \nhelped, ESE students. ESE students have accommodations written into their \nIEP to make sure that they are meeting their goals also set up in their IEP, \nbut during the FCAT test not all of the accommodations will be aloud.  For \ninstance my daughter is to have ALL her work read to her because she has a \nvery big struggle with reading because she is Dyslexic and SLD. She meets \nher goals every year that are in her IEP, so how can one test make or break \nher?  Does that seems fair to you?  The other part of this is that an ESE \nstudent  that has an IEP is covered under the federal law, IDEA, now state \nlaw wants to supercede that. I am not a lawyer but I don't think that is how \nit works.  I have filed a formal complaint against the State of Florida with \nthe Office of Civil Right for discrimination against ESE students.  I have \nformed a parent organization to fight for all the right of ESE in my area of \nSt.Lucie county, our name is P.O.S.S.E., which stand for Parents of Students \nin Special Education and we plan on fighting this FCAT issue completely.  We \nattend a meeting on the 21st of this month in West Palm Beach and from that \nmeeting we are gathering to file a class action suit against Florida and \nalso parents were encouraged to file a complaint with the Office of Civil \nRights and I believe many of them did.  As parents if we don't stand up and \nfight for our children's right then who will.  Our thought is that during \nthe last election (when you were re-elected) there was an amendment to make \nsure that pigs are treated kindly, I would think that we can pass a law on \nhow ESE students deserve to be treated, and how to they should be helped to \nsucceed in life.  Please take a serious look at this.  I know that all of \nthe parents I have been talking to would love to have some further \naccommodations made for ESE students for the FCAT or even a way of an \nalternative assessment.\n\nThank you for your time from a very concerned parent,\n\n\nBarbara Ball\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nThe new MSN 8: smart spam protection and 2 months FREE*  \nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\n\n"

        "body": "\nI would like to nominate Governor Jeb Bush of the state of Florida for the ANCOR award to be presented by the National Governors Association Conference.\n\nGovernor Bush has just been overwhelmingly reelected to his second 4-year term as Governor of Florida.One of the reasons for his overwhelming reelection is his commitment to the disabled citizens of Florida.  During his first term, the Governor inherited a Developmental Disability Program that had been inadequately funded for the past 8+ years.  He was facing numerous lawsuits that were filed to address the long waiting lists, some of the people on these lists had been waiting 10+ years for services.  To say that Governor Bush faced a crisis would be an understatement.  Much to the Governor's credit, he faced the crisis head on and began the arduous task of getting much needed funding out of the Florida legislature to address some of these inequities.  In 1998, when the Governor took office, the total budget for Developmental Disabilities was $502 million, for Fiscal year 2003/2004, his proposed budget is 1.096 billion, this is an increase of 118%.  His commitment to the Developmentally Disabled has never wavered.  Every major state of the state speech he has discussed his commitment.  He has also been instrumental in developing what he called \"Family Care Councils\".  These councils were designed as a conduit of information between he state government and the families of Florida's disabled citizens. These councils also had a direct link on the states web page as a form of information sharing for all concerned parties.  He has also instituted a \"System Re-design\", which included such unique programs as \"Consumer Directed Care\" and \"Flexible Services Menus\", both concepts are new to Florida's disabled citizens.\n\nTo commend Governor Bush for his commitment to the Developmentally Disabled seems so inadequate, we should all speak of his accomplishments and encourage him to continue to show this level of leadership to his fellow Governor's, much as he did on a state level.  His Leadership on disability issues, and his commitment to the disabled citizens of Florida has never wavered, and for that we are certainly grateful to have such a committed leader in the state of Florida.\n\nIf you would like additional information on Governor Bush, please do not hesitate to contact me either via email or at 305-325-0112.\n\nClint Bower \nCoordinator of Government Affairs and Special Projects \n\n"

The \ndecision of the Georgia Court of Appeals dated 7/10/01 \nappears as Appendix B. The Decision of the Superior Court \nof DeKalb County, Georgia in Civil Action No. 98-12744-9 \ndated 5/14/01 appears as Appendix C.\n\nJURISDICTION\n\nThe judgment of the Georgia Supreme Court was \nentered on January 9, 2002. This petition for certiorari is \nbeing filed within 90 days of that date. Jurisdiction is \ninvoked under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71254(1).\n\nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED\n\nNone specifically invoked.\n\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nA large, well defined, class of civil cases exists \nacross the United States in which some Courts routinely \npersist in failing their fundamental duty to do justice. In \nthese cases, the court rules that a status of paternity exists, \nand when later confronted with credible, conclusive \nscientific evidence of non-paternity, by way of the relatively \nnew, reliable \"DNA Test\", refuses by artifice and avoidance, \nto reopen the matter, release the erroneously implicated \n\"non-father\" from financial liability, and further refuses to \nreimburse the \"non-father\" for sometimes huge past child \nsupport assessments having no lawful basis.\n\nA civil state court acquires subject matter jurisdiction \nover the financial duties of a \"putative father\" only if that \nman is in fact the biological or adoptive father of the subject \nchild. Releasing such a man from the financial duties of \nfatherhood is not discretionary, when, not being an adoptive \nparent, that man is demonstrated by the clear result of DNA \ntesting not to be the biological father. Such demonstration \nfinally and without recourse constitutes ab initio lack of the \ncourt's subject matter jurisdiction over the subject of the \ndemonstrated non-father's duty of financial support.\n\nLack of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at \nany time, for it goes to the most crucial connection by which \na court acquires the right and obligation to exert that court's \npower over the affected non-father. The subterfuge of \nrefusing to deal with wrongful paternity adjudications by \nclaiming \"laches\", or excessive passage of time, cannot \nlawfully be applied to matters later shown to lack ab initio \nsubject matter jurisdiction. \n\nNor may the fiction of paternity be maintained in \nlight of wrongful conduct by any party, for subject matter \njurisdiction is a fundamental litigative necessity which is \nneither created nor destroyed by litigative action; rather, it \neither exists as a factual basis, or it does not. \nA court, upon finding that it lacks ab initio subject \nmatter jurisdiction, has a very high duty to expeditiously \ndeclare its lack of such jurisdiction, and to restore the status \nquo ante, that is, to declare that the erroneously declared \nfather is not, and never was, the actual father, and further, \nthat any child support paid by him under the false impression \nof his paternity, or by court order, be wholly refunded to \nhim.\n\nPetitioner Carnell A. Smith, representing himself, \nhereby petitions that a Writ of Certiorari issue to the Georgia \nSupreme Court regarding the denial by that Court on January \n9, 2002 of leave to appeal from the Order of the Honorable \nEdward A. Wheeler, Senior Judge, Stone Mountain Judicial \nCircuit , Superior Court, DeKalb County, dated May 14, 2001.\n\nPetitioner respectfully submits that the Superior \nCourt of DeKalb County committed fundamental error at \nlaw, in denying to Petitioner a new trial, sought on August \n28, 2000 (less than three years from entry of the Superior \nCourt's Consent Legitimation Order dated July 28, 1999, and \nits March 2, 2000 Visitation and Child Support Order) based \nupon newly discovered DNA evidence of non-paternity. \n\nFurther, that each of the involved Georgia Appellate Courts \nfailed to abide by their respective mandatory duty to examine \na claimed lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction, by refusing to \ngrant Petitioner's Applications for Discretionary review.\nPetitioner further submits that the Superior Court of \nDeKalb County committed fundamental error at law, in \ndenying retrial of an order of legitimization originally based \nupon application and consent of the de-facto non-father \nbefore he suspected Plaintiff/Respondent's fraudulent \nconcealment.\n\nThe Application to the Court of Appeals urged, and \nthe subsequent State Supreme Court Petition for Certiorari, \nor alternatively, Application for Discretionary Appeal \nnecessarily re-urged, that lack of de-facto biological \npaternity deprives the Superior Court ab initio of subject \nmatter jurisdiction to assess statutory child support from the \nnon-father, or to enter or perpetuate an order of \nlegitimization as to the non-father.\n\nSince lack of subject matter jurisdiction may be \nraised at any time, it would, if recognized herein, establish \nprecedent broadly applicable in every State, to all defrauded \nbiological non-fathers who are wrongfully refused cessation \nof child support orders and reimbursement for formal or \ninformal past payments of child support arising from a \nmistaken belief in their paternity status. \n\nWrongful perpetuation of Georgia Court Orders \nassessing child support when the parties and the courts \nbecome aware that Jurisdiction for such orders is lacking \n(because the man so ordered is not the biological father \nintended by the legislature) rises to constitutional \ndimensions, and is a crucial matter of nationwide \nimportance, justifying this court's resolution by \nestablishment of a nationwide precedent. No United States \nSupreme Court precedent specifically prohibits such a \nmiscarriage of justice. \n\nThis Application is the ideal vehicle for reaching a \nprecedent upon which all paternity litigants may rely, and is \ntherefore a matter of national public interest. Public trust and \nconfidence in our court system is shaken so long as the \nfiction which perpetuates the child support order below, is, \nalong with similar cases, the continuing subject of public \noutrage and media attention.\nPetitioner was led to believe, during pregnancy of his \nformer intimate, Respondent Toni W. Odum, that the child \nshe carried was his. She concealed from him for about a \ndecade, the possibility that he was not the father. Relying \nthereon, Petitioner paid voluntary child support, and later, in \nthe caption-referenced Paternity matter, paid court ordered \nsupport. By counterclaim, Petitioner in good faith secured \nthe child's legitimization and court-ordered custodial and \nvisitation rights. \n\nOnly thereafter did Petitioner first become aware of \nthe possibility of his non-paternity. Two DNA tests have \neach conclusively excluded him as father. The Superior \nCourt on May 14, 2001, denied Petitioner's motion for new \ntrial, based upon his not having earlier availed himself of \nDNA testing before he had reason to suspect he might not be \nthe father.\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nThe question of subject matter jurisdiction is not \ndiscretionary, but is rather a matter of law which may be \nraised at any time.\n\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\n\nThe parties resided together and had a sexual \nrelationship, which ended when they separated. Shortly after \nsuch separation, Respondent/mother informed Petitioner of \nher pregnancy, and claimed that he was the father. She \ndeliberately concealed the fact that she contemporaneously \nhad had sexual relations with another man. Thus deceived, \nPetitioner acted as father by developing a relationship with \nthe child and paying voluntary child support. Eventually, the \nparties disagreed as to the amount of a mother-demanded \nincrease in child support, and she on January 28, 1999, filed \nthe paternity/support action to which this petition pertains. \nPetitioner counterclaimed and was granted court-ordered \ncustodial and visitation rights, as well as an Order of \nLegitimization.\n\n\nOnly thereafter was Petitioner advised by third \nparties of the possibility that he was not the father. He \nsecured a DNA test, and his non-paternity was confirmed. \nMother then demanded a second, independent DNA test, \nwhich resulted in the same outcome. She and her counsel \nstipulated to temporary cessation of child support, but when \nPetitioner refused to absolve her of reimbursement of the \napproximately $40,000 he had already paid for a child that \nwas not his, she and her counsel resisted the entire new-trial \nprocedure. The order, to which this Petition pertains, \nperpetuates the de-facto baseless child support order and \nlegitimization.\n\nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE WRIT\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Superior Court of DeKalb County committed \nfundamental error at law, in denying to Applicant, based \nupon purported lack of \"due diligence\" a new trial of Child \nSupport and Legitimization based upon newly discovered \nDNA evidence of non-paternity.\n\nLack of de-facto biological paternity deprives the \nSuperior Court ab initio of subject matter jurisdiction to \nassess statutory child support from the non-father, or to enter \nor perpetuate an order of legitimization as to the non-father. \nThe Court of Appeals and the State Supreme Court both \ncommitted fundamental error at law, in denying the \nApplication for Discretionary Appeal, founded on lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction, thereby creating a sub silentio \nratification and perpetuation of the trial court's exercise of \nnon-existent subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n1.\nEvery cognizant State Court, when presented with \nuncontroverted, credible genetic testing evidence of non-\npaternity, is required to render void for want of subject \nmatter jurisdiction, the previous, underlying, judgment of \npaternity.\n\nThe Petitioner should have been routinely, and \nmandatorily, allowed to proceed with his motion for new \ntrial because it attacked a previous final judgment which \ndealt with paternity and child support, and was based on \nevidence which was discovered after the Superior Court's \nFinal Order. (FN1,2.)\n\nFootnote 1: See Roddenberry v. Roddenberry, 255 Ga. 715, (1986)\n\nFootnote 2: \"On an extraordinary motion for a new trial based on newly\ndiscovered evidence, it is incumbent on the movant to satisfy the court: (1)\nthat the newly discovered evidence had come to his knowledge since the\ntrial; (2)that want of due diligence was not the reason that the evidence\nwas not \nacquired sooner; (3) that the evidence was so material that it would \nprobably produce a different verdict; (4) that it is not cumulative only; \n(5) that the affidavit of the witness is attached to the motion or its \nabsence accounted for; and (6) that the new evidence does not operate \nsolely to impeach the credit of a witness.\" Human Resources v. \nBrowning,  210 Ga.App 546, 547 (1993).\n\nThe trial court wrongfully denied the new trial, by \nfinding that Petitioner had failed to exercise due diligence. \nMore specifically, lack of due diligence was attributed by the \nTrial Court to Petitioner's failure to earlier avail himself of a \nDNA test on litigative occasions when Petitioner earnestly \nand in good faith believed himself to be the biological father, \nin reliance upon Mother's fraudulent withholding from him \nof information to the contrary.\n\nPetitioner had no reason to believe that he was not \nthe father of the minor child since the Mother repeatedly \nassured him that he was in fact the biological father. \nTherefore his duty of \"due diligence\" did not begin until \nafter he had first been alerted by third parties that he might \nnot be the only male to have been sexually active with the \nMother during the period when the child could have been \nconceived. Petitioner initiated a DNA test promptly after \nbeing so alerted. (FN3) \n\nFootnote 3: \"Where a purported father has no reason to suspect the fidelity\nof the mother, it may not be unreasonable, and in fact may be admirable, for \nhim to acknowledge his paternity without further proof thereof. The law \nshould not punish a purported father for failing to insist on a paternity \ntest when he has no reason to believe that he is not the father. A contrary \nrule would invite suspicion and distrust, and essentially require all \npurported fathers, upon divorce or separation to accuse their spouses or \npartners of infidelity by demanding proof of paternity.\" Smith v. \nDepartment of Human Resources, 226 Ga.App 491, 493 (1997).\n\n\nThe trial court extrapolated that the mere fact of \nseparation of the parties gave to Petitioner \"... knowledge, at \nthe time he was informed of the pregnancy, that the parties \nwere no longer in a monogamous relationship and therefore \nhe was on notice that he might not be the father\". Order, \nAppendix C, p.3 (original numbering), lines 19-22. Nothing \nin the trial record supports such judicial extrapolation. It is a \nnon-sequitur. This court should take judicial notice that \ncohabiting couples, married or not, are not necessarily \nbehaving monogamously, and further, that couples who \nseparate are not necessarily thrust into a libertine lifestyle. \nSuch judicial extrapolation should be deemed an abuse of \ndiscretion.\n\nThe Petitioner was repeatedly assured by the Mother \nthat he was the biological father of the minor child. The \nMother voluntarily withheld information that would have \ncaused the Petitioner to doubt the fact that he was the father \nof the minor child.\n\nThe admitted fact that the Mother required assistance \nof a physician to \"determine\" (without contemporaneous \nDNA or any blood testing) that \"Mr. Smith was the Father\", \nincluding the counting of days relative to missed \nmenstruation, is probative of the Mother, Toni Odum \nknowing from the very beginning of her pregnancy that there \nwere two potential fathers. Her \"physician's assistance\" in \nher \"determination\" would have been unnecessary had \nPetitioner been the only man with whom she had \ncontemporaneously engaged in intercourse, casting doubt \nupon her professed certainty as to actual paternity.\nProvided with the information that he was not the father \nof the child, Petitioner would never have been ordered by the \nSuperior Court to pay child support and he would never had \nagreed to voluntarily pay child support for more than ten \n(10) years. The evidence of non-paternity would have \nprevented the Mother from obtaining child support from the \nPetitioner.\n\nThe Mother committed fraud against the Superior \nCourt in several respects:\n\nFirst, by failing to disclose the possibility of another \nfather, she created an omission from the record of the final \nhearing. \n\nSecond, the Petitioner innocently relied on this \nomission to his detriment. For more than ten (10) years, \nbased upon false pretenses advocated by the Mother, the \nPetitioner provided the Mother with over forty thousand \ndollars ($40,000.00) in child support.  (FN4) \n\nFootnote 4: See Gary v. E. Frank Miller Construction Co., Inc., \n208 Ga.App. 73 (1993).\n\nThird, the Petitioner reasonably relied on the \nMother's assertion that he was the biological father of the \nminor child. The Petitioner had no reason to believe that he \nwas not the father of the minor child, and the Mother never \ninformed him of the possibility that he may not be the father \nof said child.  (FN5)\n\nFootnote 5: See Barret v. Independent Order of Foresters, \n625 F.2d 73 (5th Cir. 1980).\n\nThroughout the proceedings below, Petitioner \npersisted in misinterpreting the claimed \"advice by \nPetitioner's Counsel\" to \"secure a DNA test\". Nowhere does \nthe Mother show such purported attorney advice to arise \nfrom any factually-based suspicion of non-paternity. The \nCourt may take judicial notice that a proposal to seek DNA \nevidence is nowadays likely to be a routine procedural \nsuggestion made by every attorney defending his client \nagainst child support obligation in any paternity case.\n\nTo become aware of the public availability of DNA \ntesting, from a billboard or by suggestion by counsel, is not \nthe onset of a duty of due diligence. It is the realization, for \nthe first time, that facts exist probative of a different man \nbeing the father, that should be the trigger for a fresh duty of \ndue diligence.\n\n\nII.\nUpon a finding by the cognizant State Court that a previous \njudgment of paternity is void, that Court must Order the \nrefund to the newly-proven non-father, of all child support, \nwhether court ordered or voluntarily paid while under \nmistaken belief of paternity, collection expenses, and court \nexpenses.\n\nAs a direct result of the fraud, the Plaintiff was forced \nto relinquish a very substantial amount of money to the \nMother, which has inflicted a grave financial harm to him. (FN 6,7)\n\nFootnote 6: See Haynes v. Fincher, 241 Ga.App. 179 (1999).\n\nFootnote 7:  \"It is a well recognized principle that one may not retain\nmoney or \ngoods which have come into (her) hands through mistake and which \n(she) is not, in good conscience, entitled to retain.\" Department of \nMedical Assistance v. Presbyterian Home, Inc. 200 Ga.App. 885, 887. \n\nThe Plaintiff fraudulently obtained over forty \nthousand dollars ($40,000.00) from the Defendant through \ndeceit. When misrepresentation of a material fact has \noccurred by one of the parties, then legal fraud has occurred \nand the party can recover damages based on that fraud. (FN 8)\n\nFootnote 8: See Morton v. W.T. Tharpe & Co., 41 Ga.App 788 (1930).\n\nTherefore, the Plaintiff should not be allowed to profit from \nthe fraud she perpetrated against the Court and the Defendant \nshould be allowed to recover from the Plaintiff the damages \nhe incurred due to her fraud. (FN 9)\n\nFootnote 9: See Price v. Mitchell, 154 Ga.App. 523 (1980).\n    \nLack of de-facto biological paternity deprives the \nSuperior Court ab initio of subject matter jurisdiction to \nassess statutory child support from the non-father, or to enter \nor perpetuate an order of legitimization as to the non-father. \nThe trial court found, at Order, Appendix C,  p.3, \nlines 14-18, that:\n\"... the Consent Order of Legitimization and Child \nCustody established paternity and legitimated the \nchild of these parties.\"\n\nThat cannot be so. Legitimization can only be \naccomplished by the biological father. Petitioner is \nabsolutely not that person. (FN 10)\n\nFootnote 10: See Clements v. Phillips, 235 Ga.App. 588, \n510 S.E.2d 311 (Ga.App. 12/03/1998)\n \nThere is no doubt that the DeKalb County Court \nacquired personal jurisdiction over the Mother by her filing \nof the paternity action, and over Petitioner, by service of \nprocess. But personal jurisdiction does not form a foundation \nfor subject matter jurisdiction. Since Petitioner is not a \nbiological parent of the subject child, the Paternity Statutes \ndo not vest the Superior Court with subject matter \njurisdiction to order the non-parent Petitioner to pay child \nsupport, nor does that court have subject matter jurisdiction \nto order a \"Legitimation\" regarding, or initiated erroneously \nby, a non-parent.\n\nThe Superior Court's subject matter jurisdiction to \nassess child support against an \"unwed father\" does not exist \nwhen such a defendant is not the de-facto biological father. \nThe Georgia legislature granted power to the Superior Court \nin paternity cases to determine contested paternity, but did \nnot grant power (subject matter jurisdiction) to make any \nchild-related paternity orders impinging upon a non-parent. \n\nSubject matter jurisdiction cannot be created where it \ndoes not exist, nor is it created by agreement or waiver. (FN 11)\n\nFootnote 11: \"...Must a judgment already rendered be set aside because of an \nalleged structural error to which the losing party did not properly object? \nThere is no reason in principle why that should always be so. It will \nsometimes be so - not, however, because the error was structural, but \nbecause, whether structural or not, it deprived the [federal] court of its \nrequisite subject-matter jurisdiction. Such an error may be raised by a \nparty, and indeed must be noticed sua sponte by a court, at all points in \nthe litigation, see, e. g., American Fire & Casualty Co. v. Finn, 341 \nU.S. 6, 17-18 (1951); Mansfield, C. & L. M. R. Co. v. Swan, 111 U.S. \n379, 382 (1884); Capron v. Van Noorden, 2 Cranch 126, 127 (1804).\" \nFreytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.S. 868 (1991) JUSTICE SCALIA, with \nwhom JUSTICE O'CONNOR, JUSTICE KENNEDY, and JUSTICE \nSOUTER join, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. \n(emphasis supplied)\n\nAs the U.S. Supreme Court indicated in Freytag, id., \nthe issue of Subject Matter Jurisdiction not only may be \nraised at any time, all courts have an affirmative duty to \nexamine the issue when it is raised by a party, or sua sponte. \nPurported lack of \"due diligence\" by a litigant does not \naffect that affirmative duty. The Court of Appeals or State \nSupreme Court should not be permitted to sub silentio ratify \nthe trial court's jurisdictionally defective exercise of power to \ncontinue application of a mistaken child support order \nagainst a non-father.\n\nIndeed, the Court of Appeals and State Supreme \nCourt lack power to so ratify on a theory that Petitioner \nCarnell Smith \"waived\" by purported lack of \"due diligence\" \nhis right to seek the setting aside of the manifestly baseless \nchild support order. (FN12)\n\nFootnote 12: \"Since such a jurisdictional defect deprives not only the\ninitial court but also the appellate court of its power over the case or\ncontroversy, to \npermit the appellate court to ignore it because of waiver would be to give \nthe waiver legitimating, as opposed to merely remedial, effect, i. e., the \neffect of approving, ex ante, unlawful action by the appellate court \nitself.\" Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.S. 868 (1991), id. JUSTICE \nSCALIA, with whom JUSTICE O'CONNOR, JUSTICE KENNEDY, \nand JUSTICE SOUTER join, concurring in part and concurring in the \njudgment.\n \nWhen paternity is declared, legitimization is ordered, \nor child support is imposed, and the Court becomes aware of \ndispositive evidence of biological non-paternity, a decision \nsuch as that herein, denying retrial on the basis of alleged \nlack of due diligence, violates the court's duty of \njurisdictional self-examination. Just as the execution of a \ncriminal defendant known before the execution to be \ninnocent is an affront to our Constitution, the maintenance of \na manifest fiction in order to perpetuate a financial obligation \nand avoid \"delegitimization\" of a child violates the \nFourteenth Amendment rights not only of the non-father, but \nalso the substantive rights of the child. (FN13)\n\nFootnote 13: \"It goes without saying that a child has an interest in not being \nlegitimated by someone who is not his father. See, e.g., In re Ashmore, \n163 Ga. App. 194, 195 (1) (293 SE2d 457) (1982) (any interested party \nmay file objection to legitimization petition). The fact that the mother \nwas a participant in a fraudulent scheme to have the child wrongfully \nlegitimated does not lessen this interest. Legitimation is not a game, and \nthe child is not the prize.\" Clements v. Phillips, id. 235 Ga.App. 588, 510 \nS.E.2d 311 (Ga.App. 12/03/1998)\n\nAlthough there was initially an assumption herein by the \nSuperior Court that it had acquired Subject Matter \nJurisdiction by virtue of the Petitioner's voluntary agreement \nto such a declaration of status, once proof of non-paternity is \npresented, the Superior Court must, however reluctantly, \nadmit that it never actually had subject matter jurisdiction. \nGranting a new trial is not discretionary in such \ncircumstances, to rectify the mistaken previous judgments \nand orders; it is necessary in the interests of justice. (FN 14)\n\nFootnote 14:  \"...I write separately to point out the \nabsurdity of the present state of \nthe law that requires a putative father to pay child support after he has \nscientifically proven that he is not the biological father. As I stated in \nSmith v. Department of Human Resources, 226 Ga. App. 491, 493 (487 \nSE2d 94) (1997), 'the law should not punish a purported father for failing \nto insist on a paternity test when he has no reason to believe that he is not \nthe father.' Not only has the putative father been cuckolded, the law adds \ninjury to insult by requiring him to pay child support even after he \nestablishes that he is not the biological father. Once non-paternity is \nscientifically established, courts cannot ignore such fact by relying on \npolicies developed when no such proof was possible. To create a fiction \nin this matter does not make the male the biological father of the child; it \nsimply makes him the victim of the law. It also makes an ass of the \nlaw....While the courts may preach their false policy, they lose the \nrespect of any citizen with common sense\" Georgia Department of \nHuman Resources v. Pinter, 241 Ga.App. 10, 525 S.E.2d 715 (Ga.App. \n11/18/1999) BLACKBURN, Presiding Judge, specially Concurring.\n\n\nO.C.G.A. 19-7-40 clearly provides that the Superior \nCourt and the state courts have jurisdiction of paternity and \nchild support. But once there is proof of non-paternity of the \nnon-father, neither the Superior Court nor the state appellate \ncourts remain vested with Subject Matter Jurisdiction \nregarding him to require, assess, or perpetuate child support.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court, earlier in the \npresent 2001-2002 term, denied Certiorari in a Texas-based \ncase wherein review solely invoking the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution had been \ndenied to a divorced man. He had discovered, via post \ndivorce health-related blood testing, that he was not the \nbiological father of multiple children born during the \nmarriage. While the divorced man did not, as herein, raise \nlack of subject matter jurisdiction in his Certiorari Petition, \nhe recited a number of valuable cases showing proper post-\ndecree reversal of paternity findings and monetary \nconsequences in States other than Texas. (FN 15)\n\nFootnote 15: Wise v. Fryar, Petition for Writ of Certiorari, U.S. Supreme \nCourt No. 01-562, cert.den., which cited, among others, the following cases:\nWhite v. Armstrong, 1999 WL 33085 (Tenn. Ct.App 1/27/99);\nDe Filippis v. United States, 567 Fed.2d 341, 343-44 (7th Cir. 1977);\nUnited States v.

That does not mean that the court does not \nstill have a task to perform in rectifying its previous error. \nWhile the Superior Court manifestly lacks Subject Matter \nJurisdiction over matters of current or future support \nregarding Petitioner in this case, it retains personal \njurisdiction over the Mother, for having caused Petitioner to \nbe damaged through jurisdictionally defective invocation of \nthe Court's power.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nPetitioner, having been subjected to provably void \nSubject Matter Jurisdiction, has standing to raise a facial \nchallenge against that exercise. Invalidation on constitutional \ngrounds goes directly to the power of a Court to hear, try, \nand adjudicate a matter wholly based upon an ab initio lack \nof the necessary biological relationship by which a de facto \nfather is constitutionally made a party to a paternity action. \nPetitioner lacks the capacity to \"forfeit\" the question of \nsubject matter jurisdiction. He can, and has, properly and \nexpeditiously raised the issue for the first time in the trial \ncourt, and at every appellate level thereafter. He could have \nraised it for the first time in seeking Certiorari.\nFor the foregoing reasons, Petitioner should not have \nbeen denied re-opening of the Paternity, Support and \nLegitimation case.\nThe United States Supreme Court should choose \nwhichever of the remedies sought herein it deems \nappropriate, and either grant Certiorari and then upon \nbriefing and argument, reverse the Georgia Supreme Court's \ndenial of Discretionary Appeal, or more directly use its own \noriginal discretion to grant a Discretionary Appeal.\nUpon recognition of the jurisdictional principles \nargued herein, this Court may short circuit any extended \nappellate proceedings and fashion such direct remedies it \ndeems reasonable, including but not limited to directly \nordering the Superior Court to reopen proceedings so as to \nstop the child support order, and order that \nPetitioner/Applicant be fully compensated for the more than \n$40,000 fraudulently received by Mother , plus costs.\n\n\nRespectfully submitted this 9th. day of April, 2002.\n\n___________________________\nCarnell A.

SMITH\t      )   FILE NO.  98-12744-9\n\tDefendant\t\t)\n\n\t\t\tO R D E R \n\nThe above-styled case came before the Court for a \nhearing on April 16, 2001 on  Defendant's \"extraordinary \nMotion and Brief for New Trial to Set Aside Child Support \nand Grant Defendant Relief Based on the Plaintiff's \nPerpetrating Fraud Upon the Court band Defendant\" as \namended. Both parties were present and represented by \ncounsel. The Court has considered and reviewed the file, the \nmotion and response, and has heard evidence and argument \nof counsel.\n\nProcedural History\nOn December 17, 1998, Plaintiff filed a verified \nComplaint to Establish Paternity and Set Child Support \npro se, although she later retained counsel. On January 28, \n1999, Defendant, represented by counsel, filed a verified \nAnswer and Counterclaim for Legitimation. The parties \npresented the Court with a Consent Order of Legitimation \nand Child Custody signed by both parties and their \nrespective counsel, which the Court signed and filed on July \n29, 1999. That same day, the Court signed and filed a second \norder for temporary child support and visitation. On \nFebruary 29, 2000, the case came for trial on the issues of \nchild support and visitation; after a lengthy bench trial at \nwhich both parties testified, the Court signed and filed an \norder on March 2, 2000 setting visitation and ordering child \nsupport of $750.00 per month. On March 31, 2000, \nDefendant, the father, filed \"Defendant's Motion to Modify \nor in the Alternative Motion for reconsideration of the Final \nOrder\" asking the Court to allow him more visitation with \nthe child. A hearing on that motion was scheduled but \ncanceled at Defendant's request. On August 28, 2000, \nDefendant filed the motion now before the Court and \ninformally requested time for the parties to undergo genetic \ntesting to determine the paternity of the child.\n\nFindings of Fact\nIt is undisputed that the history of the relationship is \nas follows: the parties, who were dating but not living \ntogether, considered themselves to be in a monogamous \nrelationship until Defendant told Plaintiff that he wanted to \ndate other women; after some time had passed and the \nparties were no longer dating, Plaintiff informed Defendant \nthat she was pregnant with his child. It is undisputed that the \nchild was born in December 1988.\nAt the hearing, Plaintiff testified that she always \nconsidered Defendant to be the father of the child because \nshe had physical indications of possible pregnancy \nimmediately after the parties had stopped seeing each other, \nbefore she was intimate with anyone else. Plaintiff testified \nthat she did not know until she received the results of the \npaternity test in the year 2000 that Defendant was not and \ncould not be the father of this child. Defendant testified that \nPlaintiff told him she was pregnant and he was the father of \nthe child some time after the parties stopped dating each \nother, at a time when he considered himself free to date other \nwomen and he considered Plaintiff to be free to date other \nmen. Defendant testified that, when  he retained an attorney \nto represent him at the onset of this paternity action, that \nattorney advised him to take a paternity test and he said no.\nThe Court finds that the Consent Order of \nLegitimation and Child Custody established paternity and \nlegitimated the child of these parties. The Court finds that \nDefendant has abandoned his Motion to Modify regarding \nadditional visitation, as he is now asking this Court to relieve \nhim of the duties of fatherhood.\n\nThe Court finds Defendant had knowledge, at the \ntime he was informed of the pregnancy, that the parties were \nno longer in a monogamous relationship and therefore \nDefendant was on notice that he might not be the father. The \nCourt finds that Defendant knew he could request a paternity \ntest before he counterclaimed to legitimate this child, but did \nnot do so. The Court finds that Defendant did not exercise \ndue diligence in ascertaining paternity of the child and that \nDefendant's want of due diligence was the reason the newly \ndiscovered evidence of paternity was not known to him \nsooner.\n\nLegal Standard\nThe Georgia Supreme Court held that extraordinary \nmotions for a new trial on the basis of newly available \nevidence are not favored: The requirements for granting an \nextraordinary motion for a new trial are clear. On an \nextraordinary motion for a new trial based on newly \ndiscovered evidence, it is incumbent that the movant satisfy \nthe court: (1) that the newly discovered evidence has come to \nhis knowledge since the trial; (2) that want of due diligence \nwas not the reason that the evidence was not acquired \nsooner; (3) that the evidence was so material that it would \nprobably produce a different verdict; (4) that it is not \ncumulative onlt; (5) that the affidavit of the witness is \nattached to the motion or its absence accounted for; and (6) \nthat the new evidence does not operate solely to impeach the \ncredit of a witness. [Cits. and punctuation omitted] Patterson \nv. Whitehead, 224 Ga. App. 636, 638(3) (1997), citing \nRoddenberry v. Roddenberry, 255 Ga. 715, 717 (1986).\n\nConclusions of Law\nDefendant has not proven, by a preponderance of \nevidence, that Plaintiff perpetrated fraud upon him or this \nCourt. Defendant is not entitled to a grant of a new trial \nbased on newly discovered evidence because he failed to \nexercise due diligence in acquiring such evidence timely. \nRoddenberry, supra. Therefore Defendant's \"Extraordinary \nMotion and Brief for New Trial to Set Aside Child Support \nand Grant Defendant Relief Based on the Plaintiff \nPerpetrating Fraud Upon this Court and Defendant\":, as \namended, is DENIED.\n\nSO ORDERED this 14 day of May, 2001.\n\n/s/ Edward A.

The Post noted that over the last three years the Interfaith Climate and Energy Campaign, a project of the National Council of Churches and the Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life, has set up groups in 21 states to promote conservation and the use of cleaner fuels.\n\nFor its part the National Religious Partnership for the Environment wrote an open letter to automobile company executives urging them to build cleaner cars, the Christian Science Monitor reported Nov. 22. The letter noted the call made in Scripture to be stewards of creation. In the light of global warming, \"we're not doing well by this covenant,\" said Rabbi David Saperstein, head of Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism.\n\nThe initiative sparked off a lively debate, with some criticizing the religious groups for undue involvement in political and social issues. The Washington Times noted Nov. 29 that some critics accused the activists behind the campaign of \"promoting pagan earth worship and pushing an agenda that has more to do with politics than prayer.\"\n\nThe article noted that Paul Gormon, founder and executive director of the National Religious Partnership for the Environment, cut his teeth as a speechwriter for Senator Eugene McCarthy's 1968 anti-war campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nOthers active in founding the partnership include U.S. Senator James Jeffords of Vermont and then-Senator Tim Wirth of Colorado. Wirth is now president of Ted Turner's U.N. Foundation, which supports population-control programs.\n\nWriting in the Los Angeles Times of Jan. 6, Auden Schendler, director of environmental affairs for Aspen Skiing Company, explained why people are concerned about SUVs. According to Schendler, every gallon of gasoline burned is estimated to put 20 pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. A 5-mile-per-gallon increment in improved fuel economy would keep 10 tons of carbon dioxide from being released over the lifetime of a vehicle. He also noted that SUVs emit 30% more carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons and 75% more nitrogen oxides than standard passenger cars.\n\nMany people, he commented, don't drive SUVs \"because they're bad human beings,\" but rather \"because there are no comparably priced options with better gas mileage that offer equivalent safety, convenience, performance and comfort.\"\n\nAiding terrorism?\n\nA more extreme form of opposition to SUVs is that espoused by the Earth Liberation Front. Members of this radical green group had claimed responsibility for a fire at a Pennsylvania auto dealership, the Associated Press reported Jan. 4. A statement on the ELF Web site said the \"attack\" targeted SUVs in a fight \"to remove the profit motive from the killing of the natural environment.\"\n\nViolence is also on the minds of those promoting a campaign scheduled to kick off Sunday, Jan. 12, the Wall Street Journal reported Jan. 8. On Sunday the Detroit Project, a coalition headed by columnist Arianna Huffington, is scheduled to begin airing TV ads in several U.S. cities, accusing SUVs of leading to higher U.S. imports of oil.\n\nThe oil imported by the United States, alleges the ad, comes from countries that help finance anti-American terrorists. SUV owners, says the argument, are thus guilty of indirectly supporting terror groups, by sending more money to these countries.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal observed that the auto industry loves SUVs because the profit on each vehicle sold can reach up to $10,000. One in four vehicles sold last year in the United States was an SUV, said the Journal, citing statistics from Autodata Corporation, an industry research firm.\n\nA Christian view\n\nJust how justified is religious-based concern over environmental problems? John Paul II has clearly (and repeatedly) expressed his worry over ecological matters. His message for World Day for Peace 1990 noted that \"there is a growing awareness that world peace is threatened not only by the arms race, regional conflicts and continued injustices among peoples and nations, but also by a lack of due respect for nature, by the plundering of natural resources and by a progressive decline in the quality of life.\"\n\nTheology, philosophy and science, the Pope observed, \"all speak of a harmonious universe, of a 'cosmos' endowed with its own integrity, its own internal, dynamic balance.\" \"The human race,\" he continued, \"is called to explore this order, to examine it with due care and to make use of it while safeguarding its integrity.\"\n\nEcological problems, he noted, are often due to greed and selfishness, which \"are contrary to the order of creation, an order which is characterized by mutual interdependence.\" Caring for the ecology should lead society to take \"a serious look at its lifestyle,\" said the Pope. \"In many parts of the world society is given to instant gratification and consumerism while remaining indifferent to the damage which these cause.\"\n\nThis concern of the Pope goes a lot deeper than ecologists' concerns about banning gas guzzlers. The ecological problem \"is not simply economic and technological; it is moral and spiritual,\" declared the statement on ecological matters signed by the Pope and the patriarch of Constantinople last June 10.\n\n\"A genuine conversion in Christ will enable us to change the way we think and act,\" noted the document. We must be humble, recognizing the limits of our power, knowledge and judgment, it continued. \"A new approach and a new culture are needed, based on the centrality of the human person within creation and inspired by environmentally ethical behavior stemming from our triple relationship to God, to self and to creation.\"\n\nIn the past, some critics of Christianity have argued that its focus on the human person leads to a disregard for the environment. But, in his address to the World Summit on Sustainable Development last Sept. 2, Archbishop Renato Martino, head the Holy See delegation to the meeting, stated: \"Placing human well-being at the center of concern for the environment is actually the surest way of safeguarding creation.\"\n\nPromoting human dignity will lead to defending the right to development and also the right to a healthy environment, explained Archbishop Martino. The defense of these rights will, in turn, stimulate \"the responsibility of the individual toward self, toward others, toward creation, and ultimately toward God.\"\n\nThis responsibility will also imply, he observed, the practice of global solidarity. This solidarity among peoples involves promoting the common good and being attentive to the needs of others.\n\nChurch teaching, then, does not stipulate what sort of car we should drive. It asks a lot more than that. It asks us to defend a genuine human ecology, based on humility and respect for God and creation. In turn, each individual has to answer in his own conscience what this means for his lifestyle.\n\nZE03011803\n\n===================================================\nZENIT is an International News Agency. \n\nTo receive ZENIT News Services by e-mail, FREE Subscription at:\nhttp://www.zenit.org/english/subscribe.html\n\nFor reprint permission, please contact infoenglish@zenit.org. \nVisit our web page at http://www.zenit.org/ \n\nSEND US YOUR NEWS: \nPlease send press releases, statements and other information to our international news desk at:\nnews@zenit.org. \nCopyright (c) - Innovative Media, Inc.\n===================================================\n\t \n You can send this news to a friend at the following link:\n http://www.zenit.org/english/send_friend/forward_amico.phtml?mittente=jeb@jeb.org&sid=30126\n"

I believe, and the President acknowledged today, that the federal budget needs to be passed so local Homeland Security programs can receive some relief, but there is a bigger message which I feel needs to be stated.\n \nIn the month after Sept. 11th, I issued a hiring slowdown, followed later in the year by a significant reduction in non-uniform force, accomplished completely through attrition (no one lost a job); our departments tightened their belts considerably and returned significant budgeted funds back to the general fund, unspent, at the end of the year.  We continued to improve services (new pool; new libraries, new athletic fields; quicker sidewalk and pothole repairs; increased compensation for police and fire; etc); we established a Homeland Security team revising emergency plans, reviewing facility hardening and conducting biological and chemical terrorism exercises for Florida's west coast (with support of the DOJ); we absorbed the worst combination of cost increases and revenue losses that the city's long-time staff can recall; and we ended the year without raising real estate taxes but with an unexpected moderate general fund YTD surplus for Florida's 4th largest city.\n \nI am not saying that we are the best run city or that the future will be easy.  In fact I believe that next year's city budgets may be even harder, and I hope you will keep this fact in mind in your State budget deliberations.  My point is that there are many in America's cities who recognize that we have a responsibility to lead beyond simply asking others for help; who support the President's domestic and foreign programs; who believe that there is a federal funding role for Homeland Security issues but also recognize that we have to assume greater responsibility; and who feel it is our duty to prepare our community, through fiscal management and security measures, so that the burden on our federal government will be lessened, especially in a time of war.\n \nWhen the President spoke to the mayors at the White House this morning I was hoping to make this point, but time did not allow for questions or comments.  If you ever have an opportunity to pass along my thoughts I believe it would be helpful for him to know.\n \nGod bless\n \nRick\n \n\n\n \n\n"

We just started a club at the Wayne Densch Center here in Eatonville.  They have secured an entire apartment project that is for homeless families.  The parents are so proud to have their teens involved with such a positive anti-tobacco program, and we are excited about this site.\n\nMy program here in Orange has been funding anti-tobacco projects for church youth groups ever since I have been Tobacco Prevention Coordinator.  A portion of my funding goes to local churches to provide anti-tobacco information to their teens. We did an Anti-Tobacco Night at House of Hope--which was well-received.\n\nI have always worked in the inner city--ever since \"Project Three\" days.  In addition, I have an active Tobacco-Free Partnership with many members in the community who are dedicated to helping our youth.  \n\nOne member, Pastor Thompson, has a unique program which we are funding:  Teens who are suspended from school for tobacco violations are hanging around his church all day.  We are providing funding for a three hour per day--three day per week program to teach an \"Anti-tobacco Reading Program.\"   to these teens in the streets. We are working with Evans 9th Grade Principal and the minister.\n\nI am active here with all non-profits--so please have  Liza McFadden contact me if she needs any help in Orlando.  \n\nHopefully, you are still considering having a \"Governor's Office of Non-Profits\"--or is this it?  I know of a foundation in Jacksonville that gave a million dollars to North Carolina office to create such a project.\n\nWe need one office that would list all non-profits while highlighting their mission.  This would be a great benefit to these smaller agencies as well as all  non-profits. It is difficult and expensive for non-profits to advertise.\n\nWe also have a large Grants Professional Network as well as Philanthropy Center here at Rollins College.  There are so many resources that need to be empowered and promoted statewide.\n\nWell--as usual, all the best, thanks  and many  Prayers for you and your family.\n\nLoved the Christmas Card--Thank you.\n\nFor Liza:\nFonda McGowan, MS\nOffice of Tobacco\n407-623-1180 ext. 191 \n\n"

I'm chair of the national\norganization for state college chancellors this year and all of them are\ntelling horror stories of cuts this year. \n\nGray Davis has proposed a $530 million cut in community colleges alone, and\na doubling of tuition. (see article below from Chronicle of Higher\nEducation.) \n\nStill, we'll keep working to see if we can get the enrollment funding up if\nthe legislature can find the money, but I know that will be tough. We\nappreciate your comments about your wish that there were more funds for\nenrollment.\n\nFinally, I'm very excited about the role we can play in addressing class\nsize. Through more dual enrollment and charter schools at community colleges\nwe can help with enrollment, and with Student Success as well.\n\nDavid \n\n\nFrom the issue dated January 24, 2003\n\n \n\nCalifornia Governor Seeks Deep Budget Cuts and Doubling of Tuition at\nCommunity Colleges\nBy JAMILAH EVELYN\n\nJust as they were preparing for sizable midyear cuts in state\nappropriations, community-college leaders in California were blindsided this\nmonth by a second dose of bad news. Gov. Gray Davis proposed doubling\ntuition and slashing the colleges' funds again in 2003-4 to help offset what\nis expected to be a $35-billion state-budget deficit.\n\nTake almost the entire undergraduate population of the University of\nCalifornia -- some 146,000 students -- and that is how many people will be\nshut out of the two-year colleges, those officials say, if the governor's\nproposal is approved by the Legislature this summer.\n\nThe state's community colleges enroll a total of about 2.4 million students.\n\nThe plan would reduce appropriations for community colleges by some\n$530-million, or 10.5 percent. Although the state's two other systems -- the\nUniversity of California and California State University -- sustained cuts\nof their own, community-college leaders point out that those institutions\nare raising tuition and those dollars will stay on the campuses, helping to\noffset the cuts the governor has proposed for them. Community colleges must\ngive their tuition dollars to the state. The net result has\ncommunity-college leaders crying foul.\n\nEven Thomas J. Nussbaum, chancellor of the 108-college system, who is\nusually reserved in expressing opposition to the state administration, is\nspeaking up. \"We have a struggling economy and a huge need to create\nadditional jobs, and the community colleges are the state's largest\nwork-force providers,\" he told The San Diego Union-Tribune. \"So what are we\ndoing here?\"\n\nLeaders of every state agency say they were prepared for significant cuts,\nbut community-college officials say they were caught off guard by what they\nsee as the disproportionate cutting of their budget. The proposal has\nsparked a vigorous political debate, with community-college leaders and\nothers accusing the governor of making the state's neediest residents bear\nthe brunt of the budget crunch.\n\n\"Give me a fair cut and I'll take it,\" says Kevin M. Ramirez, president of\nSierra College, who is also president of the Chief Executive Officers of the\nCalifornia Community Colleges. \"But don't aim at students who are already\nmarginalized by higher education. That's a classist mistake.\"\n\n'Pay More, Get Less'\n\nThe spending plan could actually lower appropriations for community colleges\nbelow what state law allows. It would reduce reimbursements for\nfull-time-equivalent students to $4,026, from $4,684. The governor, who had\ncut community-college tuition twice during the economic boom of the late\n1990s, has also proposed raising tuition to $24 per credit hour, from $11. \n\n\"He's proposing to ask students to pay twice as much and get a lot less,\"\nsays Scott M. Lay, director of state-budget issues for the Community College\nLeague of California, which represents presidents and boards of trustees.\n\nWhen community-college tuition was increased in the early 1990s, enrollment\nfell roughly 1 percent for every dollar that tuition rose. Estimates of how\nmany students would either drop out or choose not to enroll because of the\nnew tuition proposal and reductions in programs have varied from 45,000 to\nnearly three times that number.\n\nThe governor, a Democrat, acknowledged that his proposal would keep some\nstudents out of the two-year colleges. Accordingly, he cut their state\nappropriations for 2003-4 to take the decline into account.\n\nPresidents of two-year colleges are calling the plan the toughest financial\nchallenge they've ever been through. \n\nMany had already decided to suspend dual-enrollment programs, which allow\nhigh-school students to take college classes, and to eliminate most, if not\nall, of their summer courses after Mr. Davis last year called for a\n10-percent cut in the $6.5-billion designated for community colleges in\n2002-3.\n\nNow, with the governor's new budget proposal for the next academic year,\ncommunity-college leaders are predicting significant reductions in their\nacademic offerings and possible faculty and staff layoffs.\n\nAt Sierra, Mr. Ramirez says, he has already eliminated 350 course sections,\ncut most courses that did not enroll more than 20 students, deferred capital\nexpenditures, and imposed a hiring freeze. After the governor's\nannouncement, the college's Board of Trustees voted to tap half of the\ninstitution's $7-million in reserves to avoid layoffs.\n\nAt Cabrillo College, the president, John D. Hurd, says he has already frozen\nhiring, clamped down on equipment upgrades, and cut back on weekend and\nevening hours in the library and computer labs. \n\nIf the governor's proposal goes through, he estimates, the college would\nlose 4 to 6 percent of its $50-million operating budget, which would mean\nletting go of adjunct instructors and reducing by up to 10 percent the\nnumber of classes the college offers.\n\nProtests Expected\n\nLegislators are expected to be busy hashing out the governor's midyear cuts\nthrough the end of the month. Meanwhile, community-college officials are\nmobilizing their constituents and calling for organized protests of next\nyear's budget proposal at the state Capitol.\n\nMr. Ramirez says he used his college's convocation last week to advise\nstudents and faculty members to lobby their state representatives to oppose\nthe cuts.\n\nIn the summer of 2001, Mr. Davis had proposed cutting $98-million from the\ncommunity-college system's budget. He later restored about one-third of that\nafter an aggressive lobbying campaign by the colleges. That success has\nofficials optimistic about persuading lawmakers to restore some of their\nfunds. State Sen. Jack Scott, a Democrat and the chairman of the education\nsubcommittee of the Budget and Fiscal Review Committee, has promised to try\nto help mitigate the cuts.\n\n\"But the reality of the state's budget does not bode well for us,\" says Mr.\nHurd. \"We're cautiously optimistic.\"\n\nThe proposal needs bipartisan support to make it through the Legislature.\nMany Republicans have already vowed to oppose the plan because it also calls\nfor tax increases for California's wealthiest residents. \n\nWhat's more, some economists say the governor has overestimated the deficit,\nwhich may help the community colleges make a case for minimizing the cuts.\n\n\"Still, for every dollar we want to restore,\" says Mr. Lay, of the\ncommunity-college league, \"we have to find that money somewhere else.\" \n\nThe Legislature is supposed to approve the annual budget by the end of June,\nbut did not do so last year until September because of wrangling over the\ngovernor's proposals. Budget discussions are expected to last until the end\nof this summer as well.\n\nhttp://chronicle.com\nSection: Government & Politics\nVolume 49, Issue 20, Page A22 \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----\n\nFront page | Career Network | Search | Site map | Help\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----\nCopyright \u00a9 2003 by The Chronicle of Higher Education\n\n\n*******************************************************************\nThis email was wirelessly enabled by Sprint PCS.

This does not include other lab\nfees etc. Out of state tuition is three times this. We are currently running\nabout 83 percent of the national average for community college tuition/fees.\nYou may have noticed that California's fees were extremely low, currently\n$11, and Davis proposes raising them to $24 a credit hour. Until a few years\nago they charged NO tuition, but I expect with their budget problems they\nwill soon be at the national average if not above.\n\nAs for state funding, we are currently providing $2,742 in GR and $322 in\nLottery per FTE for a total of $3,064 in state funds. Add to that $1,350 in\ntuition and you get to approximately $4,400 per FTE. For comparison\npurposes, that's 86 percent of total funding for SREB state community\ncollege funds of approximately $5,400 per FTE. \n\nI have attached a slide in a MS Word document that gives you a five year\nhistory of funding by fund source per FTE. You will note that we've actually\ndeclined a bit recently in actual per FTE funding from all sources, because\nour funds have not kept pace with our growth.\n\nLet me know if you want more, of if you'd like to have a quick briefing on\nall of this for your background information. Thanks again for your support.\n\nDavid\n\n\n*******************************************************************\nThis email was wirelessly enabled by Sprint PCS.

Together, I hope we can make a difference in Florida for life.\n \nSecond, thank you for supporting charter schools.  It is far more than a cliche to proclaim that our children deserve good schools.  I am fortunate to be able to provide a service to those schools.   In an interesting side note, charter schools have created three full-time jobs in Bonifay.

Caity was the third grade rep\nand Scott, the junior rep, who has a very high GPA, he is hearing\nimpaired and can't pass the FCAT without an interpreter. I was there to\nshow Caity needs the visual foundation to do abstract thinking and gave\nseveral examples of how we problem solved and also problems that arise\nin directions and rules, etc and how these are made concrete and\nvisual. Mr. Dean had never met an autistic child before, she sat for\nover an hour at a conference table with several adults and only\nquestioned the word retained. She then announced that we were all there\nto help her and Scott and even attempted some sign language for Scott.\nI told the group that Caity had a new skill we discovered last night by\naccident. If you give Caity a day and month, she will tell you all of\nthe dates in that month, for instance, \"name all the dates for Tuesday\nin November\" and she does it. She just thinks differently than all of\nus. She is still very involved with her president's card and now knows\nall the vice presidents that were under all the presidents that she\nnames. She loves the presidents and yesterday in the car, she had an\nold Time Magazine and wanted to know why John Kennedy had crutches in\nthe picture. Anyway, she also asked me why God put her here and I told\nher to teach us about autism and she was very pleased at the thought of\nbeing a teacher and I told her she taught her teachers too, and today a\nstate representative, who said he was going to visit you and mention\nCaityand Scott, in case he does visit you, she is the same Caity that I\nhave been writing to you about, and yes, she is constantly teaching\neveryone about autism. As I understand it, there will be many autistic\nchildren at the capital on February 18th. to meet their\nrepresentatives. I am not sure if we will be there or not, that would\nbe a long day and we might have homework and a day's school work to\nmake up. but you might enjoy meeting some of the children.

I understand that you are interviewing Mr. DeSerio on Saturday, February 8th in Miami.\n\n \n\nI practiced law with Mr. DeSerio for almost seven years. Mr. DeSerio is an extremely intelligent individual with strong morals and high personal integrity. He is highly dedicated to the welfare of our community, volunteering time to the needs of the homeless and to local church and community projects. \n\n \n\nMr. DeSerio is immensely experienced with the appellate process. After having been admitted to the bar in 1972 and serving as Assistant State Attorney, he has been counsel of record in over 150 reported appellate opinions and additional unreported appellate opinions. In this time, Mr. DeSerio has practiced as appellate counsel both with the State of Florida Department of Transportation and in private practice.\n\n \n\nMr. DeSerio is also objective in critical decision-making. He has authored chapters in legal publications, such as the nationally recognized Nichols on Eminent Domain and The Florida Bar\u2019s Florida Eminent Domain Practice and Procedure Manual. He has developed his skills as a respected mediator. He has served as Program Co-Chair and Program Editor in the development and presentation of eminent domain seminars at the Florida Conference of Circuit Court Judges.\n\n \n\nThese positive attributes make Mr. DeSerio uniquely qualified to serve our state as an appellate judge, and I commend his candidacy to you.\n\n \n\nOnce again, it was a pleasure meeting you this past November at the Family First dinner. By the way, Eli Ferrera contacted me and I plan to follow up with her to apply to the 13th Judicial Circuit JNC later this year when the openings arise. \n\nVery truly yours, \n\nPaul D.

Our\ntentative budget for this year is well in excess of $800m.  We are\nestablishing budget priorities within existing millage rates.  I have made\nit clear that under my tenure there will be no new positions and the agency\nwill focus on more efficient and accountable government.  Position\nreductions and reduction or elimination of unnecessary programs will also be\na central focus.  Of course, restoring the Everglades ecosystem is my top\nenvironmental priority.  Your commitment to the Everglades, as evidenced by\nyour budget proposal, is of paramount importance.\n\nI also want to update you on what is perhaps one of the most critical\ninitiatives effecting the Everglades; Phosphorus Standard Rulemaking by the\nEnvironmental Regulation Commission.\n\nI know that agricultural stakeholders have spoken to you about this rule in\nthe recent past, and as always, the environmental community stakeholders are\npulling in the other direction.  I believe the truly important issues are:\n\n1.\tThe rule must be technically viable.  In other words, must have the tech\navailable to achieve the standard.\n\n2.\tEconomic feasibility, the economic impacts of meeting any one standard\nmust be taken into consideration.\n\n3.\tThe standard must not render the District in violation when it comes into\neffect.\n\nGovernor, hang in there.  I know this upcoming legislative session will be\nquite challenging.  You remain in my prayers.\n\nFondest personal regards,\n\nTrudi\n\nTrudi Williams, PE\nCEO\nTKW Consulting Engineers, Inc.\n239-278-1992 (office)\n239-278-0922 (fax)\n\n\n"

Governor Bush\n\nI would like to suggest why my application for appointment to the Southeast Volusia Hospital District Board should not be negatively affected by a strict interpretation of the Enabling Act's residency requirements as follows:\n\n\"Two commissioners shall be residents of New Smyrna Beach, two commissioners shall be residents of the City of Edgewater, one commissioner shall be a resident of Oak Hill, and two commissioners shall be residents of the unincorporated area of the hospital district.\"\n\nI believe the residency requirement was designed to give residents of the three cities and unincorporated area of the hospital district a more direct voice through your appointees to the Hospital District. \n\nWhile I currently reside in New Smyrna Beach, my medical office is located in Edgewater. This gives me the unique opportunity to discuss health care issues and the hospital personally with hundreds of Edgewater residents a month. While I also have a home under construction in Edgewater, my ability to represent, for you, the citizens of Edgewater would not be enhanced by moving.\n\nThe Act also states:\n\n\"Commissioners shall have business, professional, or personal experience useful for service as a commissioner.\"\n\nI believe being a female doctor practicing in Edgewater, admitting patients to Bert Fish Hospital, being a former employee of the Hospital and talking daily about health care issues with residents of Edgewater, provides that \"personal experience useful for service as a commissioner.\"\n\nFinally, if you believe I am otherwise the best qualified candidate to serve as your Edgewater commissioner, you may be able to \"liberally construe\" the Act if you believe my professional service to Edgewater citizens would allow me to \"accomplish the work authorized\" as follows:\n\n\"Section 20. It is intended that the provisions of this act shall be liberally construed for accomplishing the work authorized and provided for or intended to be and provided for this act.\"\n\nGovernor, I believe I am uniquely qualified to \"accomplish the work authorized\" for the citizens of Edgewater as your commissioner on the hospital district board.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nDr Susan Hole Ltc USAR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The idea that after adopting seven special needs children\nof which most are disabled that I would be forced to go back to work and\njeopardize the day to day special care of the children simply because\nthe state chooses to butt heads with Federal laws allowing support for\nspecial needs adoptions is ludicrous and unjust to strengthen families\nattitudes.\nJust my opinion.\nMary\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2003 12:19 a.m. EST\nCOMMENTARY\nStronger Families  By JEB BUSH\n\nTALLAHASSEE -- Every year in this state, 80,000 children are born\nwithout a\nfather in the home. Each year, there are 85,000 abortions, and 80,000\nFlorida marriages are dissolved. Today, almost 50,000 Florida children\nare\nunder some kind of state supervision. Hundreds of thousands are not\nreceiving the child support they deserve.\n\nAcross the country, the numbers are so staggering, and the implications\nso\nbleak, that we can become numb to the human toll they exact. Adding one\nmore\nsocial worker, one more government program, will never reverse the\ntrends\nand convince people to care for each other. We must start first in our\nown\nhomes.\n\nThe challenge for policymakers is how to help that happen. In Florida,\nwe\nhave identified three broad goals for the years ahead: reading,\ndiversifying\nour economy, and strengthening families. We have linked the first two\ngoals\nclosely with the third.\n\nIn reading, our efforts will build on the public school accountability\nreforms we've implemented that are already reflected in rising student\nachievement. They will also reinforce the role of parents and families\nin\nnurturing a love of reading in our children, through adult literacy\nprograms\nand helping parents support the instruction their kids are receiving at\nschool.\n\nWe're committed to the low-tax, business-friendly policies that have\nbeen\nthe catalysts for the job growth in Florida. But that's more than just\ngood\nbusiness. Better jobs and higher wages will allow parents to better\nprovide\nfor their children and spend more time with them.\n\nThe fiscal challenges are very real. But this optimistic view of\nstronger\nfamilies is also the most realistic view. Americans have always been\nthat\nway, and that's who we must be today.\n\nMr. Bush is the governor of Florida.\n\n\n"

The plan\ncomplies with the class size reduction amendment that passed with a 52\npercent majority in the 2002 election.  The proposal contains a number of\nelements that provide each district the greatest possible flexibility,\nequity and accountability.   Charter schools are a major component to\nimplementing the amendment.  As schools of choice, charters themselves are\nnot subject to class size reduction, but the proposal calls for an\nelimination of the cap on the number of charter schools allowed in each\ndistrict.  This will give more children the ability to leave crowded public\nschools and attend charters.  It's a win-win for everyone. \n\nPennsylvania: Last week the Pennsylvania state department of education\nrejected five of five cyber charter school applications.  Under new\nprovisions. cyber school proposals can only be approved by the state.\nResubmission to the department or appealing to the Charter School Appeals\nBoard is still an option for those applications that were denied.  As this\nis the first round of charter school applications to come before\nPennsylvania's new leadership. these rejections are a likely indication of\nits mindset towards the charter school movement.\n\nMassachusetts:  Local governments and schools in the Bay state are targeting\ncharters to soften the budget cuts that are inevitable across the board.  A\nWaltham elementary school principal \"sent an email to families urging defeat\nof a charter program.  In Framingham, homeowners got a letter with their tax\nbill reminding them of the fiscal impact of a charter school that opened\nlast fall.  In North Adams and surrounding towns, some 400 people have\nsigned a petition against a charter school proposal,\" according to the\nBoston Globe.\n\n\n"

Brewser Brown, from the Governor's \noffice was on that call when we discussed the identification of interested \ndistricts to participate in a Pilot Study. A few of the districts that had \nmembers serving on the Blue Ribbon Task Force were initially contacted to \nsolicit their interest and participation.  Escambia and Pinellas were two \nthat immediately expressed an interest to participate.  \n\nI have also researched the \"Florida Study of Educational Technology 2002\" and \nhave highlighted the sections that most pertain to projects that have been \nconducted in these districts for their further consideration as Pilot Sites.\n\nOn pages 14 & 15 of that report, regarding projects conducted:\n\nStudent's mastery of standards and benchmarks are assessed using computers \nand that assessment provides teachers with immediate feedback on students' \nneeds, enabling problems to be caught and solved at an early stage. (Broward) \n \n\nWireless labs along with other technologies are being used as tools and \nintegrated into all curriculum aspects of instruction. (Pinellas)   \n\nEach of the district's 5 schools is equipped with mobile labs, consisting of \nlaptops on carts and wireless connectivity devices, network printers, \nprojectors, digital cameras, network switches and powerstrips. (Baker) \n\nAllowing students to check out wireless laptop computers for use in the \nclassroom and at home...this allows the students to access the server \ncontaining their work and allowing them to access software and the Internet.  \nThis project is set up to determine the effectiveness of laptop portability, \nwireless connectivity and parent involvement. (Gilchrist) \n\n1:1 computer instruction available to students on a 24/7 time frame in a \nwireless environment. (Jefferson)   \n\nEach laptop has wireless connectivity to the Internet and the district \nIntranet. (St. Lucie) \n\nStudents can access Internet content and services from anywhere in the school \nusing a mobile lab.  Students use this for research, word processing, \ncreating web content, and monitoring their own academic progress. (St. Johns)\n\nThese are just a few of the districts and projects represented in the study.\n\n On page 12 of the  Study it is requested that there be \"computer-based \ninstruction to aid special education students...\"and on page 13...\"School \ndistricts recognize that various technologies are tools to accomplish \nlearning tasks. ...and software to align exceptional student classroom \ninstruction with regular education curriculum and FCAT.\" \n\nI'm hoping that this will be helpful, and certainly you can count on Michael \n& I to aid with any presentations to these and other districts to promote \ntheir participation in a Pilot Project.\n\nThe entire study can be viewed at \nhttp://www.doe.firn.edu/edtech/sr/fset/downloads/FSETReport.pdf\n\nI'm really looking forward to attending one of the Regional Meetings next \nweek in Tampa.  Hope to see you there!\n\nKaren\n"

Did\nthese people expect someone else to pay for what they voted for? This is\na good example of the adage \"A liberal is someone who'd give you the\nshirt off someone else's back.\"\n\n\nWhat we have here, I believe, is nothing but more liberal whining.

I have been a full time viable resident of Florida for 18 years and have never sought any public assistance.  As of December 1st, I had no alternative than to file for Unemployment and have been actively pursuing a career in the Lee County Government or the State of Florida to provide the insurance benefits my family needs.\n \nI have made application recently with the Florida Kidcare and Florida Healthy Kid program as I can no longer afford $453.00 per month for insurance coverage for my 2 girls.  I contacted the Kidcare program this morning only to find that they have not processed my application, however I was informed that because I have insurance in place at the time of application I would not qualify.  I informed them that I have to cancel the insurance at the end of this month rather than the end of March as indicated on the application.   I cannot be 6-8 weeks without any insurance to find out if I qualify or not.  Nor can I  keep my existing insurance if my family would like to eat!\n \nI have exhausted my savings prior to filing for Unemployment as I was \"too proud\" to do so and with the bills piling up rapidly I had no other choice.  \n \nI will continue to seek employment with the State of Florida, Lee County Government and larger civilian sector companies so that I will have the benefits that should be afforded to all Americans.\n \nI now ask for intervention from you and/or your staff so that I may have my insurance for my children during this transition period.\n \nYour consideration concerning this matter is greatly appreciated.\n \nRespectfully,\nCatherine C.

The President has been running into rough sledding over the last several weeks. The coalition that at one point had seemed so promising with France, Germany and Russia on our side has come apart. Chancellor Schroeder recently stated that Germany will not send troops and will not vote for a resolution for war. The President of France joined Germany in opposing war and has called for more inspections over a long period of time. The U.S. had asked for backup support from NATO and even this has been turned down. The new Turkish government has been ambivalent. The first indications were that we were going to be able to post massive troops along the Turkish-Iraqi border. The Turkish government backed off and indicated that only talks with the military about posting troops were going to be held and that no definitive decision had been made. Several months ago, I was in England and talked with some of the Labor Party members of Parliament about what England would do if there were no UN resolution or definitive proof of weapons of mass destruction. The members indicated that Prime Minister Tony Blair was out ahead of his party and support for the U.S. position was slipping.\n\nThis President is not one who lives or dies by polls, but he also has a great deal of common sense. Most people in this country do not like Saddam Hussein, his repressive regime or what he has done with chemical or biological weapons in the past. That is not the issue. Many people in the United States feel that even if he has such weapons, he isn't dumb enough to try and use them, as Iraq would be nothing but a desert. Furthermore, a great many Americans are looking for the smoking gun. The inspectors have not turned anything up so far and it appears that they will not in the near future. Saddam has had years to hide these weapons and the inspectors are doing nothing more than playing a game of \"Hide n' Seek\". Most Americans hoped that the President, as was done years ago at the United Nations during the Cuba missile crisis, would have shown a satellite photo or come up with definitive evidence that leaves no doubt about Saddam's evil intent. That did not happen in the State of the Union address. There are many good reasons why, if we have the intelligence, we are not able to use it. The biggest reason is not revealing our sources. But it's not good enough to just say, \"we know\". It's not good enough for the people in the United States, and its not good enough for our friends and potential allies abroad.\n\nI am sure the President and his advisors are deeply frustrated. It appeared for a while that Saddam was on the run with countries in the Arab world looking for ways to get him out of Iraq. The pressure was building on Saddam and undoubtedly some serious thought was being given within Iraq to his leaving. However, it appears he has dodged another bullet and the pressure that was on him has dissipated as quickly as a gas balloon that is punctured. If this is a chess match, Saddam is several moves ahead of the United States and the pressure has now shifted to the United States to make a case or go it alone.\n\nLet me admit that I am personally biased. I have great faith in the President's judgment and I have known some of the people who are involved in the process for over thirty years, especially the Vice President and the Secretary of Defense. These are bright, intelligent, honest, hard-nosed, common sense people. They are not bomb-throwers. They are not alarmists. They deeply feel there is a threat to our nation and that Saddam is just playing games. They don't want to take military action, but may be forced to take it if there is no other choice. I have no inside knowledge but believe there is confidential information that, if we all had, would cause us to back the President. Secretary Powell is going to present our case to the UN on February 5th. I hope this will \"make the case\" and unite the country. We don't want another Vietnam.\n\n\n\n <http://www.enewsbuilder.net/eletra/mod_print_view.cfm?this_id=123393&u=freylddkr&issue_id=[REDACTED]> [PRINTER FRIENDLY VERSION] \n\nAbout Congressman Lou Frey, Jr. \n\n\n\nLou Frey represented Central Florida in the U.

Some states , Virginia and Georgia for example, have recently built very large new facilities with updated equipment for researchers.  The County of Knox, TN is building a large new History Center.\n \nAs it was, I was appalled at the under staffed,small cramped quarters that the State of Florida had provided for researchers and it was clear that this was already a low priority for the State. But to think that it would recieve even less attention was something I had not  imagined.  Florida is a very important State in the history of our nation, and has a very colorful and rich history which needs to be shared and made easily available to those who wish to work with the records and collections.  This idea is one which in the short run may save come costs, but in the long run would be a tragedy.

        "body": "\n\nSir,\n\nI understand you have assigned someone to look into the matter involving the Nihipali children, in Fort Myers, Fl. The children are currently in DCF custody at a foster home, but may soon be sent to the biological father in Hawaii, as per a court order by Judge Isaac Anderson.  I am the great aunt to the children on the maternal side, and was the family placement for the children from September 2001 until December 2002.  The entire time I had the babies it was the assumption of all parties, (including DCF and the Guardian Ad Litem), that the father would not be an issue when it came time to place the children in a stable home environment. This assumption of all parties was because of the father's criminal history, pattern of abusive behavior toward family members, drug and alcohol abuse, lack of continued employment, he doesn't read or write, he's on welfare, and testimony of a 14 yr old stepdaughter, who stated she and her other sister were given drugs and alcohol by the father while in the home with him. (At the time they were 11 and 12 yrs old)! After hearing that statement in October, the Judge stated he would not place the children in such an environment, yet in January he ruled the children should be with the father. (I firmly believe the Judge did not remember and associate the 14yr old he'd  talked to in October to the case in January. (The children have different last names than their older sister). Since the October hearing the only change is that the children have been moved to a VERY LOVING long term home, and Mr. Nihipali has tested positive for THC on both UAs he's been given. I am devastated at what is happening here with these children. Mr Nihipali has been arrested 22 times, and has been the suspect in more cases. His daughter was taken from the home in 1997 due to drugs and alcohol. Yet Hawaii DCF say be completed a \"drug class\" so he is okay now. I beg to differ. He supplied drugs to young kids in 2000 and 2001, and is still testing positive.  Mr Nihipali is obviously scamming the system in Hawaii, (as he has done before).  My question is WHY does Florida have to accept such a home study. Don't we have higher standards than that?  The 2 14yr olds are now extremely disturbed children. One only reads at a 3rd or 4th grade level and has lots of problems in school, and the other one is a 14yr old drug addict who is currently in the custody of DJJ. (This really makes me sick because she was always an A student in all honors classes, and has so much potential). I know all of the facts about this case, and would be glad to answer and questions. There are so many people that are \"up in arms\" about this situation. We just don't know what else to do. NO ONE thinks these children should be placed in that environment, yet it appears time is slipping away and nothing is getting done about it.  I will be happy to answer any questions or concerns. My home number is (239) 283-7663, and my work number is (239) 477-1217. PLEASE HELP!!!!  Thank you for your time, and keep up the good work!!     \n\nP.S. Kim and Kenny Dobson, the current foster parents, are great. The kids love them and the love is returned. They are so happy. I've know the Dobson's since they were teenagers. I would never have turned the children over to anyone else. Even so, we took several months to transition the children, so the final move was not at all traumatic for them. We love those children and have always kept their best interest in the forefront!!.    \n\n          \nDena Macomber\nCommunications Division Director\n(239) 477-1217\n\n"

Mike Fasano, an outspoken critic of higher taxes, lost his vice chairmanship Wednesday on a Senate committee that has the power to pass tax bills. \n\nFasano, R-New Port Richey, was dropped from the Senate Finance & Tax Committee. \n\nA conservative ally of House Speaker Johnnie Byrd, R-Plant City, Fasano said Senate President Jim King called him on his cell phone and attributed the change to \"my comments and my actions opposed to increased taxes.\" \n\nKing's spokeswoman, Sarah Bascom, confirmed Fasano is no longer on the committee, but said she did not know why. She said the recent death of Sen. Howard Futch required the shifting of senators to other committees to preserve a partisan balance of Republicans and Democrats. \n\n\"He could have made up an excuse but he didn't. He made it clear to me,\" Fasano said. \n\nFasano, a former House member, was the only House Republican who voted last year to oppose a compromise between then-Senate President John McKay and then-House Speaker Tom Feeney to form a committee to study sales tax exemptions. The committee, a face-saving step, was subsequently struck down by the state Supreme Court. \n\nFasano said he thought the catalyst for King's decision probably was tied to Fasano's comments during the Finance and Tax Committee's workshop on Jan. 16, when a list of revenue options, which Byrd has called the \"Senate tax plan,\" was first circulated. Fasano said committee Chairman Skip Campbell asked if anyone had anything to add. \n\n\"I raised my hand and asked if we could take items off the list,\" Fasano said. \n\n-- Times staff writer Alisa Ulferts contributed to this report. \n\n"

        "body": "\n\"You would think that if you lead the nation on a case-by-case basis of death row commutations, it might be just a bit of a tip to the political intelligentsia that something is rotten.\"  Daniel Ruth\nCOMMENT: The key word here is \"intelligentsia.\"   Need I say more!  How do you sleep at night?\n=============================================================\nFlorida Strives To Regain The Title In Death Row Follies\nDANIEL RUTH \nPublished: Jan 29, 2003 \n\nTypical, typical, typical that an Illinois politician would cheat so flagrantly to become No. 1 at something. \nWhen Gov. George Ryan commuted the sentences of all 167 Illinois death row inmates in his waning hours in office, obviously his state vaulted way past Florida as the most screwed-up capital punishment place in the country. \nThat was so unfair. Especially considering Florida had achieved its prior status as the national leader in death row commutations the old- fashioned way - by botching one case at a time. \nWithout the benefit of a blanket clemency granted by a departing governor, Florida has released 25 formerly condemned men after discovering evidence that questioned their guilt. \nLast week Rudolph Holton was released from Union Correctional Institution, where he had spent 16 years on death row for a murder conviction won because of dubious witnesses and police incompetence. \nSixteen years in a cage. \nWe May Never Know \nHow close did Florida come to executing a man even his former prosecutor, Joe Episcopo, now believes is innocent? We may never know. \nHolton was exonerated largely on evidence that didn't exist at his original trial in 1986. Hair found in the murder victim's mouth, purported to be Holton's, was proved to be that of the 17-year-old victim, Katrina Ann Graddy. \nYou would think that if you lead the nation on a case-by-case basis of death row commutations, it might be just a bit of a tip to the political intelligentsia that something is rotten. \nWho could possibly blame Gov. Jeb Bush, an ardent pro-life pol, if he ordered a moratorium on future executions until the state is sure it is killing the right people? \nIf ever there was a ``duh'' moment, this would have to be it. \nYet Bush has proposed eliminating state money for lawyers representing death row inmates, arguing that taxpayers would save $4 million a year. \nTalk about being penny-wise and body bag foolish! \nInstead of doing everything possible to ensure that if the state is going to kill somebody, it might be sort of a neat idea if the person actually deserves to die, Bush has decided to save a few bucks by undermining the ability of a prisoner to petition the courts. \nThink of it this way: Florida's $4 million in funding for capital punishment cases applies to 365 condemned inmates, pretty much a bargain-basement figure to start. By contrast, Jeb Bush blew $1 million just to celebrate his second inauguration. Yes, he spent private money in that case, but the comparison remains. \nAbe Bonowitz, who leads Floridians For Alternatives to the Death Penalty, argues that eliminating funding for death row legal representation probably would lead to increased costs down the road and a higher probability of executing innocent people. \n``Maybe one of these days somebody will hit Governor Bush up aside the head,'' Bonowitz said, noting that Ryan, once a fervent death penalty proponent, changed his views after signing a death warrant for a prisoner later proven innocent. \nAt the moment, Bonowitz estimated, Florida has at least 10 of 365 death row cases in which there are ``serious questions of guilt, and there may be more.'' \nAssuming Bonowitz may be on to something, wouldn't that make the case for a moratorium on executions until the state can figure out a way to ensure it is killing, you know, guilty people? \nInstead, Bush wants to speed the appeals process - but without funding legal representation for the condemned. \nNo Technicalities \n``The bottom line is there hasn't been anyone found innocent on death row,'' blathered state Sen. Victor Crist, R-Last Rites. ``There have been people released on [legal] technicalities.'' \nHolton wasn't released from death row on a ``technicality.'' New evidence exonerated him, along with the admission by witnesses that they lied. \nFrank Lee Smith was another man cleared of a murder charge after DNA evidence proved his innocence. But Smith wasn't released from prison because of some legal mumbo-jumbo, either. No sir. \nAfter 14 years waiting for a governor to kill him, Smith died in his cell. \nDoes cancer qualify as flouting justice with a ``legal technicality''? \nColumnist Daniel Ruth can be reached at (813) 259-7599.\n\n"

Why is it wrong to use a taxpayer supported educational institution to\n> promote a particular faith but yet perfectly acceptable for that same\n> taxpayer supported educational institution to use course materials' whose\n> authors question and even mock the tenets of that faith.\n>\n> Courts in America have ruled that we can't pray at football games and\n> graduation, that the words \"Under God\" are illegal in the Pledge of\n> Allegiance, and that the Ten Commandments can not be posted in schools.\n> But apparently we CAN use taxpayer supported funds to teach a course\n> entitled  \"The Fictional Jesus\", focusing on 'literary' works which\ndirectly\n> oppose and even mock specific religious beliefs, all in the name of\nacademic\n> freedom, intellectual debate, etc.\n>\n> Can one imagine if a state-supported institution had a course whose\nsyllabus\n> included literary and film works mocking and/or attacking or even\n> questioning the Jewish faith or the Muslim faith? I would imagine every\n> academic liberal in this country would be in an uproar crying 'foul'.\n>\n>\n>\n> 2.

His common sense leadership approach to education,\neschewing the political correctness mantras now endemic in higher\neducation, is direly needed on the University scene in this state.\nHowever, he will be sorely missed as your heir apparent to become\nGovernor in four years; a concern we all share.\n\nOne person whom I believe will meet this need of electability and serve\nyou well during the remainder of your term is Jennifer Carroll. My\nenquiries indicate that in addition to being articulate, charismatic,\npoised, and a lovely lady, she has demonstrated political and leadership\nabilities that reflected exceptionally well on her in her recent bid for\nCongress against an entrenched leftist. She demonstrated under fire that\nher political philosophy is clearly to the right of center and well\nwithin the conservative mainstream in Florida.\nSeldom has a nominee losing a general election in a high profile race\nremained in such high esteem, and this certainly bodes well for her\npolitical future.The fact that she has served in the Navy as a Lt.\nCommander, I submit, is also a plus.\n\nJennifer, appointed as your Lt. Governor, can be considered essentially\nin two ways: A bold move by you in appointing a conservative,\ncharismatic, poised,black and electable woman to be groomed to succeed\nyou and carry on your conservatively oriented reforms, or as a move to\npander to feminists and blacks. I submit that the overwhelming response\nwill be that you are grooming a worthy successor once she receives\nstatewide exposure. I sincerely hope you will seriously consider\nJennifer Carroll to be a worthy successor to Frank Brogan when he is\nappointed to head FAU tomorrow.\n\nC.

        "subject": "Military Pay Raise!?!",
        "body": "\nI agree that this Airman should get a medal. Dave.\n\n\n Subject: Military Pay Raise \n \n On 12 Nov, Ms Cindy Williams (from Laverne and Shirley TV show) wrote a\npiece for the Washington Times, denouncing the pay raise(s) coming\nservicemembers' way this year -- citing that the stated 13% wage was more\nthan they deserve. A young airman from Hill AFB responds to her article\nbelow. He ought to  get a bonus for this! \n\n\"Ms Williams: \n \n I just had the pleasure of reading your column, \"Our GIs earn enough\" and\nI am a bit confused. Frankly, I'm wondering where this vaunted overpayment\nis going, because as far as I can tell, it disappears every month between\nDFAS (The Defense Finance and Accounting Service) and my bank account.\nChecking  my latest leave and earnings statement (LES), I see that I make\n$1,117.80 before taxes. After taxes, I take home $874.20. When I run that\nthrough Windows' Calculator, I come up with an annual salary of $13,413.60\nbefore  taxes, and $10,490.40 after. \n I work in the Air Force Network Control Center (AFNCC), where I am part of\n the team responsible for the administration of a 5,000-host computer \nnetwork. I am involved with infrastructure segments, specifically with\nCisco Systems equipment. A quick check under jobs for Network Technicians\nin the Washington, D.C. area reveals a position in my career field, \nrequiring three years experience with my job. Amazingly, this job does NOT\npay $13,413.60 a year, nor does it pay less than this. No, this job is\nbeing offered at $70,000 to $80,000 per annum. I'm sure you can draw the\nobvious conclusions. \n Also, you tout increases to Basic Allowance for Housing and Basic\nAllowance for Subsistence (housing and food allowances, respectively) as\nbeing a further boon to an already overcompensated force. Again, I'm\ncurious as to \n where this money has gone, as BAH and BAS were both slashed \n15% in the Hill AFB area effective in January 00. \n Given the tenor of your column, I would assume that you have NEVER had the \npleasure of serving your country in her armed forces. Before you take it\nupon yourself to once more castigate congressional and DOD leadership for \nattempting to get the families in the military's lowest pay brackets off\nAFDC, WIC, and food stamps, I suggest that you join a group of deploying\nsoldiers headed for AFGHANISTAN, I leave the choice of service branch up to\nyou. Whatever choice you make, though, opt for the SIX month rotation: it\nwill guarantee you the longest possible time away from your family and\nfriends, thus giving you full \"deployment experience.\"  As your group\nprepares to board the plane, make sure to note the spouses  and children\nwho are saying good-bye to their loved ones. Also take care to note that\nseveral families are still unsure of how they'll be able to make \n ends meet while the primary breadwinner is gone -- obviously they've been\nsquandering the vast piles of cash the DOD has been giving them. \n Try to deploy over a major holiday; Christmas and Thanksgiving are\nperennial favorites. And when you're actually over there, sitting in a DFP\n(Defensive Fire \n Position, the modern-day foxhole), shivering against the cold desert\nnight; and the flight sergeant tells you that there aren't enough people on\nshift to relieve you for chow, remember this: trade whatever MRE\n(meal-ready-to-eat) you manage to get for the tuna noodle casserole or\ncheese tortellini, and add Tabasco to everything. This gives some flavor. \n Talk to your loved ones as often as you are permitted; it won't nearly be\nlong enough or often enough, but take what you can get and be thankful for\nit. You may have picked up on the fact that I disagree with most of the\npoints you present in your op-ed piece. \n But, tomorrow from KABUL, I will defend to the death your right to say it.\n You see, I am an American fighting man, a guarantor of your First\nAmendment rights and every other right you cherish. On a daily basis, my\nbrother and sister soldiers worldwide ensure that you and people like you\ncan thumb your collective nose at us, all on a salary that is nothing short\nof pitiful and under conditions that would make most people cringe. \n We hemorrhage our best and brightest into the private sector because we\ncan't offer the stability and pay of civilian companies. And you, Ms\nWilliams, have the gall to say that we make more than we deserve? Rubbish! \n \nA1C Michael Bragg, Hill AFB AFNCC\" \n\n IF YOU AGREE, PLEASE PASS THIS ALONG TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE AND\nSHOW OUR SUPPORT OF THE AMERICAN FIGHTING MEN AND WOMEN. THANK YOU. \n THIS LETTER SHOULD BE APPLAUDED BY ANYONE WHO'S EVER SERVED OR HAD A\nFAMILY MEMBER SERVE IN THE ARMED FORCES! THIS YOUNG MAN DESERVES A MEDAL! \n\n\nAS FOR ME ;; BEEN THERE DONE THAT AND FOR A CHANGE HE IS RIGHT AND SHE IS W\nR O N G !!!!!!! \n\n\n"

In addition to being an Osceola School Board member I am also Vice Chairman of the Osceola Boys and Girls Clubs Board of Directors. In the past two years we have started two new programs at Middle Schools at one School the first year of operation proved to be the first time in 8 yrs that School had NO pregnancies. Books are great, but money is what we really need. We can get a program serving 100 kids daily up for just under 80K for the School yr and about 110K yr round. We target Schools with over 50% of the students on free and reduced lunches, that allows us to give the kids a snack too at NC-we piggyback on the USDA grant already in place for the meals. We are planning a summer dinner fund raiser. If you would be willing to be the featured speaker at an event it would be a great hook for fund raising. Is there a Friday or Saturday night this summer that you could make yourself available to join us so we can raise badly needed funds for our kids ? Kind Regards, Jay Wheeler/Osceola County School Board-District One    \n\n"

        "subject": "Talking Points",
        "body": "Cc: Dana, Pam; Jesse Manzano; David Bishop; Simon, Hugh; Patrick Archer; Mark Busse; Mike Pilver; Ines Calderon Florida FTAA\n\n\nI know your colleagues are working feverishly to prepare talking points for you for tomorrow\u2019s 3:30 p.m. press conference, drafting a press release and preparing comments for your 5 p.m. AACCLA speech.  Although I\u2019ve talked to several of your colleagues about the press conference and the speech, I have not yet had a chance to see the final approvals.  I thought it might be helpful to you and your colleagues if I could put my suggested talking points for you for the press conference in writing.  They are as follows:\n \n1.\tAs the Governor, I am delighted that Mayor Penelas, Mayor Diaz, Mayor Slesnick, Mayor Dermer, Commissioner Diaz and Commissioner Winton have (i) been working in a very cooperative and efficient manner with my designee Chuck Cobb to create a Memorandum of Understanding for hosting the Ministerial / Americas Business Forum (ABF), (ii) have selected a prominent Board of Directors for this task, (iii) have selected my long-time colleague Armando Codina to be the President of the ABF and (iv) have selected Luis Lauredo to be the Executive Director of the Ministerial and ABF.  You have accomplished a lot in a short time, and I am very appreciative of your efforts. \n\n2.\tAs the Governor, I am pleased to announce this prestigious Board consisting of all of South Florida\u2019s former U.S. Ambassadors, most of South Florida\u2019s leading international business executives, several of South Florida\u2019s top university and college presidents and other leading internationalists in this community.  I am very pleased that the mayors and commissioners have agreed on such a prestigious Board.  Good job. \n\n3.\tAs the Governor, I am confident this Board, with the active involvement of the mayors, commissioners, Chuck Cobb, Armando Codina, Luis Lauredo and other community leaders, and the assistance of the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau, Beacon Council, Enterprise Florida and other organization and community leaders, is going to successfully host this Ministerial and ABF just like it has done many times in the past in hosting super bowls, national Republican and Democratic Conventions and various international conferences. \n\n4.\tAs Governor, I am pleased to announce the dates for the FTAA Trade Ministerial and ABF.  The meeting of trade ministers will be held on November 20-21 and the ABF will take place during the week of Monday, November 17, overlapping with the Ministerial.  The decision on the dates for the Miami meeting was made by the United States Trade Representative in Washington D.C. and coordinated with the government of Brazil, which co-chairs the FTAA negotiations with the U.S. \n\n5.\tAs Governor, I am going to be recommending a modest contribution of state funds for hosting the Ministerial and ABF during the next very tight budget year, as I am looking to the local communities to fund a high percentage of this important event just like Miami normally does in the type of events mentioned above. \n\n6.\tAs Governor, I plan to be actively involved to bring the FTAA Secretariat to Miami.  As I have stated previously, diversifying Florida\u2019s economy is one of my three highest priorities for the next four years and obtaining the Secretariat for Florida and Miami in order that it can be the Brussels of the Western Hemisphere is precisely the type of economic diversification for which I am hopeful.  As I also stated before, I plan to spend a high percentage of my time during the next four years in South Florida in order that I will have sufficient time for this and other South Florida initiatives. \n\n7.\tAs Governor, one of my highest priorities will be to convince federal officials in the Administration and Congress that the U.S. should have one candidate for Secretariat of the FTAA in a fashion similar to how the U.S. selects one candidate to host the Olympic games or other international events.  Our country has learned long ago in Olympic games and other site selection processes, that we are only effective if we \u201chave one horse in the race.\u201d \n \nI am confident your colleagues will have most of the above points in your approved talking points, but I thought it might be productive for me to reemphasize these points to you.  All of the above seven points are important, but I think #7 above (the U.S. \u201chaving one horse in the race\u201d) is the most critical of all.\n \nThank you again for making this effort such a high priority.  I hope I have a chance to see you for a few minutes before the 3:30 p.m. press conference.\n"

        "body": "\nDear Governor Bush:\n\nI met today with a group of mothers that have young adults sons in adult prison.  Our first topic of conversation was the disparity of sentencing lengths from one case to another, especially of first time offenders that were under the age of 21 being sentenced adult. The same offense could get probation or 20 years.  So much depended on the judge, or the legal system, not the offense.  The fairness of \"equality under the law\" is missing.\n\nThe stories of problems of medical neglect (one mother has a son that was in the same room as the inmate that was a Butler CI, that had complained of agonizing pain for three days which was left untreated and died).  We all have stories of harassment by cocky officers, that took it upon themselves to set up inmates with DRs, from planting marijuana under the bed to my son who was set up on first an assault charge and them and a weapons charge. We all have stories of sons or inmates being beaten and physically abused.  Some stories were about inmates being raped, or inflicting physical injury on other inmates, and some of officers and guards beating or inflicting injury on inmates.  We all agreed that there is no due process rights for the incarcerated.  We all agreed that the grievance process is an empty sham.  We all knew the end story of a grievance being written, and rubber stamped denied, without any real review.  The problems of each institution being ran with so much autonomy, that no one is regulating them, was lamented as state responsibility being shirked.  This was allowing extremities of treatment of inmates.\n\nWe told of the heartache of having first time DUI offenders doing heavier sentences than violent offenders that set out to do a crime.  \n\nWe talked about the lack of available educational and vocational programs.  One of the sons has had no availability of the GED programs.  He went in at 19 and is now 25.  His DUI ended the lives of two persons and has left him crippled for life. He lives in pain.  The DOC doctors will not prescribe the medication that is most effective, because it is not on the list.  The pain has not allowed him to go to school, that and the lack of assistive technology. \n\nWe fear for our sons to return to society, not because they are bad people but because their lives have been thwarted by the policies of being dehumanized and of punishment, with no rehabilitation opportunities and no job skill options.  The adjustment from having ten or more years of their lives wasted. The adjustment to society will be very difficult because of the hostile, oppressive conditions that they have been subjected.  They sometimes have been subjected to inhumane treatment, that would be illegal if applied to animals.\n\nWe shared the problems of having to support the exorbitant phone call rate.  The institution has a significant shortage of supplies, of everything from toilet paper to clothing.  \n\nIn a DOC hospital setting, one mother had the unusual privilege of getting to eat an inmate's tray of food.  She indicated the she would have liked for you to have tried to have eaten it.  We all felt that we are having to subsidize the food rationing with money from home to go to the canteen.  We felt that if we were going to have to provide food for them, that we should not have to be scalped by the outrageous prices that are being charged.  \n\nAs a group we feel that we are being punished for our sons accidents by the manner that we are treated by the Institutions. If we show concern for C. I's wrong doings they harass, pressure, and penalize our sons.  In our case they have taken our visitation rights away, in retaliation of our allegations of their corruption of setting our son up with a weapons charge. \n\nWe feel that there is no person in Tallahassee that has given us any help with questions about regulations, or to talk to about the corruption that we have encountered in different institutions.  The Prison liaison acts like a buffer for the prison system, she is equivalent to being sent to a dead letter file.  We have no liaison to act in our inmates interest. \n\nWe will meet again, and next time we will have more information and meet with more parents and friends, and we will unite with other organizations that want reform.  We will start to talk to representatives about the need for changes.  We will tell the citizens in Florida the truth about the expensive failure of our prison system policies. \n\nOur children's lives are being damaged.  We have to do something. \nGovernor Bush, you need to do something.\n\nMarlene Nolte-\n4907 Coral Blvd.\nBradenton, FL 34210\n(941) 794-0197\n\n"

He knows all the history and all the players of State government.   He has an excellent legal mind and he can be very creative in coming up with solutions that will work and be acceptable.   He was invaluable to Ileana when we faced Magda Montial Davis by doing some excellent research work to help us see who was opposing us.    Which leads me to his loyalty.   Peter is the most loyal, discreet patriotic American I know.   When I tell him not to repeat something, I do not have to worry about it.   He will not repeat it ever.   Additionally, when a decision is made after a lot of back and forth over an issue, Peter is a team player and he will move forward with the decision.  No trouble, low maintenance.....     He is the greatest!   Below is his resume.   I hope you will be able to consider him for a suitable position in your administration.

Unfortunately, the caseworker (Susan Klatt) didn't find anything to support the fact that Marisa's father (Kenneth Salyers) has mishandled her and has shaken her.  I want you to know that Susan let me know how much she put into this investigation and how they usually don't do that.  Please know that I am grateful that she did.  Also know that Susan presented her findings in court very well (being her first time in court).  So again, thank you.\n \nOf course, I realize that without witnesses there isn't much anyone can do.  And from what I've read about child abuse and shaken baby syndrome there usually isn't a previous history of abuse for those who just \"lost it\" when the baby was crying.  Here's the point Sir, I SAW him shake her, and I SAW him squeeze her chest several times (only when she was crying).  I cannot be told that it didn't happen and I cannot feel safe leaving Marisa in his care without supervision.\n \nOn December 9, 2002, I had filed a petition for a temporary injunction, we had the hearing on January 24, 2003 and with the limited time allowed and lack of proof, the judge dismissed the injunction.  There is no way that I can come to peace with having to hand Marisa over to Kenneth unsupervised.  Kenneth sat in court and lied about the events of the day (November 24, 2002) when he shook Marisa.  How do I, as a mother, accept the fact that he took an oath to tell the truth and lied AND has shaken Marisa to be dismissed?  And how do I accept that this is the type of father Kenneth will be to our daughter?  What can I do?  Dianne Johnson (at DCF) told me that if Marisa came home hurt or with signs of abuse  - now I would know what to do.  I am asking you HOW DO I ACCEPT THAT?  Are you a father?  Would you just let someone get away with treating your child that way?  If you knew the truth and you were denied protection would you stop at nothing to ensure your child's safety?\n \nI understand that Kenneth is Marisa's biological father, even though he wanted an abortion in January 2002, and now I can anticipate him fighting for custody of her.  I can't deny him visitation, this I know, but how do I get supervised visitation for my daughter - let someone else see what he is like with her (and it's going to take more than one visit I'm sure).  Ken's attorney won't accept supervised visits and I won't accept having to wait until Marisa is hurt for something to be done.  My attorney said that Ken knows people are watching him now that we've been through this and he won't mess up again.  But I tell you, I know Ken, I have witnessed his behavior and have seen his pattern.  Yes, maybe he will not hurt her right now, but it is only a matter of time.  Mark my words, 4 months is the longest I've ever seen him behave without some form of abuse.\n \nThe detective that was on the case told me I shouldn't be afraid of him.  WHY NOT?  He has told me that \"looking back at my divorce, I would have rather gone to jail for shooting my ex-wife than give her my house\".  And he has told me that he has people who owe him \"favors\" still.   -  And have witnessed his behavior.  You tell me Sir, why would the detective tell me I shouldn't be scared of Ken?  What is protecting me?  What is protecting my daughter?  NOTHING I tell you, nothing.  I went to court and told the truth, Ken went to court and lied - and who won?  Ken.  How does that happen?  I tell you, if you now tell me that I should have faith in our justice system I will have to tell you that from my experience our justice system protects the guilty - so long as you have a good attorney.\n \nIs there an appeal that can be filed?  Is there a way to get supervised visits?  Is there a way to prove his lies with a poloygraph test (especially if he is a pathological liar would he fail)?  I ask you because now I don't trust attorney's and I don't trust judges.  You are basically my last resort.  Please guide me in the right direction.  Please don't let our daughter have to wait until its too late.\n \nSincerely,\nGina Campala\n772-464-6815 home\n772-359-9070 cell\n\n  _____  \n\nThe new MSN 8: <http://g.msn.com/8HMYENUS/2737>  smart spam protection and 2 months FREE* \n"

We have met briefly in the past.  I am General Counsel for the City of Jacksonville and former Chief of Staff to Mayor Delaney.\n \nI know of your intense interest in technology.  For nearly a year now, I have been working on a Telecommunications Master Plan for the City of Jacksonville.  After an RFP, a consultant (Black & Veatch) was selected to conduct the study.  I am Chair of a Task Force to assist the consultant.\n \nThis comprehensive study will (hopefully) make Jacksonville a national model on broadband deployment and seeks to create a countywide, high speed communications network that will be fundamental to economic development, education, safety, transportation, and residential uses.  The study is designed to take a comprehensive, visionary approach to creating such a network, including the deployment of fiber optics, wireless broadband, and other forms of telecommunications infrastructure. \n \nWe are planning a Technology Summit in Jacksonville for March or April to: (1) educate the public and policy makers on telecommunications infrastructure and what it means to economic development, education, public safety, modernizing government,  transportation, and our future, and (2) to reveal the preliminary findings and recommendations of our consultant on the Telecommunications Master Plan.\n \nI believe the summit, and this comprehensive study, is fundamentally important to the state's and city's future.  I am also very respectful of your schedule and the obvious competing demands for your time.  If at all possible, however, we would love to have you as our keynote speaker.  The Technology Summit is currently scheduled for Friday, April 4, 2003, but we have the dates of April 3, March 24, or March 28 if those are better for your schedule.  We would shift the summit to accommodate your schedule, if any of those dates are better for you.\n \nI completely understand if it is not possible for you to attend.  If you can, however, I believe we are working on a bold, visionary approach to technology that is important to the future of Jacksonville and the State of Florida.  Thank you for your consideration of this request.\n\n \n \nRichard A. Mullaney\nGeneral Counsel\nCity of Jacksonville\n117 W.

In it\nthere is an important message for GOVERNOR JEB BUSH.  Bush and Gray Davis\nplaced a wager on the Superbowl... As part of the bet, Davis owes Bush some\nCalifornia Wine.  In honoring the debt, Davis was going to ship Bush two\ncases of 1999 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon from Groth Vineyards of Napa\nValley.  This is great wine, which retails for $150 a bottle.  A classy gift\n(from such a cheap, deficit spending Governor), and a great one to receive,\nright?  Well, FLORIDA makes it a FELONY to directly ship this wine to its\nresidents.  Even worse, it cannot even be hand carried as Florida restricts\nan individual to bringing in no more than 1 gallon of wine.  As a matter of\nfact, a winery owner that ships to a Florida resident can be slapped with a\nFELONY.\n\nMany of you have heard me rant about this before, but this is the first\nmajor article I have seen in awhile that addresses this issue head-on.  For\nthe wine enthusiasts of Florida, I urge Governor Bush and the Florida\nlegislature to repeal these arcane shipping restrictions put in place by the\ndistributors, and allow Florida consumers to order wine to their homes, and\nto bring wine home from their travels in whatever quantity they would like.\nIt is about freedom, and this IS America!\n\nPlease read this article below, and spread the word!\n\nThe rest of the FlashReport follows.\n\nJon Fleischman\n______________________________________________\n\n2)\nBush can't pop Davis' bottle\nWine delivery snafu screws up governors' Super Bowl bet\nCarol Emert, Chronicle Staff Writer <mailto:cemert@sfchronicle.com>\nThursday, January 30, 2003\n\u00a92003 San Francisco Chronicle </chronicle/info/copyright/> | Feedback\n</select.feedback.html>\n\nGov. Gray Davis lost a case of California Cabernet in his Super Bowl bet\nwith Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, but paying up is proving tougher than scoring a\ntouchdown for Oakland.\nFlorida is one of 37 states that restrict direct shipping of wine under\nProhibition-era laws. The Sunshine State is among the harshest -- any winery\nowner that ships to a resident there can be extradited and slapped with a\nfelony.\nConsequently, a dozen bottles of 1999 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (retail\nprice: $150 per bottle) have been gathering dust this week at Groth\nVineyards and Winery, an esteemed Napa Valley producer.\n\"It's caught in the logistics,\" said Dennis Groth, co-owner of the winery\nand chairman of the Wine Institute, a trade group representing California\nwineries. \"I'm going to do this legally; I don't want to spend a night in\njail. \"\nFlorida law requires all wine shipments to be routed through a licensed\nnetwork of retailers and wholesalers.\nOne option would be for Davis to order the wine from a Florida liquor store\nand have it delivered to the governor's mansion. But the 1999 Reserve won't\nbe released until Saturday and isn't available in stores.\nDavis can't fly to Florida and personally deliver the vino, since Florida\nrestricts hand-carrying across the border to 1 gallon per resident. Davis is\nnot a Florida resident and a case equals 2.3 gallons anyway.\nGroth had planned to ask his Florida sales representative to deliver a case\nto the governor's mansion in two to three weeks, after the wine makes its\nregularly scheduled trip across the country. But under Florida law,\nsalespeople may deliver wine only for business-related sampling -- not home\nimbibing.\nGOING THE CHEAP ROUTE\nWhen confronted with the legal hurdles, Davis hit upon a speedier (and\ncheaper) solution: He will hand-carry two bottles of Groth Cabernet to Bush\nat the National Governors Association meeting in Washington, D.C., next\nmonth.\nThe two bottles -- instead of the case -- will settle the bet, said Davis\nspokesman Steve Maviglio.\nWhile Florida's laws may seem Byzantine -- even bizarre -- they are hardly\nunusual.\nOnly 13 states, including California, have signed \"reciprocity\" legislation\nallowing shipping of wine by common carriers such as UPS and FedEx. Several\nstates, such as New Hampshire, require wineries to get a permit to ship\nthere. Others, such as Utah, don't even allow a bottle of wine to be\nhand-carried in for personal consumption. Five states have made\nwine-importing a felony.\n\"If Florida were a reciprocal state, sending this wine to the governor would\nbe as easy as clicking on our Web site,\" said Groth.\nThe Wine Institute has been lobbying state governments for years to relax\nshipping restrictions. But wineries face an uphill battle against\nwholesalers, who want to maintain their lock on liquor transportation, and\nstate treasury officials, who fear that direct-shipping will cost them\nmillions in unpaid sales taxes.\nSome states also fear that minors will start ordering wine over the\nInternet, using their parents' credit cards.\nA federal law signed last fall by President Bush allows direct shipment of\nwine to states like Florida, where hand-carrying small amounts of wine is\nOK, but shipping is forbidden. The issue is legally murky, however, and none\nof the major carriers will make the deliveries, fearing state governments\nwill continue defending their laws.\nA solution may be coming through the courts. Florida is one of seven states\nwhere legal challenges are being waged to overturn wine shipping\nrestrictions.\nLate last year, a Florida appeals court rejected a lower-court decision\nupholding Florida's shipping ban. The lower court said the ban was necessary\nto collect taxes; the appeals court told them to prove it.\nA New York judge has overturned a similar shipping ban, saying it\ndiscriminates against out-of-state wineries. His decision has been stayed\npending an appeal.\nEventually, the issue is expected to land before the U.S. Supreme Court.\nDAVIS CAN BLAME DAVIS\nMeanwhile, Davis continues to pay for the Oakland Raiders' trouncing Sunday\nby the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\nThe gubernatorial staff is busy preparing a gift basket of avocados and\npistachios to send to Tallahassee, and fixings for a San Diego fish-taco\ndinner will be overnighted to Bush's personal chef.\nDirect shipping of fish is apparently legal in Florida.\n\n"

I have paid all the required fee's and supplied all of the information on numerous occasions but continue to hear additional requirements that were not stated before.  They will not give you a direct line to contact them and they do not return calls.  \n \nMy last conversation with them, they told me there was an error from the beginning and all of the paperwork must be filled out again.  All I requested of them is to accept a letter that I would fax immediately, that would provide all the information they were missing and end it that afternoon over the phone.  Unfortunately after an arguement, I gave up.  They would not accept anything and refused to help me again.\n \nI have spent in excess of $2,500.00 and hundreds of hours of time and would like to begin practicing as a Florida contractor.  \n \nThank-you in advance for your attention to my matter.

I know you were joking...but I still want to thank you for asking if I wanted to be the Lt. Gov. I only wish I had the preparation and background to be a serious contender.  My goodness, what an honor that would be to bestow upon my family!!!  On a serious note though -- please know, if you and Columba ever need my help, I will be there.  Just contact me.\n\nRe:  Today's BioFlorida Board Meeting -- The board completed and updated its strategic plan to help build Florida's bioscience sector, in partnership with EFI.  Items that might be of interest to you include:\n1.  Related to BioFlorida's Annual Conference.  Once again, the board wants you to be the conference keynote speaker.  The conference will be held on October 19 & 20 in Orlando.  Last year, they attracted over 230 conference participants.\n\n2.  Related to increasing the number of federal life science research facilities/centers in Florida (as recommended in EFI's biomedical tech discussion paper).  The board is attempting to identify all Florida responses to NIH RFP's, so we can garner support for these proposals.  BioFlorida will follow-up on your suggestion of using your D.C. office to support these proposals.  Three were identified today.\n\nOn a personal note, and I am going out on a limb here.  I am not sure whether you ever participate in functions that allow the average citizen an opportunity to know you as a person.  If so, I'd like to invite you to teach my adult Sunday School Class on a 3rd Sunday of your choice.\n\nAgain, it was good seeing you.  Please give my regards to Columba.  Take care!\n\nYour Friend,\nAlberta\n"

I believe you will be interviewing him on February 8th. \n \nI have had the pleasure of practicing with Mr. DeSerio for over eleven years.  Mr. DeSerio served as our former firm\u2019s appellate lawyer and handled not only appeals originating from our firm\u2019s trial work, but also from that of other firms.  Mr. DeSerio has extensive experience with the appellate process, as he has been counsel of record in over 150 reported appellate decisions.  As such, he would assist our former firm\u2019s trial lawyers regarding trial strategy, whether to pursue an appeal and with basic general research on the status of the law for a given issue.  \n \n            Besides the extensive experience Mr. DeSerio possesses in appellate law, Mr. DeSerio has also exhibited a deep concern for the welfare of our community, and in particular, in feeding the hungry.  He has donated enormous amounts of time to his church and our community by organizing events such as the Feast of Plenty, which is a seasonal food distribution to feed the homeless.  In 2001, Mr. DeSerio headed the event which was held one week prior to the Super Bowl in Tampa to distribute over 120,000 pounds of food to the needy.\n \n            Mr. DeSerio is very well spoken, extremely intelligent, and possesses the candor and integrity worthy of being an appellate judge.  Mr. DeSerio has earned the respect of many and is the paramount professional.\n \n            Because of the many outstanding personal and professional characteristics of Mr. DeSerio, I highly recommend his candidacy to you as a person immensely qualified to serve the people of Florida as an appellate judge.  If I can provide any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.  \n \nVery truly yours, \n \nLorena Hart Ludovici, Esquire \nGAYLORD MERLIN LUDOVICI \nDIAZ & BAIN \nOne Harbour Place \n777 South Harbour Island Boulevard \nSuite 900 \nTampa, Florida  33602-5701 \nTel:  (813) 221-9000 \nFax: (813) 221-9030 \n \nlludovici@gaylordmerlin.com\nwww.gaylordmerlin.com <http://www.gaylordmerlin.com/> \n"

Wheeler aired his\nconcerns at Tuesday night's board meeting.\n>\n> \"I am outraged,\" Wheeler said, adding that he asked other School Board\nmembers across the state if they thought the production was too extravagant.\n\"Nobody's ever heard of a $96,000 production for anything.\"\n>\n> Parents of the student actors appealed to the Osceola County School Board\nfor moral support, pledging to make good on the debt. They also asked for a\npublic statement explaining that Annie was funded privately and not with\ndistrict funds.\n>\n> Organizers are holding fund-raisers to cover a $48,399 deficit by the end\nof the district's fiscal year in June.\n>\n> \"It's an incredible operation. It's big business, and not one penny came\nfrom the school,\" said Frank Harmer, a Celebration parent involved in\nproducing the show. \"Who is to determine how parents should spend their\nmoney?\"\n>\n> He noted that the final production costs -- and the amount of the\ndeficit -- remain in dispute pending negotiations with vendors.\n>\n> Organizers had already spent $20,000 to $25,000 for the rights and music\nto Annie, as well as some set and costume costs, when district officials\ninformed them about a month before opening night that the play could not be\npresented in the former Tupperware Convention Center, which the district\nbought last year to convert into a performing-arts school. They then lined\nup space at Gaylord Palms, at a cost totaling about $60,000.\n>\n> By contrast, a production of Little Shop of Horrors at Gateway High School\nin Kissimmee, also performed in mid-November, was produced on a shoestring.\nStaging the play cost $4,700 -- $2,000 to rent a plant costume for a lead\nrole, $1,200 for music and licensing and $1,500 for props and the set. Costs\nwere covered with ticket sales, advertising and a candy fund-raiser.\n>\n> The Gateway High drama program used the school's theater for free, and a\nstaff member supervised students on light and sound equipment. Still, drama\nteacher Annie Harris said she could only dream of a budget as lofty as\nCelebration's Annie.\n>\n> \"It would be lovely, but life's not fair,\" she said.\n>\n> Becausemoney raised through ticket sales and private donations was\ndeposited into Celebration School accounts, the school could be responsible\nfor the loss, district officials said. Besides Wheeler, other School Board\nmembers did not voice any concerns about the shortfall.\n>\n> School Board Chairman Tom Greer chastised Wheeler for taking the issue to\nSuperintendent Blaine Muse, who supervises the leadership at the Celebration\nSchool, instead of first discussing it with fellow board members.\n>\n> \"I see this as going out on your own, and I'm not really happy about\nthat,\" Greer told Wheeler.\n>\n> Letitia Stein can be reached at 407-931-5934 or\nlstein@orlandosentinel.com.\n>\n>\n>\n> Copyright (c) 2003, Orlando Sentinel\n>\n> Visit OrlandoSentinel.com\n\n"

A few days ago, I observed something very\ndisturbing, and I wanted to inform you to this matter.  A few nights ago\nwhile I was working, two women came through my line, obviously mother and\ndaughter, with the daughter's toddler-aged child.  They had approximately\neight WIC checks, all valid as far as dates are concerned, which\naccumulated to about three gallons of milk and two dozen eggs, among\nother things.  The WIC checks amounted to close to $40.00.  Next, they\nhave a moderately sized order.  This order includes: Disney cereal, which\ncosts about $3.25 a box, sweets and candy, there may have been some soda\nin there, and the list goes on.  What disturbs me about this is that this\nlast order was about $70.00.  And they paid for it with EBT.  There were\nno fresh fruits or vegetables in this order.  I believed, before I saw\nthis, that EBT was supposed to pay for balanced, healthy meals for people\nwho otherwise cannot afford them.  Everything on that conveyor belt was\napproved for food stamps.  I know that because when someone pays with\ngovernment aid, we have a food stamp button we must push to separate the\norder in the computer and remove the taxes.  I personally believe that\nEBT should not pay for these people to \"live the high life\" of sorts with\nfood.  I also believe there need to be tougher restrictions on what is\ncovered by WIC.  Kraft singles cheese, 16oz, is covered by WIC.  This\npackage of cheese is approximately $2.25, if memory serves me correctly. \nThese people by no means should not have the absolute bare minimum, yet\nthey should also not be milking the government in order to live a nicer\nlife.  I appreciate your time in reading this, it is a very important\nissue to me.  I see our government being taken advantage for a lot in my\njob, and it bothers me to see it happen.  Again, thank you so much.  I\nwill look forward to hearing from you.\n\nMelissa Blake\nWinter Springs, FL\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!

        "body": "Attachments:\tCard for Jean Pierre Medani <inadem@comcast.net>\n\nDear Governor Bush;\n\nIt is hard for me to believe that I am sitting in front of my computer \nwriting this email to you.  Not just because of the issues I am \nconcerned about, but because I honestly cannot believe that my children \nwill suffer because of legislation that is so insensitive to their God \ngiven civil rights.\n\nHow dare the educational system say that our children have low IQ's \nbecause they cannot take the FCAT's like others and successfully pass!  \nI have two autistic children who are exceptionally bright and very high \nfunctioning.  I doubt that either of them would be able to take these \nexams the \"traditional\" way, but I can tell you that with the \nappropriate considerations made for their disability, they could pass \nthem.  \n\nI am curious to know if you know of a woman named Temple Grandin?  She \nhas autism.  When she was first diagnosed, doctors told her parents \nthat she was also mentally retarded because she could not speak and \nonly groaned or made incomprehensible sounds for words.  She threw \nsevere tantrums, scratched and clawed at herself and others and also \nplayed in her own feces.  Her parents refused to listen to the \nphysicians and sought \"special\" teachers and other educators to help \nher.  You see; she learned differently than others.  She thought \nin \"pictures\".  Many years have passed since that time and she is now a \nvery successful Associate Professor of Animal Sciences at the \nUniversity of Colorado.  She is known nationally and internationally \nfor her books (Thinking in Pictures and Emergence/Labeled Autistic) and \nis sought after for her designs and opinions on raising livestock \nhumanely.  \n\nGovernor Bush; if you are not familiar with Ms. Grandin, please take \nthe time to read her books.  Never in your life will you be able to \nstep into the mind of an autistic child and see and feel what they do.  \nI learned more about my own two children through this woman than she \nwill ever know.  Someday, I hope to shake her hand and thank her.  \n\nI think Ms. Grandin and Robert Steinberg have alot in common.  Mr. \nSteinberg wrote a book called \"Successful Intelligence\".  He is also \nliving proof that traditional methods of testing IQ's and knowledge do \nnot work for every child.  Exceptions were made for these people as \nchildren and they have gone on to prove that the educational systems we \nentrust our children to are not always right.\n\nIt has been said that \"We do not own the earth; We simply borrow it \nfrom our children.\"  How do we give it back to them Mr. Bush, if we are \nnot willing to invest in their futures?\n\nI can only hope and pray that you will continue to fight for the rights \nof disabled children in our educational system.  They deserve better \nthan what they are being offered and it disgusts me to see sorrow in \nthe eyes of such beautiful children at the hands of beaurocracy!\n\nMy family will pray for your strength and persistence in safeguarding \nthe education of our children.  I hope that you are able to make the \nchanges that are necessary as I would hate to regret my relocation to \nthe \"Sunshine State\".\n\nGod Bless You and Yours,\n\nMarsha A. Medani (Mother of Michaella and Nicolas)\n\nVisit us @ http://asprgr2.ownspot.com\n\"Children are our future... support autism research\"\n"

I want to \nhighlight again how critical this type of funding will be to our success \nover both the short and long term in accomplishing your vision for the \ncenter. In a follow-up meeting I had with President Wetherell, he expressed \nsolid support for new recurring general revenue to operate the FCRR.

When I discussed the\n>concept of this Center with Mary Laura and Commissioner Horne last\n>spring,\n>they were clear that your vision, and theirs, was for us to become the\n>premier center for reading research (both basic and applied) in the\n>country.

We also\n>agreed\n>that a major mission of the center would be to directly support the\n>acquisition and implementation of a Reading First Grant in\n>Florida.  Although I was clearly one among many in the preparation of\n>this\n>grant, and Mary Laura was instrumental in providing the consistent\n>leadership it took to assemble the grant, my own contributions to both\n>the\n>conceptualization and writing of this grant were substantial.  We have\n>also\n>already hired an excellent staff at FCRR who have been working very hard\n>to\n>develop materials (including a web based data management and reporting\n>system for all our Reading First assessments) and training that will be\n>critical to the success of the project as it unfolds over the next six\n>years.\n>I agreed to assume leadership of the center and try to build it to meet\n>your vision, partly based on the promise of Commissioner Horne that,\n>although they could not provide permanent funding last year, it would be\n>\n>forthcoming this year.  Last year, FSU contributed two faculty lines to\n>us\n>so we could start recruiting faculty for the center, and we have already\n>\n>hired one very good new faculty in psychology, and are interviewing\n>another\n>one this month.  FSU also told me that these lines were loaned\n>\"temporarily\" until our own funding was secured.\n>\n>In the fall of 2002, I gave a recurring budget request for the center to\n>\n>Mary Laura, and she told me she would get it placed in the DOE budget\n>request.  Apparently that request was deleted in the request the DOE\n>sent\n>to your office, or it was deleted during the budget process in your\n>office\n>(I am not really knowledgeable about this process, and have not been\n>able\n>to get precise information).

Any help you can provide us in this\n>\n>process would, of course, be most appreciated.\n>\n>Now, the idea about being more effective while saving money.

However,\n>at\n>least 20-30%  of our students have very little prospect of achieving at\n>grade level by third grade (even with improved, research based classroom\n>\n>instruction) unless they receive more intensive instruction for a\n>substantial period of time during the K-3 years.  The most effective way\n>to\n>reduce the overall class size estimate in the state is to use this money\n>to\n>hire \"intensive intervention\" teachers who can work within regular\n>classroom settings to provide very small group (3-4 students)\n>instruction\n>to the children most at risk for reading failure.  This will not require\n>\n>spending money on new school buildings and classrooms.  We know exactly\n>how\n>to train these \"intensive intervention\" specialists (they can be bright\n>paraprofessionals as well as certified teachers) to be effective with\n>small\n>groups of children in preventing the emergence of reading difficulties,\n>and\n>we know how to set this up in schools (its really the Hartsfield model\n>you\n>know something about already)\n>\n>If you would like me to write a short briefing paper on this concept,\n>documenting both the need for more intensive instruction as a way of\n>preventing reading problems, and the kind of instruction that is\n>required,\n>I would be happy to do so.  We can bring a good share of our children to\n>\n>grade level reading performance by training and supporting our classroom\n>\n>teachers more effectively (as we are trying to do in Reading First), but\n>we\n>will not succeed with another very large group of children if we do not\n>find a way to deliver the immediate intensive interventions that most\n>poor\n>and minority children need to \"catch up\" to their middle class\n>peers.

        "body": "\nDear Governor Bush:\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my e-mail.\n\nI can see why you would feel that the DOE should take on the responsibilities of monitoring the school district. However, when a crisis occurs such as the ones I mentioned in my message, parents need to be able to seek out local support.  The only way I can explain it is to offer an example.\n\nMy husband works for State Farm Insurance.  If an insured gets in an accident, he contacts his local agent.  The insured would feel lost if they had to contact the corporate office in Bloomington, ILL.   That is how parents look at the DOE.  They are not a household name, family friendly institution.  We think of the DOE as the president's office and not the first place to seek out help.\n\nIf the DOE is the place for parents to be contacting, maybe we need to somehow \"market\" their name within the community.  \n\nThank you for offering your perspective and I will certainly discuss it with other parents.\n\nAs a side note, I know that we have the ability to do what is right and there are a few schools that I have worked with who are outstanding and would make great role models.  I continue to sing their praise every chance I get.\n\nAlso, I would like to commend you for creating the FCAT Blue Ribbon Task Force.  I just heard the recommendations made by the committee and I am very excited to see the changes.\n\nI recognize that you are extremely busy so I appreciate the opportunity to share my thoughts.\n\nHave a wonderful weekend.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDebbie Merrigan\nmzdebbie@bellsouth.net\n"

Horne and his staff and Kathleen Shanahan.  For the record, these were intended to be two seperate meetings.  Our first meeting with Sec. Horne, Larry Wood, Wayne Pierson and Dan Woodring was to discuss the details of the privitization request and get some feedback from them on issues that need to be addressed as we move forward.  The second meeting was specifically for your Chief of Staff to address the role of the Governor in the process - the federal law clearly assigns the role of state guarantor to that of the Governor, not the chief state school officer.  As you recall, we addressed this issue in Miami.  It was never our intention, nor was it at our invitation, to have Sec. Horne and his staff, who are equally busy,  attend this second meeting.  It was as much to our surprise to see a room full of the same people at the second meeting.  We appreciate the time of your staff and would never schedule a meeting just for the sake of meeting.  Also for the record, Sallie Mae is a client we have represented for nearly two years.  They compensate us based upon a monthly retainer, just like all of our clients.  There are no benefits to us for additional meetings.  \n \nI just wanted to clear up any confusion and close the loop on this.  Let me know if you need to discuss further.\n \nChris\n"

Houston and Cincinnati have not been in neighborhoods or new public schools.\n\nThe largest municipal activity across the nation has been in constructing stadia and arenas for pro sports teams. As the $250 million FedExForum for the NBA Grizzlies rises there, Memphis Mayor Willie Herenton this week asked for a referendum to turn control of city schools over to Shelby County because of costs.\n\nYet all this pro sports construction has come with the clear approval of voters or their representatives. That includes Nashville. Measuring the returning value from this monumental municipal investment, however, is far from obvious. Economists and chambers of commerce differ sharply.\n\nThat's frightening fiscally, since Metro faces looming new costs for pro sports. The Coliseum needs more than $24 million in maintenance the next 17 years. A ticket tax would only cover $17 million of that bill. A resolution passed this week by the Council asks the Sports Authority and Mayor Bill Purcell to explore enclosing and adding seating to The Coliseum to attract events like the Super Bowl.\n\nIn two cities today, there is little disagreement about the value. Oakland and Tampa Bay have teams in the Super Bowl, the mother of all media events. The Super Bowl is the ultimate prize in our capitalist society. Having a chance to play in the Super Bowl is worth a lot to a lot of cities and people.\n\nJust how much is enough and too much to invest for a city remains unanswered. There are some certainties: The cost to maintain pro sports always keeps rising. And no one has yet to put an accurate number on the returning value.\n\nThat's ironic for sports businesses that rely on instant replay to correct errors and run games to the second.\n\nMeasuring the Titans\n\nThe Titans cost Metro taxpayers $11 million a year from the budget. That includes bond payments for notes sold to build the Coliseum. It also accounts for a $1 million annual maintenance fee.\n\nThat sum is not going to break any major city's budget. It is enough, however, to keep a mayor from fully pursuing new initiatives like the need for safe, decent affordable housing here. Purcell's administration applies the following standard when sports collide other community interests:\n\n''We've got certain obligations we know, the stadium is one,'' said Bill Phillips, Metro deputy mayor. ''That's part of the base in planning the budget, like the basic cost of police work. The priorities are safety and health and education, not necessarily in that order. So if it's a difference in spending a little extra on something like sports and education, then education is going to get first.''\n\nThe Predators take more than $5 million a year from the budget. That cost is rising because the arena is operating at a deficit.\n\nThe pro sports bill in Nashville is climbing closer to $20 million a year. That's the equivalent of four new police precincts. Yet few people are complaining. Ludye Wallace, former president of the local NAACP and now Metro councilman, was sponsor of the resolution for new Coliseum spending.\n\nIt's easy to push that idea now. Most of the Midstate is still basking in the Titans season. The team went from a 1-4 start to the AFC championship game. Fans and retailers celebrated. Merchandise sales meant more sales tax, the lifeblood of state government.\n\nA tremendous amount of good will is generated in a city from such a season. It appeals across race and class, bringing people together to root for the same thing. That's worth a lot. Teams also set up charities. Players become ambassadors and role models.\n\n''It is very difficult to say it brings in X amount of dollars,'' Phillips said. ''As for the benefits, one of the indicators is downtown. You can see activity. It is generating activity that wasn't there the night before. A Monday Night Football game is something you can't buy, and if it is a beautiful night and the skyline is shown, that is a benefit, and you don't know how many people say 'I want to go there for the weekend.'\n\n''Ticket holders (60%) for the Titans games are from other counties, and they wouldn't be here on Sunday. I don't think anyone argues there is a plus factor.''\n\nThe credibility of claims of value suffer, however, when NFL owners get involved. Titans' owner Bud Adams projected that his team pumped $109 million a year in direct spending into the economy. Economists dispute such estimates, including claims that the Super Bowl means a $500 million boost to the host city. Robert Baade at Lake Forest College in Illinois says the real impact is $50 million.\n\nSeparating myth from fact\n\nPro sports recirculate existing spending income in a city or area, not create new wealth, say economists. It means taking sales from one business to give to another.\n\nThe Commercial-Appeal, in surveying economists about FedExForum, reached this consensus: ''Much of the money generated by sales in and around an arena comes mostly at the expense of businesses elsewhere in the area.''\n\nNationwide, 10% to 20% of football fans come to games outside a home team's metro area, bringing a party of four, The Houston Chronicle reported in quoting Patrick Rishe, an economist at Webster University in St. Louis. That means tourism spending in an NFL city is overestimated. It also explains why several prominent restaurants have closed in downtown Nashville despite pro sports.\n\nThe Chronicle also surveyed economists on the impact of the new Reliant Stadium. Beyond the recirculation of spending, they said ''another mistake these [NFL] studies sometimes make is assuming out-of-towners attending a game have visited a community solely for that reason rather than taking in a game while already being in Houston on business. ... A sports franchise may actually depress an economy because the dollars generally go to a team owner and players who may live elsewhere during the off-season and that spending at places such as restaurants return more money to a local economy.''\n\nReliant Stadium's impact probably is about $100 million a year, The Chronicle concluded. But it's also a domed stadium. It gets events year-round. The Chronicle's conclusion makes Adams' projections of $109 million here wildly optimistic.\n\nNo one can dispute that NFL teams bring in big TV money to a home city. TV and the teams provide exposure and great entertainment. Most major U.S. cities are deeply involved in making their municipalities more competitive for the growing entertainment dollar.\n\nIn his book Fantasy City, author John Hannigan writes that a long-term benefit to cities in the pursuit of pro sports teams is the private-public partnerships established. They become a force in redeveloping dilapidated areas of downtown and bringing back the dollars of the middle and upper classes.\n\nThe flip side is that entertainment centers hurt the poor people already living there. To bring the middle and upper classes back to spend, these places must be made to look safe. That means keeping dangerous-looking folks out, Hannigan wrote.\n\nImage or illusion is everything in pro sports. TV money pays salaries for NFL players. The 2002 salary cap per team was more than $70 million, The Chronicle said. That's a nice business payroll for a city. But not every Titan or Predator lives in Nashville. Some live in Williamson County. The Chronicle said studies show half or fewer of players live in the home city.\n\nThankfully, Tennessee is not like Ohio, yet. Governments there have spent $2 billion-plus on stadia and arenas the past 10 years. The Columbus Dispatch asked economists to measure the economic impact.\n\n''If you want economic development, you bring in a manufacturer or improve the schools. ... The only times you see it [pro sports] making economic sense is from people who are paid to say that,'' said Kevin Grace at the University of Cincinnati.\n\nWrites Hannigan: ''Despite their symbolic value, however, professional sports teams and facilities rarely constitute a good financial deal for the city. Contrary to the hype, professional sports franchises are essentially small-scale businesses which account for no more than half of 1% of jobs or salaries in any urban county with 300,000 or more residents. This compares against leisure facilities such as restaurants and bars, which provide nearly 7% of jobs \u2026 .''\n\nPro sports teams certainly can be considered a plus for a city. But they must no longer be portrayed as an economic factor and thus an investment. They are an amenity, an extra that boosts good will and exposure and thus an expenditure. So come budget time, this new, accurate awareness should put pro sports in its proper place \u2014 to wait for its money and no longer move to the head of the long line. ?\n\n\nTOP <>  | HOME <http://www.tennessean.com/>  | LOCAL NEWS <http://www.tennessean.com/local/>  | CUSTOMER SERVICES <http://www.tennessean.com/services/>  \nSPORTS <http://www.tennessean.com/sports/>  | BUSINESS NEWS <http://www.tennessean.com/business/>  | OPINION/LETTERS <http://www.tennessean.com/opinion/>  | ENTERTAINMENT <http://www.tennessean.com/entertainment/>  \nFEATURES <http://www.tennessean.com/features>  | WEATHER <http://www.tennessean.com/weatherreport/index.shtml>  | PHOTO  <http://www.tennessean.com/gallery> GALLERY | OBITUARIES <http://www.tennessean.com/obits/>  | CELEBRITIES <http://www.tennessean.com/celebrities/>  \nIN-DEPTH REPORTS <http://www.tennessean.com/special/>  | CLASSIFIEDS <http://classifieds.tennessean.com>  | EMPLOYMENT <http://tennessean.com/employment>  | SUBSCRIBE TO THE PAPER <https://secure.tennessean.com/subscribe>  \nCARS.COM <http://www.cars.com/carsapp/tenness/?srv=parser&act=display&tf=/index-default.tmpl>  | APARTMENTS.COM <http://www.apartments.com/search/oasis.dll?Area3=Y&page=SubArea&state=TN&rgn2=187&partner=tenness&prvpg=3>  \n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2003 The Tennessean\nA  <http://www.gannett.com> Gannett Co.

A getaway car was waiting outside. We are all extremely proud of Bryan in that a corrections officer with only 5 years of experience had the presence of mind to know how to handle this difficult situation. Of course, we are all very thankful that he was not seriously injured or killed in the process. I understand that he has been nominated for an outstanding law enforcement award. I know it would mean the world to him if you could acknowledge his efforts by sending him a letter; it would be wonderful for him to know that his bravery was recognized by more than just his family.

I greatly appreciate your assistance and I look \nforward to perhaps meeting you soon.\n\nAgudath Israel of America, founded in 1922, is a broad-based Orthodox Jewish\n\ncoalition movement functioning under the guidance of the Council of Torah \nSages, a distinguished rabbinic policy-making body whose members are senior \nTorah scholars of international renown. In August 1999, Agudath Israel of \nSouth Florida was founded in order to expand and focus efforts specifically \nin the Jewish Community of South Florida.\n\nAgudath Israel of America advocates for the rights of Orthodox Jews in the \nnation's workplaces and neighborhoods, and for the protection and needs of \nJewish religious institutions. It also provides information about the \nAmerican Orthodox community to the media and general public, and takes \npublic positions on important issues of moral and social concern.\n\nJewish education, the backbone of Jewish continuity, of Agudath Israel of \nAmerica's prime concerns, and the organization sponsors a host of projects \nand endeavors to help\nbring the texts and teachings of Jewish tradition to Jews across the \ncountry, as well as to help foster and enhance the observance of Judaism \nnationwide.\n\nAgudath Israel of America is active as well in promoting Jewish life and \nwelfare in the nations of the former Soviet Union, in Israel and in other \nlands, hosting a number of\nhumanitarian and religious projects around the globe. Agudath Israel also \nassists Jews in other lands in need of physical protection or immigration \nassistance.\n\nAmong Agudath Israel of America's numerous endeavors on the \"home front\" of \nthe American Jewish community are: an employment service, vocational \ntraining and counseling services, housing and neighborhood preservation \ninitiatives (including mortgage counseling and homeowner/tenant counseling \nservices), assistance to food-for-the-hungry agencies, and a host of \nsenior-citizen and children's welfare projects.\n\nAgudath Israel of America's Orthodox Jewish Archives is a repository of \ndocuments and photographs of Jewish life over the past several decades that \nserves students and scholars alike in their explorations of recent Jewish \nhistory.\n\nThe Jewish Observer, an English-language journal of thought and opinion, Dos\n\nYiddishe Vort, its Yiddish-language counterpart, and Coalition, a periodical\n\nof news and Current events, are Agudath Israel of America's official \npublications, and serve to inform and educate their readerships about the \nOrthodox Jewish world.

        "subject": "Bond Sale and Proposal for Additional Refundings",
        "body": "\nGovernor Bush:\n\n\tWe sold $277 million of PECO bonds yesterday at 4.31%. The\ntransaction was part refunding, part new money.  The refunding piece\ngenerated present-value savings of $13.9 million.  I was pleased with the\nsale and the level of savings generated.\n\n\tIn thinking about ways we can save the State money, it occurred to\nme that it may be an opportune time, with the President's tax proposal on\nthe table, to pursue changes to the tax code beneficial to State and local\ngovernments.  Current federal tax law limits State and local governments'\nability to lower its borrowing cost through refinancings by allowing only\none advance refunding during the life of a bond issue.  The policy\nunderlying this rule is to limit the federal subsidy (the feds consider\ntax-exempt debt as a federal subsidy because the interest is not subject to\nfederal income taxes) for tax-exempt bonds.  The practical effect on the\nState is to prevent us from lowering our debt service costs through\nrefinancing for bonds that have been advance refunded previously.\n\n\tThe State has approximately $4.8 billion of debt that cannot be\nadvance refunded a second time.  Of this amount, approximately $2.8 billion\ncould be advance refunded at lower rates based on current interest rate\nlevels.  I estimate potential gross debt service savings of approximately\n$161 million (or $121 million on a present value basis) if the State were\nallowed an additional advance refunding of its debt.  In our case, most of\nthe savings is on PECO bonds so the savings could help us pay for class size\nreduction.  To the extent the savings are used for additional school\nconstruction, it could also provide stimulus for the economy.  \n\n\tI am bringing this to your attention because it seems timely in\nlight of the President's tax plan and reasonably consistent with some of the\npolicy objectives underlying the proposal.  It also has the added virtue of\npotentially saving the State money during these difficult economic times by\nallowing us to take advantage of lower interest rates.  Additionally, there\nis some precedent to this idea in that Congress allowed New York City\nissuers an additional advance refunding in connection with the relief\nprovided for rebuilding lower Manhattan from the destruction caused by the\n9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\n\tBy way of background, an additional advance refunding seems to be a\nperennial request from State and local government groups, other issuers of\ntax-exempt bonds and industry trade groups so it is not really a novelty on\nCapitol Hill.  I would not be surprised to see it surface again in\nconnection with the tax bill.  Also, Treasury is never keen on expanding\nauthority for tax-exempt bonds.  I just wanted you to be aware of this and\nconsider whether it has sufficient merit to pursue in some way.\n\n\tAs always, I am available at your convenience to discuss this issue\nor answer any questions you may have.  Please let me know if you have any\ninterest in pursuing this.\n\n"

They partner on many projects with Steve Goldsmith at ACS and with Nextel.  My concept is to take the ChildTrack program that Steve told you about and combine it with the Nextel phone and snap on camera.\n \nBasically it would work like this.\nCase worker arrives at childs location.  Dials office number on Nextel Phone.  Child Track application runs on Nextel phone, caseworker enters childs ID and answers 3-5 questions on basic condition.  Then caseworker uses Nextel camera to take childs picture.  All Nextel phones have a GIS chip and time stamp.  So central database is immediately updated with Child's picture, location and timestamp.  This would eliminate ability to falsify visit reports.  It also would satisfy blue-ribbon panel recommendation for pictures as well as provide photographic evidence of childs condition every time they are visited.  There are a lot of other features and benefits, but that was the high point.\n \nEvery caseworker already has a cell phone so that cost will be minimal.  Steve says that with a better tracking system the state should be able to pull down a significant amount of Title IV-E dollars which (according to Steve) may completely offset costs.\n \nNextel and ACS are high on the potential for the project.  I am going to try and get with Jerry Regier soon to discuss, but wanted to see if you had any feedback first.\n \nThanks\nRoy Cales\n850-309-1115\n850-294-8350  \n"

I hope they're taking time to put mortar between all those bricks.\n\nThis is a California gold rush, Florida style.\n\nIt seems the only one not getting rich from it is the city that first owned the mine -- Orlando.\n\nThe city had a one-shot opportunity to profit from the hottest piece of real estate in Florida -- the old Naval Training Center -- and flubbed it.\n\nThink of that as Mayor Glenda Hood reveals a city budget deficit she kept under wraps until after she got the secretary of state job from Jeb Bush. Hood is the one who gave the Navy base away for less than a song.\n\nHow hot is this place? In 1998, Orlando Partners, the development group that initially won the right to the site, said home prices would range from the low $100,000s to $275,000. In other words, there would be room for the middle class.\n\nThat price was jacked up in 2001 to $150,000 for a condominium, but even that number was fantasy. Homes begin at about $275,000, if you can find one at that price. More than likely, you'll be looking at $300,000-plus for an entry-level home.\n\nYou can barely get in a condominium for less than $220,000.\n\nEven those prices don't reflect the true cost of housing.\n\nThe Pritzker family, which is developing the site, took full advantage of one of Florida's biggest real-estate scams -- the Community Development District. It raised almost $76 million through bond sales to pay for the infrastructure and parks.\n\nThose who move into Baldwin Park now must pay off many of these bonds.\n\nEven if you buy the least expensive house, you will have to pay $750 a year to the Community Development District for the next 30 years. You will have to pay almost $2,000 if you buy one of the more expensive homes.\n\nYou will have to pay another $400 a year to maintain infrastructure such as lighting, a cost that can vary from year to year.\n\nYou will have to pay another $550 a year to the property owners association for the upkeep of common areas, another variable cost.\n\nIf you buy a town house, there is a $215 monthly service fee.\n\nNone of this includes city taxes.\n\nBut even at these prices, even in these uncertain economic times, inventory is moving fast.\n\nThe salespeople don't beg. They don't follow you out the door. They readily pass you on to the competitors. They know if you don't buy from them, someone else will walk through the door soon enough. Life on commission never was easier.\n\nIt didn't take a genius to see the potential. All you had to do was look at prices at Celebration in Osceola County and translate them to a location sandwiched between Winter Park and Orlando.\n\nAnd Glenda Hood dumped it for $6,900 an acre, plus a bundle of incentives that added millions more to the Pritzker fortune.\n\nWe didn't even get a regional park out of the deal.\n\nMike Thomas can be reached at 407-420-5525\nor mthomas@orlandosentinel.com.\n\n\n\n\n"

Diane Carr  \n\n \n\nSecretary Carr:\n\nMy office has been working in conjunction with the Central intake Unit (CIU) to resolve Mr. Morrissette's licensing issue. \n\nMr. Morrissette holds a Mechanical Contractors license which qualified Latent Mechanical Inc. CIU received Mr. Morrissette's application to obtain a Certified General Contractors license on October 18, 2002. His application was validated on October 28, 2002 and was issued a deficiency letter on October 31, 2002. In the deficiency letter CIU requested:\n\n1. A master individual application to be completed and be submitted.\n\n2. A master organization application for qualified business to be completed and be submitted. (Mr. Morrissette wished to qualify Latent Contracting Inc. through the GC license.)\n\n3. He needed to answer a question in regards to any organizational relationships on page 21 of the application. This question asks if an applicant qualifies any company other than the one he is presently trying to qualify.\n\n4. He needed to resubmit a bank verification letter. The one that he submitted did not meet the minimum cash requirement of $10,000.00.\n\nCIU did not receive the information from Mr. Morrissette. Subsequently, CIU determined that Mr. Morrissette held his mechanical license for less than one year. Pursuant to board rule he was not able to qualify a second business. He could, however, operate with both licenses under the name \"Latent Contracting Inc.\" On January 29, 2003, Jessica McGregor in CIU telephoned Mr. Morrissette and attempted to explain and walk him through the process of filling out the appropriate application. Apparently, there was some confusion, and Ms. McGregor was unable to reach a resolution. \n\nMs. McGregor explained the paperwork to me, and I subsequently telephoned Mr. Morrissette to reassure him that we could resolve the matter. He was very pleased. We faxed him the necessary applications, which he subsequently returned completed. My analyst, Stacey Merchant, and Ms. McGregor handled the necessary processing immediately, and I arranged to waive any additional licensing fees. I left a detailed message with Mr. Morrissette's office and, to the best of my knowledge, this matter is now resolved.\n\nPlease let me know if I can be of any further assistance.\n\nTim Vaccaro\n\nExecutive Director\n\nConstruction Industry Licensing Board\n\n(850) 922-2701\n\n-----Original Message-----\n"

I have paid all the required fee's and supplied all of the information on numerous occasions but continue to hear additional requirements that were not stated before.  They will not give you a direct line to contact them and they do not return calls.  \n \nMy last conversation with them, they told me there was an error from the beginning and all of the paperwork must be filled out again.  All I requested of them is to accept a letter that I would fax immediately, that would provide all the information they were missing and end it that afternoon over the phone.  Unfortunately after an arguement, I gave up.  They would not accept anything and refused to help me again.\n \nI have spent in excess of $2,500.00 and hundreds of hours of time and would like to begin practicing as a Florida contractor.  \n \nThank-you in advance for your attention to my matter.
