Happy New Year to you and your family.

Have two things I want to get with you on. Thought of something for your reading program that might be helpful.

Thanks,
Sandy

Subject: Maggie Roger's concern for Jay Leonard from Crawfordville,Fl


I am very concerned about a situation that I think is out of control.   Jay Leonard is a young man who is paralyzed from the waist down.He has two small children and he supports his family.  He is not on welfare.  He went to  school and learned to use the cad program and he does drafting.   He has worked with several architects but since it is so hard for him to get around, he works in his own space rather than their office.  He puts on paper what people tell him to.  I have watched him first hand and I know this is what he does.  He does not do the design, he doesn't do the engineering, he simply does the drafting and then it is checked by the architect and if it needs it, the architect seals it.   Now it seems an architect in Crawfordville has decided to charge Jay Leonard with practicing as an architect.  He filed a charge in DBPR and the case  number is 2001-09523.  Jay Leonard barely makes it in life, but he does survive.  I think this insensitive attack on him from an irate architect is  so unfair.  Is there anything that can be done to help this young man.  He hasn't even answered the charges yet and I am so concerned for his welfare and the welfare of his wife and children.  If you have someone who can help, Jay Leonard's phone number is  850 926 2821 .  Can you let me know if you can help.  Thank you so much.  I am sorry to miss your inauguration.  I missed the last one too.  Glad you had a nice family ship trip.   God Bless   Maggie Rogers 407 599 0260

Subject:	The Bill to Stop Airport Licensing

Governor Bush;
I have been informed that thereï¿½s a bill pending that would stop the licensing by DOT of private airports in Florida.
I am a pilot, operate a Cessna Skylane and have one of those private airports.
I feel that this bill, if implemented, would not be in the best interests of any or all of the parties affected.
Many thanks for the ability to communicate with you in this fashion.
Best regards,
Ron Moss
