Mr. Haugabook:
 
We had met at the Tim Guzzle award dinner last month and your wife taught my daughter, Sophia, computers at Robinson High School.
 
The purpose of my email is to learn how I could find out if the State Tax Initiative would help TECO and perhaps speed up the time table for the installation of pollution control equipment at the Big Bend Plant...the 30 percent for accelerated depreciation could provide the financial incentive, improve the Tampa Bay environment sooner and hopefully the purchase would be made from another Florida Company further stimulating the Florida Economy.
 
Imagine the goodwill that would also be fostered with the surrounding residential community and environmental groups.
 
What do you think?  Could you find out or who at TECO could I talk to about this to learn if it is possible?
 
Thank you,

Dear Governor Bush:

As I write you this letter I am still so deeply moved after being a part
of the bill signing ceremony for the breast cancer research license
plate.  What an incredible honor to have had this chance to meet with
you, Lt. Governor Brogan, and the many legislators that attended.

When I came up with the license tag idea, I never envisioned having a
once in a lifetime opportunity of meeting you directly.  To give you a
little background as to the significance of this tag on a personal
level, my mother is a survivor and has been my inspiration throughout
this very long process.  This has been a labor of love for myself, as
well as the Coalition.

For me, the most proud moments were the day the license tag was approved
from the Legislators and April 29, 2002 at bill signing.  It is hard to
put into words all the emotions I felt.  I am most grateful for our
lobbyist Ronald Book who took on this cause pro bono and worked
tirelessly to ensure the legislative passage of HB441.

Research is the only way we can learn the causes of this disease and
hopefully find out how to "End Breast Cancer" forever.  This tag will be
an added weapon in this fight.

Thank you Governor Bush for launching the breast cancer research license
plate, Florida will shine a little brighter.

Thank you for caring,

Subject:	Re: Cap on public school class size on November's ballot

First rule of brainstorming - all ideas are considered. Here's two crazy thoughts.  
1) Corporations pay millions of dollars to put their name on a stadium, i.e., Raymond James Stadium or the First Union Center.  What if company's could put their name on a school, like Tropicana Middle School.  The company would be responsible for subsidizing some or all of that school's operating budget.
2) The State of Florida could be the first school to enter into exclusive contracts with big name (deep pocketed) corporations/vendors and allow a) only Coca Cola machines in all high schools, b) fruit juice companies in middle or elementary schools. c) All sports teams would exclusively use only Gatorade or Poweraide sports drinks. d) Nike or Reebok or Adidas would supply all uniforms for all the public school system. e) The public school system would use only McGraw Hill textbooks. f) Cleaning supply company's would have the exclusive contracts to supply all cleaning supplies..  The possibilities are endless.  

All these exclusive contracts would be for subsidizing the State's education budget.  It would enable you to, as you put it in your t.v. commercials, pay teachers more, hire more teachers, etc. 

Desperate times call for desperate (creative out of the box) thinking.  Is it not a fact that if 9-11 didn't happen our education budget, our state's budget, wouldn't be in the shape it's in now?

I often wake up in the middle of the night with thoughts like these.  Have a blessed day!

GOv meet w/CEO's here for first mtg, then
CEO's go as a group to mtg w/ Sen King - SEn King then invites other senators to mtg and has a press avail post that mtg
 
IT will be sen king's press event
He/they will determine who will be involved in press and how /where they will do it.
VOte will probably not be wed, but i said we understood that and were fine with that -- we just wanted Sen King to use the CEO visit to get credit for action later in week.
 
SO - they may call and invite gov to press avail
it is not ours to run/organize etc, just to go, if/when we are invited

May 1, 2002

Dear Governor Bush:

My message in this letter is simple:  I am truly outraged by Senator
King's
attempt to poison the Everglades restoration funding bill with his
amendment to strangle citizen input to development debates.  His
underhanded gamesmanship that tacked a citizen-hostile amendment to the
Everglades funding bill -- so cherished by Florida's citizens -- is
downright shameful.

I've been following Florida state politics for four (4) years now.  Some
state legislature actions have been laudable.  But far more often, the
pattern is that of the Florida legislature concocting secret and
not-so-secret plans to trample citizens' rights and interests.  I am
disillusioned, disappointed and not proud of what I see.

I urge you to do the right thing.  Veto HB 813 and demand that the
legislature strip out King's amendment and bring you a clean bill,
untainted less-than-honorable shenanigans.

Sincerely,



Barbara Seeley Curtis

EVERGLADES RESTORATION PROJECT ONE OF SIX RECOGNIZED AT INTERNATIONAL
ENGINEERING COMPETITION
--SFWMD engineers awarded for their engineering excellence--

TALLAHASSEE -- The South Florida Water Management District was among six
finalists recognized at the annual Outstanding Projects and Leaders (OPAL)
awards gala April 27 in Los Angeles in the prestigious American Society of
Civil Engineers (ASCE) 2002 Outstanding Civil Engineering Achievement
competition for two major components of the Everglades Construction Project:
Stormwater Treatment Areas 1 West and  2. The completion of these two STAs
is
a significant milestone in the overall Everglades restoration program. 
	"This is a well-deserved recognition for the professional engineers
involved with restoring America's Everglades," said DEP Secretary David B.
Struhs. "Their work is known and respected worldwide. Along with the
recognized high quality of their work, they continue to accomplish their
mission both on time and on budget."
Dr. H. Gerard Schwartz Jr., P.E., president of the ASCE, presented a
finalist
trophy to District Deputy Executive Director Joe Schweigart at the black-tie
event, recognizing the STAs for their engineering and mechanical excellence,
as well as the project's benefits to the environment and society.
Schweigart
accepted it on behalf of the more than 50 District engineers and support
staff, as well as over 30 consultant firms and contractors, who worked on
the
3 ½ -year, $180 million project. The Everglades Construction Project was
showcased in a video at the ceremony. 
"To be recognized as building one of the best civil engineering projects in
the world is a tremendous honor for the District," said South Florida Water
Management District Governing Board Chair Trudi Williams. "The success of
the
STAs reflects the high standard of excellence, creativity and commitment of
our staff and contractors to meet an immense challenge." 
(more)


Established in 1960, the Outstanding Civil Engineering Achievement award
annually recognizes the project that best illustrates superior civil
engineering achievement and represents a significant contribution to civil
engineering progress and society. The award honors the team of engineers
rather than an individual. 
The six finalists were selected from a number of very strong projects
among 33 entries from around the world.  The other finalists were
Bibliotheca
Alexandrina in Alexandria, Egypt; JFK Terminal 4 in Jamaica, New York; the
I-15 Design/Build Reconstruction  Project in Salt Lake City, Utah; the
Experience Music Project in Seattle, Washington; and the Seven Oaks Dam in
Highland, California. The overall winner was the Utah Department of
Transportation for the I-15 Design/Build Reconstruction Project. 
The 1994 Everglades Forever Act mandated construction of six stormwater
treatment areas to improve water quality in the Everglades, including STA
1-West and STA-2.  These large, constructed wetlands reduce the level of
phosphorus entering the Everglades using naturally occurring biological
processes and large pumps that enhance the outward flow of treated water.
These six STAs will remove more than 160 metrics tons or phosphorus per year
when fully operational.
STA-1 West, in central Palm Beach County, removes phosphorus from
agricultural stormwater prior to entering the Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee
National Wildlife Refuge, also known as Water Conservation Area 1. STA-2, in
southern Palm Beach County, filters and discharges water to Water
Conservation Area 2A. Each system covers more than 10 square miles of land.

Subject:	DOE Cutbacks to the Developmentally Disabled

We have learned that Department of Education staff has asked that funds be taken from the Adult Handicapped Fund in order to address deficits in the VR and Blind Services Programs.   It is extremely unfair to adults with disabilities that one of the programs benefiting them should be compromised in order to benefit another.  The individuals who receive the benefits of the Adult Basic Education provided through the Adult Handicapped Fund are those who will likely never be able to be competitively employed, and therefore, not able to benefit from VR services.  In Miami-Dade, approximately 2,863 adults with disabilities are registered at 25+ agencies.  Each receives an average of 25-30 hours of educational services weekly.  While we recognize that there are many competing funding priorities, we urge you NOT to reduce funding for the DOE’s Adult Handicapped Program.

the press event went very well.  The Leader met w/ the CEOs for about 25-30 minutes and then brought the press in for about 15 minutes.  The CEOs brought up some very good points with them, and gave them hard data as to how this legislation would help their businesses/employees, which is what these reporters were looking for.  We felt very good about it.  AP, The Miami Herald and the Times Union (the three which we invited) all showed and will be writing about the meeting.

Subject: Pataki Letter/request
Importance: High


Gov. Pataki has sent a letter to Republican Governors asking the Governors to join him in renouncing the latest wave of brutal attacks in Israel.  According to Pataki’s Washington Director, The White House supports the effort and Pataki would appreciate Gov’s help on this matter.  It is a bipartisan initiative; Governor Gray Davis is working on his colleagues.
 
I have attached the statement in Word Doc and have included below.  Pls advise.
 
 
   Governors’ Declaration of Principles
 
 
1. We, Governors representing individual states of the United States of America, declare our steadfast support for the State of Israel and for peace in the Middle East.
 
2. We wholeheartedly deplore and reject acts of terrorism and the deliberate targeting of innocent civilians, and call for an immediate end to the campaign of incitement, terror and violence, particularly homicide bombings, which have claimed countless innocent lives, and derailed the peace process.
 
3. We recognize that the United States and Israel are allies in the defense of freedom, tolerance and democracy; when those ideals are attacked anywhere, they are attacked everywhere.
 
4. We stand in solidarity with the people of Israel and renew our commitment to a viable, lasting and secure peace.
 
5. We support the President’s call upon all parties in the region to do their utmost to fight terrorism and to achieve peace in the region.

Dear Governor Bush: 

I was very interested in the message you sent out yesterday.  I believe it was last week when First Coast News did a piece on your school funding initiatives in response the ads the State is running.  They interviewed two teachers and Terry Brady...Terry Brady being the focus of the piece.  The piece was not a positive piece for your school programs.  The reporter only briefly mentioned that Terry was associated with the Democratic Party (which she is HIGHLY associated with in town) and only said the additional funding wasn't enough, not mentioning how it compared to prior administrations and their increases (or lack of)....I meant to e-mail Vivian since she is out of town to tell her.  I'll copy her on this e-mail. 
Somehow, we will have to get the local media to be fair and balanced!!!  Do you have numbers available to publicize on the prior administrations' per student increases??? That was the focus on that piece. 

When I was with Sysco, I had two hotels in Orlando I had to call on.  Before 9/11 the hotel off International Drive was wondering how to meet sales budgets, and after 9/11 it was not even a thought.  On my last visit to them in March they were booked up!!!!  The other hotel catered to the business traveler, and they, too, were seeing business increase on my March visit. 

Just thought I would let you know the person on the street's perspective!

Subject:	Tax Breaks for Corporations......STOP

This is addressed to our Govenor, Jeb Bus,  Senator McKan, and Speaker Mr. Feeney:

I want you to know how angry I am at the thought of the bill you are considering  that will give $400 million in tax breaks to corporations.  Don't get me wrong I have supported some tax incentives for corporations in the past, they have gotten out of hand, and now we are in a position where we can not afford it.  Just like we do at home when you are short you have to stop giving your money away.  We need to create more taxes not give tax breaks.

No one wants to pay more but reality is we need it to support education, health care and the programs to keep our people safe.    Also I do not approve of spending the trust fund money that was set aside for a specific purpose.

Also we need more money for TANF  to give services like counseling, drug treatment etc. to the people on welfare so they can get ahead and overcome family and life situations.

Thanks for hearing my thoughts

Florida leads the Southeast in meeting Clean Air Act requirements
-- EPA report cites success in controlling large sources of pollution --

	TALLAHASSEE -- According to a recent report by the U.S.
Environmental
Protection Agency, Florida is the first state in the Southeast, and only one
of three in the country, to have issued all federally required permits to
its
large stationary sources of air pollution.  Since the passage of the current
Clean Air Act in 1990, Florida has issued permits to 452 facilities compared
to a combined total of 330 in the only other states to achieve 100 percent
success -- Oregon and South Dakota.

	"I am grateful that the state's aggressive efforts have been
recognized," said Department of Environmental Protection Secretary David B.
Struhs.  "By meeting all of these air pollution  permitting requirements in
a
timely fashion, Floridians have documented proof that they are breathing
cleaner air because these large plants are operating within federal as well
as state clean air laws."

	These large facilities, such as electric power plants, are regulated
under Title V of the Clean Air Act and each state is responsible for
developing and implementing these operating permits.  Practices contributing
to the Department's effective program included strategic management and
fostering state and local partnerships.  

In addition, workshops involving communities and industry were held to
answer
questions and concerns regarding these permits.  Among the six states
singled
out for detailed review in the report, Florida was the only state among the
six to issue 100 percent of required permits employing a process that is, on
average, one year shorter.

"Over the last three years, the administration of Gov. Jeb Bush has made
unprecedented progress to improve Florida's air quality," said Deputy
Secretary for Regulatory Programs Allan Bedwell.  "The EPA report confirms
that our permitting process enables us to work with industry to reduce air
pollution - efficiently and effectively."

The report, entitled EPA and State Progress in Issuing Title V Permits was
produced by the EPA's Office of Inspector General.

Subject:	The Philadelphia Experiment

Jeb,

Just in case you are not already overwhelmed by the media coverage of the Philadelphia school privatization experiment, Reason Foundation weighs in with a new policy brief, "Education Management Organizatons (EMOs) Provide Choice, Competition, and Innovation," released today and written by Dr. Guilbert C. Hentschke, professor of education and management at the University of Southern California's Rossier School of Education, Scot Oschman, a Ph.D. candidate at USC's Rossier School of Education, and myself. Available at: <http://www.rppi.org/pb21.pdf>.

As David Adamany, the president of Temple University, which was assigned five schools near its North Philadelphia campus, told the Associated Press, "We're not sure we're excited yet. It will depend on the nature of the contracts."

Indeed, in many ways the success or the failure of the Philadelphia experiment hinges on the flexibility of the contracts and the degree to which the individual managers are free to implement their own business models.  In policy brief 21, we explore how EMOs represent an innovative management tool that school administrators can use to raise student achievement. We explore the unique advantages that for-profit education companies have over most school districts such as a focus on education research and development. We argue that strong school-management contracts that give EMOs maximum flexibility to implement their business models, coupled with careful contract monitoring and clear performance measures, can result in better outcomes for students.  


In addition, for more information about one of the lesser-known Philadelphia school managers, Universal Cos., see Monday's LA Times feature article below courtesy of Education Week's Daily News.

"Kenny Gamble spent the 1960s and '70s as a chart-topping songwriter and producer. Lately he's been trying to chart a new direction for his boyhood neighborhood in South Philadelphia. His Universal Cos. has built homes, developed new shops and sponsored job training. Progress has often been grudging, but the group has gained enough of a foothold to dramatically raise its sights: It is hoping to construct 2,000 homes in the next half decade. Ask Gamble to isolate the key factor in success and his answer is unequivocal: Fix the local public schools. Starting next September, Gamble's Universal Cos. will take control of two neighborhood schools. " <http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-000030518apr29.column?coll=la%2Dheadlines%2Dnation>


For more thoughtful market analysis of the Philadelphia experiment see today's Eduventures, The Education Economy, by Peter Stokes, which also has extensive coverage of the likelihood of Edison and other manager's success. See, <http://www.eduventures.com/news/education_economy/index.cfm> (access requires registration, but this is a good resource). I excerpt from today's piece below:

Good News/Bad News - Edison Wins While Losing

Edison wins 20 schools in Philadelphia, four times as many as any other provider competing for the city's schools. The bad news: Edison's stock is hovering at five dollars.

These are tricky times in education markets, and industry observers are apt to feel as though they are watching a tennis game - craning their necks first one way (the good news) and then the other (the bad news). On April 24, 2002, in their piece, "The Philadelphia Experiment: For-Profit Charter School Managers Step into the National Spotlight," Eduventures Analyst Sean Gallagher and Senior Analyst Jim McVety assess the impact of the Philadelphia School Reform Commission's recent announcement regarding the awarding of 30 out of a total of 42 schools to for-profit third-party managers, including: Edison - 20 schools, Chancellor Beacon - 5 schools, Victory Schools - 3 schools, Universal Companies - 2 schools.

The remaining schools will be managed by non-profits, including Temple University (five schools), University of Pennsylvania (three schools), and Foundations, Inc. (four schools).

"By assigning the Philadelphia schools to a variety of for-profit and non-profit providers, the Commission has created a microcosm of charter management market competition," write Gallagher and McVety. "It will provide an opportunity to examine the differing models of pedagogy and management as they operate side by side."

Gallagher and McVety note that the campaign in Philadelphia has already cost Edison substantially in terms of market cap. The long publicity war waged in the city has also undoubtedly tarnished Edison's image. As Edison's president and CEO Chris Whittle observed last October at an Eduventures event, "Other companies have competitors, we have enemies." The fact that Wall Street was expecting Edison to win as many as 45 schools has left investors with little to cheer about following the much smaller win. A recent downgrading by Merrill Lynch has resulted in a sharp sell-off of Edison's stock.

As Gallagher and McVety point out, however, the emphasis on Edison is misplaced. Something larger is at stake in Philadelphia. "The acceptance and success of for-profit managers nationwide may hinge on the quality of the results that this collective group of managers is able to deliver," they write. Ultimately, it will come down to educational performance rather than share price performance, and when it does, it will be the group of providers as a whole that will be judged.


Finally, on a less serious note, I have heard from various sources that for-profit education companies do not really like the label "Education Management Organizations."  In reality, they do not really operate like "HMOs" and they certainly do not want to share any negative connotations with HMOs. Yet, EMO is a sticky label, and it may be too late in the game to shed the label. Any thoughts on alternatives?

At Reason Foundation we are largely agnostic about which kind of choice-oriented school reform is best. We think the more competitive school-choice experiments there are the better it is for parents and children. Thanks you for your continued support of Reason's education work.

Best,

Lisa

The Legislature is in special session and the Adult Handicapped Fund is once
again under siege.  This time it doesn't appear to be the legislature's
fault, but rather, is at the request of the new VR Director, who is also in
charge of this program.  TIME IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANT.  Please send the
following message to the following people.

THE MESSAGE:

We have learned that Department of Education staff has asked that funds be
taken from the Adult Handicapped Fund in order to address deficits in the VR
and Blind Services Programs.   It is extremely unfair to adults with
disabilities that one of the programs benefiting them should be compromised
in order to benefit another.  The individuals who receive the benefits of
the Adult Basic Education provided through the Adult Handicapped Fund are
those who will likely never be able to be competitively employed, and
therefore, not able to benefit from VR services.  In Miami-Dade,
approximately 2,863 adults with disabilities are registered at 25+ agencies.
Each receives an average of 25-30 hours of educational services weekly.
While we recognize that there are many competing funding priorities, we urge
you NOT to reduce funding for the DOE's Adult Handicapped Program.

Subject:	ADULT HANDICAPPED FUND

Dear Governor Bush, 
 
We have learned that Department of Education staff has asked that funds be taken from the Adult Handicapped Fund in order to address deficits in the VR and Blind Services Programs.  It is extremely  unfair to adults with disabilities that one of the programs benefiting them should be compromised in order to benefit another.  The individuals who receive the benefits of the Adult Basic Education provided through the Adult Handicapped Fund are those who will likely never be able to be competitively employed, and therefore, not able to benefit from VR services.  In Miami-Dade, approximately 2,863 adults with disabilities are registered at 25+ agencies.  Each receives an average of 25-30 hours of educational services weekly.  While we recognize that there are many competing funding priorities, we urge you NOT to reduce funding for the DOE's Adult Handicapped Program.
 
Sincerely,

Dear Governor Bush:

Welcome back to Tallahassee! DBPR has had an exciting few weeks since you were last in town. As you begin this very important special session, we wanted to take a moment to update you on the latest activity from our agency.

We attended the prestigious ComputerWorld Honors ceremony in San Francisco. DBPR's reengineering and technical project was recognized as one of the top 75 most innovative projects of its type in the entire world! It was a monumental honor to represent the state of Florida among such a distinguished group of worldwide technology bellwethers. 

We participated in the Florida Association of Electrical Contractors spring conference in Crystal River, the Northeast Florida Builders Association trade show in Jacksonville and the Tallahassee Board of Realtors meeting. At each of these events, we demonstrated our new online services and helped licensees activate accounts and familiarize themselves with our new service channels. 

I had the great pleasure of assisting our Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco on Spring Break patrol. From March 11, 2002 - April 14, 2002, over 700,000 student visitors came to our state. Our law enforcement agents annually join forces with local law enforcement in Daytona and Panama City to combat underage drinking and false identification activity. Amazingly, we made a total of 4,284 arrests and seized over 7,500 pieces of false identification in just over 30 days. 

I was honored to be a keynote speaker at a great event in St. Petersburg, Bridging the Digital Bay 2002. This event brought together over 500 business leaders and executives from the bay area technology corridor to celebrate Florida's successes and plan for our future. Additionally, DBPR spoke with professional board groups including Employee Leasing, Geology and Cosmetology to discuss project benefits, as each of these groups will come online later this month. 

We had the great pleasure of visiting with editorial boards around the state, including the Tampa Tribune, the Florida Times-Union and the Sarasota News Herald. In fact, I have enclosed an editorial that the Tallahassee Democrat ran while you were gone. We are excited about the positive changes that are occurring at DBPR and we are seeking every available outlet to share this message.

And the message is obviously being heard because we have groups coming to tour our new Customer Contact Center on a weekly basis. Since you were last here, we have hosted the Australian Tax Office, the Florida Departments of Education, Revenue and Juvenile Justice, the Construction Industry Licensing Board and Landscape Architecture Board and representatives from the Alcoholic Beverage and Tobacco industry. 

DBPR is by far the best place to be in state government. Under your continued leadership, we are revolutionizing the way public sector businesses are run. It is our mission to reach out to as many stakeholders as possible and we need your help. If you know of events and/or groups in your districts that we should be talking with, please let us know. Call me directly at any time or contact our Office of Legislative Affairs at 850.487.4827. Good luck with the work that lies ahead of you. Please do not hesitate to call me if you need anything. 

Sincerely, 
Kim Binkley-Seyer

Floridians are benefiting from concept of e-government
By Kimberly Binkley-Seyer
SPECIAL TO THE DEMOCRAT

What comes to mind when you hear the word "Internet?" If you are like most people, you think of e-mail, Web sites and online shopping.

As a taxpayer, what should come to mind is the revolution underway within Florida's government, where the Internet is opening up more cost effective and efficient ways for public agencies to

improve the services they provide. A new era of "e-government" is living up to the potential for improving government services, shrinking paperwork, and reducing the time and effort it takes to do business with government.

The Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR) is just one example of how e-government can benefit citizens. One out of every 16 Floridians holds a license issued by DBPR. The department issues almost 200 different types of licenses for businesses and occupations, ranging from construction companies and realtors, to hotel owners and restaurateurs.

In carrying out its mission to protect consumers from unscrupulous or unqualified service providers, DBPR annually reviews millions of new license applications and renewals. This process historically forced applicants to often wait several weeks to receive a response to their mail-in application.

Despite the enormous amount of information that DBPR collects, Floridians lacked a convenient way of verifying that an accountant or re-modeler they want to hire was legitimate. The Internet and e-government provide a better way.

In a public-private partnership, DBPR has joined with Accenture, a leading provider of management and technology solutions, to move the entire professional and business licensing and renewal process online. The innovative "eLicensing" project - accessible 24 hours a day at www.myflorida.com - streamlines more than 60 databases into one integrated program. The nearly 200 licensing categories for the professions regulated by DBPR will be moved onto the centralized system over two years.

Many license categories, such as those in the real estate and construction industries, are already available. The remaining licenses will all be online in the next few months.

As these licensing categories come online, they are supported by a new customer contact center that will have more than 150 customer service representatives to serve the citizens of Florida.

Renewal and application processing times have been reduced to minutes, rather than days - and sometimes weeks. Applicants can also pay their fees with a credit card. The services are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week via secure Internet connections.

The advantages of putting this system online stretch beyond providing convenience for licensed businesses and professionals. Any resident with Internet access will soon be able to verify the validity of a license holder by searching the DBPR website by name or line of business. The site also will contain the history behind a particular license, including past complaints.

While DBPR has taken aggressive measures to protect the privacy of licensees, state law clearly directs that licensing information be made available to the public, so that consumers can protect themselves in the free marketplace. Until DBPR began using the power of the Internet, there was no real way to ensure that Floridians could get convenient access to this information.

There are further benefits to our state, such as opportunities for DBPR employees to focus their energies and talents less on paperwork and more on customer service. Along with greater opportunities to support our customers, employee skills are enhanced as they learn how to use new, innovative systems.

Perhaps most important, these improvements will yield substantive savings to Florida taxpayers. It is estimated that this e-government solution will save the state more than $90 million dollars over nine years. We are proud to be a part of Governor Bush's plan to make state government more efficient and customer friendly.

This is the way of the future - a government that is more friendly, open and responsive. We should all be proud that Florida is leading the way.

Eglin pilot declared dead after search for crashed jet in Gulf
PUBLISHED WEDNESDAY, MAY 1, 2002 - 2:55 p.m.
Louis Cooper
Pensacola News-Journal
The pilot of an Eglin Air Force Base F-15C Eagle jet fighter that crashed into the Gulf of Mexico was declared dead Wednesday after a fruitless day of searching.
U.S. Air Force Maj. James A. Duricy's jet crashed at about 9:15 a.m. Tuesday about 60 miles south of Panama City. Along with an F-16 and a KC-135, the plane was conducting a test of new air-to-air missile. The weapon was not armed.
The search was officially called off at 11:30 a.m. Wednesday. 
Duricy's age, hometown and family status were not released. He received his commission after graduating from the U.S. Air Force Academy in May 1989.
Lois Walsh, spokeswoman for the 46th Test Wing at Eglin's Air Armament Center, said personnel with Duricy's 40th Flight Test Squadron were so saddened by the loss none of the unit's planes flew Wednesday.
``You can imagine the emotions everyone is going through in that squadron,'' Walsh said. 
``I've been here 14 years, and this is the first death that I am aware of.''
The first sign of trouble in Tuesday's mission came when the F-16's pilot sent several radio transmissions to Duricy that went unanswered. That pilot soon found debris on the water's surface.
The U.S. Cost Guard led the search, coordinating efforts from its 8th District headquarters in New Orleans. The cutter Seahawk from Carrabelle spent the night searching for the wreckage and pilot, according to Petty Officer Kyle Niemi.
``The Seahawk was searching last night, and it was replaced by the Cobia (from Mobile) this morning'' along with a Falcon jet, he said. The Cobia, like the Seahawk, is an 87-foot cutter.
An investigation board has been formed to investigate the incident. An initial report is due in 30 days.

American businessman is visiting China to observe their industry and

dam.  As they are standing over the construction site, the American
businessman observes 200 workers with shovels building up the dam.  He
suggests to the Chinese officials that with a couple of steam shovels they
could get this job done at half the cost in half the time.  The Chinese
Official says, "But what would happen to all these workers?"  To that the

Miami accountability money will be included in the budget

it looks like housing money will be used to replace some of the p2000 raid

UC benefit extension will not be included in the implementing bill

HR outsourcing: KS told me that you spoke to the prez and he said they 
already spent the savings--they did.  It means that if they do not include HR 
outsourcing, they will either have to put more money in for salaries, or 
provide state employees a lower level of service than they currently get or 
would get from convergys, and they need some money for COPES. Cynthia and I 
met with Lisa Carlton and staff during regular session and told her this.  
House staff are preparing the budget with and without HR outsourcing, just in 
case.

Subject:	RE: amendment to Economic Development bill

 Governor,
Our attorney believes this amendment violates the Single Subject Act since
it is not related to economic development.  In addition, she is concerned
that the amendment weakens the academic background needed to be a licensed
general contractor.  It removes the requirement that to be a licensed
general contractor a person "shall show completion of an equal number of
courses in the appropriate field or engineering, architecture, or building
construction."  Essentially, we believe that if this amendment becomes law,
you could have a BA in art education and still be qualified to be a licensed
contractor in Florida.  

What would you like us to do?

Following our conversation about West  Miami, please remember the need for
the $750,000.00 that have been allocated for the sewer deficit. This

It is with great concern that I write this letter.  I have learned that the Department of Education has asked that funds be taken from the Adult Handicapped Fund in order to address deficits in the VR and Blind Services Programs.  It is EXTREMELY unfair to the adults with disabilities that the monies of one prof the programs benefiting those individuals should be compromised in order to benefit another program.  The individuals who receive the benefits of the Adult Basic Education provided through the Adult Handicapped Fund are those individuals who will most likely never be able to be compretitively employed.  Therefore, those individuals would not benefit from VR services.  In Miami Dade there are approximately 2,863 adults with disabilities registerer at over 25 different agencies.  Each of these agencies receives an average of 25-30 hours of educational services weekly.  I understand that there are many competing funding priorities.

I live in Pensacola and would just like to say the recent indictment of virtually our whole county commission is very upsetting to me. I follow politics extremely closely and love where your family seems to sit on the political spectrum. (the center). So I'm sure you can relate when I say I don't appreciate the federal gov't coming in and removing our elected officials with a federal grand jury. It smells of fascism and I DONT like it.
    One of the indicted commissioners is Mike Bass - I believe he was your campaign chairman for this area (or your brothers and a personal friend of mine). I realize saying anything in his behalf right now would mean taking a political hit and we need you to keep the governorship so as to help your brother keep the state in 04. But when Mr. Bass is found not guilty of the charges, I would very much like to see you personally come out in his support.

Dear Governor Bush,

Rodney suggested that I write to give you a reference on Ofelia San Pedro.  I understand that she is interested in being appointed to the Miami Dade County Commission Seat for District 12.  I couldn't give a stronger reference.

I have had the pleasure of knowing Ofelia for years as we went to high school together.  Later, we had the opportunity to work together on a Miami Museum of Science project where I was hired as the HR consultant and she serves as a Board member.

I have always known Ofelia as a person with strong ethics and high integrity.  She has a keen understanding of business, excels in increasing efficiency and engages people to work together as a team focused on a common goal.  Without a doubt, she would be an asset to a location that unfortunately has been impacted with far too many situations involving those who have chosen to demonstrate inappropriate behavior.

Governor, I hope you consider her for this important position.  She would bring the professionalism and integrity that is sorely needed.

Thank you for your time.

Hi Berthy,  I got your message asking for details on our budget and how
we are faring.  Here is the breakdown.  All of our budget requests were
matched by the Governor, House and Senate with the exception of the
Clearinghouse (CH) on Disability Information.

CH - House: Item #422 = 1 FTE included in a total allocation of $123,158
CH - Senate: Item #741 = 1 FTE included in total allocation of $234,817
CH - Governor = 1 FTE and expenses totaling $250,000

The FTE with salaries and benefits costs $48,372.

The House allocation is insufficient to maintain the program and continue
in implementation efforts.  The CH also serves as the fiscal base for the
grant.  We are providing in-kind services but the House proposal will
only pay for rent, phones, and maintenance of server and the 1 position. 
No printing, marketing, web site deployment, software purchases,
implementation of multiple languages and more could be funded.

The DMS plan is that we believe the Senate will feel strongly about the
CH and would ask for their proposal to be matched.  The $234,817 can be
made sufficient with the elimination of a few expenses, if necessary. 
The issue is headed to Conference Committee.  Our challenge (DMS) is to
keep it on the radar screen because it is such a small issue compared to
other items and various strategies between the House and Senate.

There is one stop, however, that I would strongly urge you to make during this month.
You have been invited to speak at Pow Wow in New Orleans on May 29th by our Florida Tourism Commission Chair, Fred Lounsberry.
What a tremendous opportunity for the hospitality industry of Florida to  have the benefit of your presence addressing the many international tourism representatives attending Pow Wow !  This meeeting is attended by the largest product development directors, vice-presidents and presidents from around the world.  Decision makers who will certainly affect our international tourism business. 
 No one can sell us the way you can, and the international aspect of our recovery needs the best sales pitch we've got.  
Most of the Convention and Visitors Bureaus from around the State will be represented at Pow Wow.  Please join us for this major event.

We have learned that Department of Education staff has asked that funds be

disabilities that one of the programs benefiting them should be compromised
in order to benefit another.  The individuals who receive the benefits of

Dear Gov. Bush

I realize that budgeting items are some of the most difficult for the Legislature to make.  However, I am highly concerned about the potential of Adult Handicapped Funds being cut.  I become most concerned when funds for some of Floridas most vulnerable citizens are being viewed as areas to potentially "...rob Peter to pay Paul."  Many of the individuals who would be most hurt from these cuts are citizens who cannot advocate for themselves, are in critical need of meaningful programs and who do not have the opportunities to have a fulfilled life without programs that use the Adult Handicapped Funds. 

Thus I hope there will be tremendous consideration given to not cutting the Adult Handicapped Funds.

Thanks, Pam. 

VISIT FLORIDA's in-state campaign kicked in this week so you'll be seeing
and hearing a lot of FLA USA through June. This is in addition to the
ongoing recovery co-op programs funded by the $20 million economic stimulus
budget.

As you may be aware, we've filmed two additional TV commercials for the
in-state campaign. One features Derrick Brooks and John Lynch of the Tampa
Bay Buccaneers and the other features NASCAR driver Mark Martin. Both are in
editing now and these two commercials will soon be added to the rotation
that includes Jennifer Capriati. On the radio side, Andy Garcia will be
included in both English (and Spanish) along with Coach Bowden. 

African American and Hispanic programs are in place to supplement our reach
to these important audiences beyond our general market efforts. These
programs include television, radio and newspaper.
 
In our negotiations with the media, we requested a commitment for a 1:1
match of "bonus" spots resulting in one extra commercial for every paid
spot. In order to receive these bonus spots, the media required us to
provide public service announcements rather than running our celebrity
creative as bonus. So we've produced fresh, new PSAs for both radio and TV.

Outdoor boards are also part of the in-state program. And, of course, the
radio spots featuring the Governor are running now out of state.

We'll continue sending you samples of the new work as it's completed. 

We appreciate your assistance and that of the Governor's Office of External
Affairs in lining up the celebrities.

Hey, Pamarino!

I heard the Bobby Bowden commercial about the "Florida Vacation" game plan
today.  It reminded of me of you.  Just wanted to say hi --- and to tell you
I think the commercial is very good.

Dear Shannon,

	Thank you again for writing to Governor Bush.  As I mentioned in an
earlier email to you, I have taken some time to look into the issues you
mentioned in your correspondence.  This includes visiting with DARE
officials, a meeting with the Florida Board overseeing drug prevention
efforts in Florida, discussions and phone calls with coalition leaders, law
enforcement officials, students, and others.  

	You have raised a number of valid questions.  The officer who talked
to your daughter and her class, although not identified in your email, may
have inadvertently given ideas for drug abuse while trying to warn of the
dangers of them.  If you will tell me which school on which date, I will ask
that the lesson plan be reviewed.

	I have enclosed below a response I received from DARE that both
mentions the criticisms of DARE and their response to it.  The statement
that they are moving to scientifically proven methods of prevention is
correct.  I have verified that through other sources, to include discussions
with some of the leading scientists in this field.  I also know some of the
institutions they have partnered with, and they are among the most respected
in the nation.  I also traveled to Miami to meet with the incoming Director
for the Southeastern United States.  He is superb and I believe will bring a
great deal of effectiveness to his position.

	Aside from all of that, let me just share with you some of the
comments I heard from other parents, school officials, treatment providers,
prevention specialists, and law enforcement experts.  I will try to condense
them, but the themes were well developed and repeated across the spectrum by
a number of them.  Their flow goes something like this.

		DARE in the beginning may not have been steeped in the
science of prevention, but the field itself was undeveloped until very
recently.  Nor can we substantiate those things that did not happen (i.e.,
how many children were prevented from using drugs by the program) in the
past years.  But DARE came along at a time when no one else was attempting
to explain to children the problems of drug abuse.  Certainly the limited
exposure to a DARE class was not enough in itself to ensure a lifetime of
protection, but the dearth of other efforts does not diminish, thereof, the
importance of at least one message being given.  

		Moreover, DARE was and remains a critical link in the
connection between law enforcement and prevention.  In recent years, law
enforcement officials have come to appreciate how important the entire
integration of law enforcement, prevention, and treatment is.  DARE provides
one element of that connectivity, and to separate it would be a step back in
our overall approach to drug control.

		Finially, with the institution of best practices, which DARE
is now undertaking, with a great deal of effort invested in evaluation of
the effectiveness of the program, we can expect to see a vital system at
work.  In instances where there is little else to cover this need (and rural
areas was often cited as an example) and where the family does not reinforce
(indeed sometimes send a contrary message) the view that drug abuse is
harmful, DARE education becomes even more important.

		You apparantly have done an excellent job in raising your
6th grade child to be aware of the dangers of drugs.  Congratulations on
having done that.  Other families, however, are not so diligent.  DARE has
probably helped them in the past, and with their new methods of instruction,
shoulld be helpful in the future.

		Again, thank you for writing.  


	
Sincerely,


	
Jim McDonough

Jeb- We understand the latest proposal from Senator Latvala is to have
the CFO have final okay who you appoint as the regulator of the banking
division.  If in fact that is true, we oppose such a proposal. 

We rather have the Governor and Cabinet by majority vote select the
banking regulator and to be confirmed by the Senate. Why should the CFO
have final decision who the banking regulator is when even the Senate
plan does not have the banking regulator reporting to the CFO?

It makes no sense, and only politicizes the office of the CFO and opens
up the possibility of returning to those days where the Comptroller and
his cronies forced political contributions from the banking industry.

Jeb's One Florida Program Is A Winner For Minorities

Published: May 2, 2002 
T he hard numbers continue to show that despite all protests, Gov. Jeb
Bush's One Florida plan is notably helping minorities. 
The governor took a lot of grief when he abruptly adopted the plan to
eliminate racial quotas. The move was aimed at defusing a referendum
campaign to eliminate affirmative action, which would have greatly
restricted the state's ability to aid minorities. 
So the governor adopted a plan that guarantees the top 20 percent of
students in every high school senior class are accepted into a state
university if those students have taken preparatory classes. 
The plan also eliminated set-aside hiring of minority contractors by
agencies that report to the governor. Instead, the governor gave a clear
directive to the agencies: Minority businesses should be hired when
possible, records will be kept on minority hiring and agency heads will be
held accountable for the department's performance. 
For his good efforts, the governor was accused of abandoning minorities. Two
lawmakers protested in his office. Opponents still depict him as
unsympathetic to minorities. 
This is simply not true. The governor is committed to diversity, as his
appointments and policies show. If he made a mistake with One Florida, it
was rushing ahead without waiting to build support. 
One Florida was designed to help minorities. Statistics show it is working.
Consider how it has affected state contracts: 
Since One Florida was adopted, state spending with certified minority
businesses has more than doubled and most of that increase has come in the
governor's agencies. These departments, which fall under his One Florida
rule, have nearly tripled their annual certified minority spending, compared
to that of the prior administration. 
In fiscal year 1998-1999, the governor's agencies spent $151 million with
minority businesses. By 2000-2001, that figure had increased 160 percent to
$392 million. And the figure is on track to be even higher this fiscal year.

The state also has increased spending on nonprofit organizations that
benefit minority populations. 
As we've reported before, One Florida has not hurt minority enrollment in
the state university system. This year 1,250 more minority students entered
the systems than the year before One Florida took effect. And minority
enrollment continues to be about 36 percent of the entering classes. 
Clearly, One Florida has not resulted in the resegregation of the state
university system, as some critics claimed it would. 
It certainly appears the governor has developed an intelligent, quota-free
way to aid minorities, and perhaps it's time to clear Gov. Bush of the
charge - the lie - that he is indifferent to the plight of minorities.

See below, a letter from George Koehn to me regarding EFI's request to scale
down their performance measurements required under OTTED contract.  I do not
want to water down their performance standards to a point which doesn't
challenge them...however, I am okay to find a suitable middle ground of
measurement.  I am not sure who told George that OTTED refused to adjust
standards as it is not true and I will let him know this.  I can always
excuse their not meeting measurements as it is my discretion as director.
My main wish is for EFI to set challenging goals and then do what they can
to meet them.  If they can not, then I will evaluate whether their not
meeting them was justifyable.

On a side, the real hurdle for EFI on performance measurements is the Senate
and House staff who have voiced discontent w/ reducing measurements.

I work with the Miami-Dade government.  I believe with her knowledge of procurement issues, she would be a tremendous asset.  Further and most importantly, I know that she would represent the Governor with honor and integrity.  He would be proud of the appointment.

Subject:	Adults with Disabilities Funding

We have learned that Department of Education staff has asked that funds
be taken from the Adult Handicapped Fund in order to address deficits in
the VR and Blind Services Programs.   It is extremely unfair to adults
with disabilities that one of the programs benefiting them should be
compromised in order to benefit another.  The individuals who receive
the benefits of the Adult Basic Education provided through the Adult
Handicapped Fund are those who will likely never be able to be
competitively employed, and therefore, not able to benefit from VR
services.  In Miami-Dade, approximately 2,863 adults with disabilities
are registered at 25+ agencies.  Each receives an average of 25-30 hours
of educational services weekly.  While we recognize that there are many
competing funding priorities, we urge you NOT to reduce funding for the
DOE's Adult Handicapped Program.

In Brevard County over 329 students are being served daily and trying improve the quality of their lives.   The ABE program instruction advances their skills of self-determination and vastly improves the quality of their lives.  Besides, this is their right as citizens of this state!

In addition, individuals with disabilities must have a place to enhance skills for the rest of their lives and to prepare for supported employment before going to VR for services.  

It is inexplicable why this population's rights must continuously be the subject of the financial climate of the times and constantly be put at risk.  

Brevard County, as a result of the performance-based funding approach started two years ago, is making great strides toward improving and enhancing the self-determination of our ABE clients.  

Thank you.

The Everglades bill has been transmitted to you; obviously we hope you will soon sign this important legislation.

In response to some of the concerns raised by others about the "standing" amendment put on this bill by Sen. King, I have prepared the attached two page analysis (MS word format) which I think is helpful in explaining the actual limited nature of the changes to "standing" caused by the amendment to this bill. 

As I have said previously, I think that the angst caused to some by this amendment is best answered by an approach which says "we will carefully monitor its impact and advocate any corrective changes found necessary".

Subject:	FPL  Power Plant, Parrish, FL

Governor Bush

It is time to require the FPL plant located in Manatee County to install an
SCR
emission control system. The plant has operated for about 30 years as a high
load auxiliary supply facility. As such, it has historically operated at
relatively
low average percentage of peak output capacity. That has changed and the use
of the plant has increased enough to increase pollution by 20%. There is no
good reason to allow any increase in pollution when there is an effective
and
economic method to control/reduce emissions such as SCR. Also, now that
natural gas will be available to that plant it should be the required fuel
for at
least 60% of the produced power regardless of demand levels or fuel costs.

Many of us in Manatee County gave our time, expertise and money to defeat
Orimulsion. We believe that the next step must be taken: Require FPL to meet
stricter emission control standards.

Respectfully;

Paul Sayers

Dear Gov. Bush,
 
It was good to see you in Jacksonville recently.  I am excited to see your interest in early childhood initiatives.  There are a couple of things I want to bring to your attention just in case no one else has.
 
First, you may remember the discussion about the very good tape that David Lawrence has made for parents regarding the development of their children.  It really is excellent, however I was a little concerned to see that former Gov. Lawton Chiles and the present mayor of Miami were given all the credit for the work being done in early childhood.  If he is giving it away to all the PBS stations, I would feel better if he would either add you to the credits or take that segment out of the tape.  It may be a small thing, but it could influence many voting parents.
 
Second, the surprised look on your face when I mentioned the effect of removing 4 year olds from the private and faith-based sector would have on infant/toddler care, told me that no one has explained the bigger picture to you.  Butch Cronon and I have been trying to explain this to the partnership board for the last couple of months.  The child care infrastructure is very fragile.  Parents simply cannot afford the true cost of care.  Butch opened his infant room back up recently and had to charge parents over $200 per week to cover the cost of that room.  If more money is designated to 4 year old pre-k without careful consideration of financial cause and effect on the 70 to 80% of private centers, it could cause great harm.
 
If you receive the $41million from the legislature you are asking for, please do not give it to the Partnership Board to decide how to spend without first letting Butch and I explain our concerns to you more fully.  I realize you are very busy, but this is truly important and I would appreciate your consideration of my request.  Thank you again for giving me a chance to make a difference for young children and for inclusion of our faith and values in what we teach.
 
Sincerely,
Ellen McKinley
 
PS  I will let you know by the end of May how the Jacksonville model is working out.  If it is accepted, it will be the first time I know of that a consortium of providers from the public schools, Head Start, the university system, central agencies, and faith-based have worked together.

Governor,

According to their city charter rules the city commission has 10 days in
which to find a replacement for Dr. Billings. If they fail to fill the
vacancy within the 10 days...you are then empowered to fill it.  We have
been in contact with Jim English the city attorney and they are calling a
special meeting next week to discuss a plan to fill the vacancy. I will
contact Mike.  eli

Glad  to assist always, Governor! However, no cigar until Senate approves the "piggyback " bill!. Between statistics and input-output models, we sure are having fun! Seriouly, if some other States abandon mirroing federal tax code becuse of this positive stimulus, we should agressively go after their capital intensive and other businesses for relocation to Florida.

Dear Governor Bush (Jeb):

I know that your schedule exhausting. Still, I would like to prevail upon
you on behalf of South Florida's international
trade community, represented by the World Trade Center Miami. You have made
an enormous contribution to our 
region's economic vitality by actively supporting international trade. Your
leadership has made, and will continue to 
make, a significant and positive difference well into the future. 

As the incoming chairman of the World Trade Center Miami, I would like to
stress the importance of your accepting
the International Achievement Award in June of this year. It would also
provide an effective forum to showcase your
accomplishments in this sector to the benefit of the entire state. TPA and
FTAA are stated WTCM priorities that 
will benefit our nation as whole. We sincerely believe that you can lead the
State of Florida to the forefront of these
important issues. 

Please confirm a date as soon as possible so that we may begin to organize a
successful, impactful and transcendent
event. 

Cordially, 
Ana Maria

Dear Governor Bush,

As you know, Unison Industries in Jacksonville is a key supplier on the
F119/F135 engine powering the U.S. Air Force's new air dominance fighters,
the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.  I know that you are aware of
the importance of both of these weapons programs in maintaining US defense
presence worldwide, as well as providing high value jobs and advanced
technology to our defense industry.

Unison will be hosting a visit from the Showcase of Power on Friday here in
our Jacksonville facility on May 3.  The Showcase of Power, sponsored by
engine maker Pratt & Whitney, is a mobile exhibit intended to educate the
public on the importance of the F-22 and F-35 JSF engine programs in support
of American technology, jobs and freedom.  The exhibit features a
surround-sound theater so visitors can experience the thrill of flight, and
a full-size engine model with system maintainability and sustainability
demonstrations.  It is all housed in a 75' long tractor trailer truck.  I
saw this exhibit at our facility in Fort Worth and it is an impressive
sight.

I am hopeful that you can join all of our employees at our facility on May 3
at 11:00 AM to learn more about these critical propulsion systems.  We look
forward to a fun and informative event.

Brian Wenzel

Dear Child Advocate: 

The complicated circumstances surrounding the Rilya Wilson case are changing by the hour. The Kansas City police could not verify the identity of the body found last April based on the insufficient palm prints sent from Miami, so DNA testing is now planned. We've learned that over the past 15-months, the missing Miami 5-year-old was not cared for by a grandmother, but a godmother.  Miami dependency court authorities, the state attorney, police, and the Department of Children & Families are all launching full investigations into the case history and possible whereabouts of the child. By the time you read this note, we're certain a cascade of other information will have poured forth.

This morning's inaugural meeting of the House Select Committee on Oversight of the Department of Children & Families - a short 45-minute orientation session - barely addressed the Wilson case or the growing crisis in protection of children. Committee Chair Sandra Murman announced a second more intensive hearing for next Thursday, May 9th, during which testimony will be accepted. Upon adjournment today, however, the media surged to interview Secretary Kate Kearney and others who have responsibilities in the Rilya Wilson case. To her credit, Secretary Kearney is accepting a full measure of responsibility for the inadequate case neglect, and has pledged a thorough review of the cases of all children in protective custody.

The sense of tension over the fate of Rilya is intensified by the feeling that there may be hundreds, if not thousands, of other children in our child protection system who are not being properly supervised, not receiving the services they need, and may be in some danger. This is a crisis of confidence which must be recognized and corrected.  New laws will not solve the problem. Like a cookbook without groceries, laws without resources are ineffective. 

The media is a hungry beast. Its appetite is voracious, especially when a case unfolds with the intrigue and intensity of this one. It is our job as advocates is to put faces on the facts, and put the facts in context of real need. Our intent is to leverage the circumstances of today's outrage into policy and program improvements.

The invitations are pouring in. I am appearing on the O'Reilly Factor tonight, Thursday, which broadcasts on FOX NEWS at 8:00 PM Eastern and repeats at 11:00PM. Calls for interviews are being received from across the nation and several from Europe! We are honored to be asked to translate today's crisis into words which inform and inspire action.

Having your support and feedback is vital and valued.....Feel free to forward our Advocate Alerts to your network. Please keep us posted.....we'll do the same......

was a wise decision as I was viewed as too conservative by Deputy Secretary
Bose, and it would have been uncomfortable for both of us.  I deeply
appreciate your assistance and efforts in my behalf.

I have some time now and I hope that I can be of assistance to you in your
campaign.  

I am finishing a paper for City University of New York on Mayor Giuliani's
welfare reform initiatives.  I spent time in the city meeting with welfare
officials and have a draft of the first part of the report.  I am attaching
it to this email as I believe the Mayor did some things that were unique and
may represent things that your Workforce and Technical Skills folks should
examine. 

I am working on a second part of the New York story that addresses
initiatives he took to stem welfare fraud.  These too were unique and unlike
anything I saw in the my time as welfare reform director for Governor
Martinez or as Secretary in South Carolina.  I will pass that along to you
also when it is complete.

Judge Kearny was on the tube today defending her department against
accusations of failing to protect children.  I had lunch with her and two of
her deputies two years ago and gave her some suggestions on things she might
do to address the child protection issue.  I believe she has taken action on
many of the issues that I suggested.

The issue of confidentiality (today's featured subject) is one that I had to
address in South Carolina.  I worked with the General Assembly to alter the
law in a manner that allowed me to discuss issues with more freedom.  After
passage, I was allowed to discuss issues that were known by virtue of being
reported in the press, to answer allegations made by persons accused of
abuse and to meet behind closed doors with members who wanted more knowledge
of a particular case.  Another initiative that I started was to initiate a
high level committee of department lawyers, advocates and others to discuss
each case of a child who died or dissapeared to ascertain if there was a
need for training, legislation, or personnel actions.  This helped the cases
"stay alive" and also allowed the training staff to use case history for
case oriented training.

You can never win these issues by attempting to shield yourself behind a
need to keep information confidential or by denying the seriousness of the
issue.  The public wants someone to pay for any harm that comes to an abused
child and when government officials appear to concealing information or not
recognizing the horror of an act it often becomes time for falling on
swords.  If you want a copy of the five pages of suggestions that I gave the
judge let me know. 

If you will put me in touch with your Campaign Director I will meet with
them to see how I might be my time to use in your behalf.  Thank you again
for all of your assistance and kindness.

Highly recommend a dear friend who was a former navy captain who retired
after 27 years of service in the Navy.  Bill Dickson was born in Escambia
County and still resides there.  He flew over 250 missions off the USS
Nimitz, Enterprise and Kitty Hawk as a squadron commander in Veitnam.  After
Vietnam he became the CO of the Naval Aviation School Command and after that
he became the CO of the Pensacola Naval Air Station.

I know Bill from his post-Navy career at Sacred Heart Hospital in Pensacola.

Thank you for your response to my e-letter, in which I expressed concern
about the way in which the INS handled what I think was a questionable
entry into this country by a Russian family.  (The response was signed by
Armando Vilaboy.)  I only have one question.  

Mr. Vilaboy's letter told me to contact the local INS enforcement office,
and gave a phone number.  In my original e-mail, I mentioned no names,
but said that I would gladly furnish that information should you share my
concern.  Is there a particular INS enforcement officer that I should
contact?  Would there be someone there who would know of the suspicions
that I wrote about in contacting you?  I am asking because I do not want
to have to unnecessarily call them up blindly.

BTW, the phone number given to me, in Mr. Vilaboy's letter, for your
local office, is no longer in service.

Subject: re: school interview


Hello Governor Bush,
Thank you very much for agreeing to do this interview. Here is a list of questions that I had prepared about issues facing students as well as your experiences.

-Why do you think that it is important to support the Florida Virtual School? IT HAS THE POTENTIAL OF HELPING TO REDEFINE EDUCATION. IT IS STUDENT CENTERED AND CAN BE USED IN SO MANY WAYS .... REMEDIATION, HONORS/AP CLASSES FOR STUDENTS WHO CAN'T ACCESS THEM, ETC.

-Do you foresee other schools of a similar design popping up around the country? YES BUT IN OUR STATE IT IS MY HOPE THAT WE DON'T TRY TO REINVENT THE WHEEL AND CONTINUE TO SUPPORT FLORIDA VIRTUAL SCHOOL.

-Do you think that online learning would have been beneficial when you were growing up or perhaps would have benefited your children? GOSH, I AM SO OLD I CAN REMEMBER BLACK AND WHITE TELEVISIONS! ON LINE LEARNING WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO ME.

-Do you think that the Virtual School will be able to issue diplomas to its students in the near future? I HOPE SO.

-Many critics argue that FLVS is not an effective educational medium because of the lack of interaction among students and faculty. However, AP (Advanced Placement) scores among Virtual School students exceed the national average by nearly nine percent. What is your comment about this apparent contradiction? THE VIRTUAL SCHOOL IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. BUT IT IS A GOOD MEANS TO ACCELERATE LEARNING FOR KIDS THAT DON'T NEED AS MUCH ATTENTION.

-There has been a considerable amount of media coverage on the recent cell phone controversies facing school districts across America. Some believe that students should be allowed to keep these devices on campus as long as they are not turned on, whereas others protest that such technologies would serve as nothing but a distraction. Where do you stand and why? I HAVE NOT FOLLOWED THE ISSUE BUT NOW i WILL!

-The SWAT (Students Working Against Tobacco) program, which was founded under the Chiles administration, received a considerable budget cut in October, with a large portion of that money being redistributed to enhance road development. Do you think that it will be important to restore the funds for this program? THE TOBACCO PROGRAM IS DOING FINE. WE ARE SPENDING $39 MILLION DOLLARS. THAT WAS WHAT IS BEING SPENT LAST YEAR. THAT IS A LOT OF DOUGH!

-If funding is not able to be replaced, what are some of the initiatives that can be taken to continue efforts to decrease youth smoking? TEEN SMOKING IS DOWN IN OUR STATE WHICH IS A GOOD THING.

-Due to increased security after September 11, do you think that there has been a decrease in youth involvement in the government, such as the TeenPact program for Christian homeschoolers or the senate page program, in which Stephen York, a Florida Virtual School student, participates? I HAVE NOT NOTICED A DECLINE IN YOUTH INVOLVEMENT. IN FACT, I THINK THERE HAS BEEN MORE CIVIC INVOLVEMENT THAN BEFORE THAT I HOPE CAN BE SUSTAINED.

-I am sure that you are aware of the teacher shortage facing the state of Florida. What would you say to high schoolers or college students to encourage them to pursue a career in the field of education? THE LAWS OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND APPLY TO THE TEACHING PROFESSION. THERE WILL BE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES IN TEACHING IN THE NEXT DECADE. TEACHING IS A VERY NOBLE PROFESSION!

-What factors influenced your decision to attend the college that you did? I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL IN THE NORTHEAST US AND WANTED TO GO BACK HOME SO I ATTENDED THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS. 

-What is something that you now know that you wish you would have known while in school? I KNOW NOW NOT TO BE IN QUITE THE RUSH I WAS IN BACK THEN. I GRADUATED IN 2.5 YEARS.

-Your mother seems to be a pretty amazing woman. What is the most important piece of advice that she gave you, and have you shared this with your own children? LOVE MY WIFE AND CHILDREN MORE THAN LIFE ITSELF. THAT IS EASY TO DO!

-What advice would you give to the siblings of particularly high achievers? WORK HARD.

-Growing up in a political family, when did you decide that this would be the area that you would go into? What other fields had you considered? I FIRST GOT INVOLVED IN POLITICS TO HELP MY DAD WHO I TRULY LOVE. I OVERCAME MY FEARS OF SPEAKING IN PUBLIC AND BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND THE JOYS OF SERVICE BY WATCHING MY DAD IN HIS PUBLIC SERVICE. IN 1993 I DECIDED TO MAKE THE LEAP. I HAD BEEN IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR UNTIL THEN.

-Has it been difficult to maintain your own identity instead of just being one of “the Bush boys?” I STOPPED WORRYING ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE THINK A WHILE BACK AND NOW FOCUS ON HOW I CAN SERVE AND HELP OTHERS.

-Integrity is an important quality for all of humanity, but especially those who have achieved celebrity status as political figures. What suggestions do you have for the next generation of voters who are exposed to negative campaigning and apparent lack of morality on the part of some elected officials? SAY WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO AND DO WHAT YOU SAID YOU WOULD DO. DON'T VEER FROM PRINCIPLE. BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF. SHOW HUMILITY. FIGHT HARD BUT FIGHT FAIR.

-What do you think of such government based shows as NBC’S “The West Wing?” Do you feel that these give an accurate portrayal of political life? I DON'T WATCH WEST WING.

-What is one of your stronger contributions that you would like to see communicated, but that you fear may be overshadowed by other platforms in the upcoming campaign? MOVING OUR STATE TOWARDS RISING STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT BEING THE MISSION AND CALLING OF ALL FLORIDIANS. 


Once again, I wanted to thank you very much for your time. I am also a student writer for the St. Petersburg Times and would like to run some of your comments as a follow-up to some of the other articles that I had written.

Thank you,
Autumn Siegel

RE:  Database designed to track drug use (May 2, 2002)
 
  I gladly support the state of Florida, Gov. Jeb Bush and James McDonough in supporting efforts to a database tracking system regarding drug use. Drugs such as OxyContin, Codeine, Morphine and other opiates are highly addictive and have the potential to destroy lives. Their intended purpose is to relieve pain.  Unfortunately, drug abuse and addiction is a very serious problem in our country today.  We need to examine new ways to deal with this ever growing problem.  This database would be closed to the public.  The goal is to assist law enforcement agencies, doctors and Department of Health employees in making sure people aren't abusing legal drugs.  This protects patients and the doctors and creates a win-win for both.  
I pray for our leaders in government to use their talents, titles and positions to benefit the welfare of our nation. By working together, the stepping stones are being laid in a way that touches us all, directly or indirectly.

Jim,
 
   Hello.  I hope you are doing well.
 
I read in today's St.Petersburg Times, (Thursday, May 2, 2002) the front page article in regards to the database that would monitor drug use.  (Prior to Jennifer's latest detox in February at PAR) 
Jennifer had been receiving methadone (pill form)  by a local pain management doctor.  This alarmed me greatly that a patient can walk into a doctor's office and walk out with a prescription for the highly addictive drug methadone.  Addicts love doctors like this. This doctor needs to be monitored who he is giving methadone to.  Here is the doctor's name Jennifer went to and received methadone.
 
Mark Kantzler, DO.,  PA
5318  Duhme Road
Maderia Florida  33708
Phone: (727) 398-3011
 
Currently, Jennifer is on daily methadone at PAR by Dr. Benson. Jennifer told me her dosage had to be increased last week from 65 mg. to 68 mg. per day.  She was going into symptoms of withdrawal
(uncomfortable, sweating, etc.).  She said her body gets used to the dose and then requires more.
There must be some other answer to Jennifer's opiate addiction.
 
 I continue praying daily for Jennifer and asking God's help and intervention.  My grandson, Trey, needs his mother to be healthy and sober. I do not have all the answers to all the complexities of Jennifer's addiction. 
 
This I do know:  An addict can refuse drug treatment for their drug addiction.  Families can do nothing but watch the addiction progress.  There is The Marchman Act.  It's good for a 72 hour window of assessment / observation.  That's as good as it gets. That is why I wrote the Jennifer Act. 
 
I support the plan to track doctors who prescribe methadone and all opiates, including OxyContin, morphine and codeine. 
 
Sincerely,

Subject:	Re: New Orleans Pow Wow fup

FYI

Basically it is this - as you know, Thom Stork was employed by SeaWorld
until last January/February.  Since then he has become the Director of the
Florida Aquarium in Tampa.  Thus, because he will be residing in Tampa he is
no longer eligible to sit on the commission representing the Orlando region.
Instead, in order to be on the commission he must fill a seat in my region.

The only seat beoming available is the one I am currently in and it is open
as of June 30th.  I understand that I have the option to apply for
reappointment.  I also understand from Austin Mott that Thom Stork plans to
apply for my seat.    So, I have decided that if you feel  it would better
suit the needs of the commission and Florida for Thom to take this seat then
I am prepared to astep aside.

You should know that my preference is to stay in my current position.
However, I serve at your pleasure and for the State and I will support any
decision you make.   Austin has indicated  he is waiting for me to advise
him if I plan to reapply or not.  I told him I would let him know in due
time.

I have taken enough of your time tonight.

Thanks,

Tom

Ms. Wright, I have no clue who is providing you with information but let me set the record straight.

I have never said teachers are doing a lousy job. I fully understand the challenges you face which is why we continue to increase funding for programs like the national board certification for teachers (we are approaching the number state in the country).

Funding is higher today than it was prior to me being governor. For the upcoming budget year, we will see close to a 9% increase, which is equal to 6% per student and over $1 billion. For the four years, the total increase will be 27% and over $3 billion. These increases are greater than my predecessor's first or second term. Taking into consideration student population growth and inflation, the numbers are higher than before. 

We are not in the bottom five states in terms of per student funding and that funding is increasing.

Finally, the corporate tax issue is not a tax cut but a tax deferral which only will come into play if a business invests which will increase the chance of job creation. The money will come back to government. 

Thanks for allowing me to correct the record. I appreciate your writing.

Jeb Bush

Dear Governor Bush,
262 million     tax savings for corporations.  Yes, by all means, let's give
Big Business more money.  
It's a pity that money couldn't go into education, creating more teaching
jobs to help get funding back to where it was before you became governor.  I
am a teacher in a Title 1 school - I've been here for 28 years and I'm not
going anywhere - but if I was just starting out I sure wouldn't go into
teaching.  Last year you said Teachers in the state of Florida are doing a
lousy job.  Well, I think we perform miracles every day - and we will
continue to - but the more children in each class, the harder it will be to
give each and every child the attention he needs.  Studies have shown time
and time again that class size has a huge effect on achievement. That's
tried and true.  You see, the more children you put in a class, the less
time a teacher has to work induvidually with those children who are in
danger of being left behind. 
Education funding in Florida is in the bottom 5 states on money spent per
student. I can't imagine how anyone could give himself the title "Education
Governor" & spend so little on education!! Seems to me that title should be
earned.  

How will this tax cut help in the overall plan - "No child left behind?"

Sincerely,
Cathy S. Wright

Leah:  
 
Thanks for the information.  I am not very familiar with the adult handicapped fund. Based on the e-mail information and some familiarity with the programs, I am not sure that you will agree with me, but as usual, I must be honest.  
 
To begin, I do not agree with the attitude reflected in statement that reads "those 22 and older transitioning to adult day programs".  Instead, the attitude should for VR and the school system to facilitate and encourage for "those over 22 and older should" transitio to employment and other integrated community alternatives.  The reality is that specially with students that have significant disabilities, the schools and VR continue to emphasize adult day training programs as opposed to employment or other integrated alternatives, during transitioning IE PLANS & meetings. This perpetuates segregation, isolation, and dependency.   People with disabilities will never have equality, unless the system gives then the opportunity.  
 
That attitude, and the paradigm needs to change.  We need to work in changing the system to one that believes that even people with most significant disabilities can be employable, if they have the proper support, services, education and encouragement.

Hi Pat,
 
Would appreciate your sending this email to  Jeanne at Deerfield Beach High
School and anyone else who may have connections in advocating for state
dollars for adults with disabilities. ( If the state decides to eliminate the
funding or take 14 million off the 18 million pot, there would be barely any
$$ in Broward to provide services to adults in day training programs or
off-campus programs to those 22 and older transitioning to adult day programs
like Goodwill, Lucanus or the off-campus programs  that support those who are
on the Medicaid waiver in agencies and those are the waiting list in our
off-campus programs or those whom VR does not make eligible for services.  We
have had a  waiting list for months in our day programs as well.    Time is of
the essence.
 
The Legislature is in a special session and the Adult Handicapped Fund is once
again under siege.  This time it appears that the Governor wants to take the 
Adult Handicapped  Funds in order to address deficits in the VR and Blind
Services Programs. (VR needs to get a state match of federal funds so they
want to attach these funds to VR instead of the school systems throughout the
state.)    
It is extremely unfair to adults with disabilities that one of the programs
benefiting them should be compromised in order to benefit another.  The
individuals who receive the benefits of the Adults with Disabilities Funds are
those who likely never will be able to be competitively employed and
therefore, not be able to benefit from VR Services.  In Broward County alone ,
approximately 1300 adults with disabilities are registered at 18 agencies. 
Each receives an average of 25-30 hours of educational services weekly.  While
there are many competitive funding opportunities, we urge you not to reduce
funding for the DOE's Adult Handicapped Program-

It has been called to my attention that our state stands to lose $400 million over the next three years due to the possible linking of state law with the tax break in the federal "2002 Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act."  It also appears that you can stop this from happening by "decoupling" state law from the federal law.  In the early 1980s, responding to a similar federal change, some 21 states (including Florida) decoupled from federal depreciation rules. Please do it again.

Dear Governor Bush:

I need your help.  Since the start of this year, the World Trade Center
Miami has been trying to "lock-down" a date for this prestigious dinner
at
which time the World Trade Center Miami will present you with the
International Achievement Award.  Concurrent to this, my company, Miami
Business Magazine (now South FloridaCEO) and LatinCEO magazine, would
very
much like to place you on the cover of the month in which you receive
the
award.  Our circulation for South FloridaCEO is 50,000 in Miami-Dade,
Broward and the Palm Beaches.  It is comprised of Chairman, CEOs,
Presidents
and Chief Operating Officers.  Primarily the leaders of this thriving
community.  Furthermore, community leaders such as Ed Easton (my partner
and
co-owner of the magazines) has agreed to be a sponsor of the dinner as
the
event is good for the community, the region and, of course, for our
Governor's international efforts.

I am able to place you on our July issue which will be released during
the
last two weeks of June.  Actually--this could be quite beneficial to the
State as our focus will be on UK investment into the Americas through
Florida.  This is a joint effort project with H.M. Consul Simon Davey of
the
British Consulate and Trade Partners UK and coordinates well with your
upcoming mission to Great Britain.

Can you please make this decision a priority?  Once again, the date
should
be late June with a preference for a Wednesday of Thursday evening.

All the best.

Dear Mr. Widmann,

Governor Bush appreciates hearing from you about Medicaid's reimbursement
methodology and asked us to respond.

Medicaid respects your concerns regarding its wheelchair payment policy. In
the coming weeks, Medicaid will be meeting with several of the customized
wheelchair providers to discuss the above-mentioned issue. From the meeting,
Medicaid desires to have a wheelchair reimbursement plan of action that
allows the wheelchair provider to continue to provide quality services to
Medicaid's wheelchair recipients in a cost effective manner.

If you have additional questions, please contact Alanna J. Steaple of my
staff at (850)922-7306.

Sincerely,

Michelle Brantley
Chief, Health Systems Development
Agency for Health Care Administration

                     I recently have become aware of funding issues
concerning the children of the state of Florida, and am very concerned
with the people making decisions for the physically challenged children
of this state. I have attached a letter that I wrote concerning these
issues and the outcome that will result. Please raed my letter and refer

The bill has 65 co-sponsors, but will not go anywhere this session.  
 
There is sentiment for some change in the current policy--which is 50 years old--but right now this legislation is seen as too expensive.  
 
The good news is that this should begin more serious dialogue on making the reserve retirement system more attractive (for recruiting and retention) and equitable to those who are bearing an increasing share of the national defense.  
 
One thing to keep in mind is that with the current 60-year mark there are many service members who die before receiving any benefits at all.

As a voter and taxpayer in Florida for almost 30 years, I am appalled that 
you would ask for proviso language giving 4-year-olds high priority on 
School Readiness Funds in line 2235 of the budget. This move, at the last 
minute and without benefit of the opportunity for public input, is a 
political maneuver to avoid attention being paid to the issue. Further, 
should this proviso language be implemented, it will set a dangerous 
precedent that totally ignores parent need AND parent choice, and further 
fractures the system of early childhood services in the state of Florida.

It does make sense to prioritize, but what I fear is that we are pitting 
one genuinely needy group against another. Overall, when we are talking 
about serving only those children who fall within the 150 percent federal 
poverty level (and most states are at 185 percent in the first place), 
this doesn't really get at the true quality needs for so many families. 
I'd love to have the chance to convince you of the affordable wisdom of

Subject: Insurance Savings

I have a proposal that will help you save the state of Florida
approximately
$175 PER employee, state wide.
It is very simple. Instead of the current $300 to $500 deductible, the
state
would self insure the next $250.00.
I know this sounds impossible, but after 12 months of hard work, a
friend of
mine and I finally convinced our county
commission to implement the program and in the first 12 months, we saved
$386,000 NET, an average saving
of $190 PER employee.

We had one helluva fight, with our Democrat County Commissioner, Judy
Johnson and our risk management department
 battling right to the end, and every employee battling, but they
finally
saw that:

(a) it cost the employees no loss in benefits and no additional out of
pocket cost to them, and
(b) it reflected a net savings to the county.

I am now battling to get the city of Ocala and our school board to
implement
it.

I have no idea how many employees the state has (I am afraid to ask),
but
wouldn't it be
interesting just to look at the facts and figures to see if my friend
who
conceived the plan is
correct?   He has convinced several other governmental agencies to make
the
trial and let
him prove the results.

He would be happy to provide you more information if you are interested.

Governor, good afternoon!  I just received the release that the Senate had
passed the tax conformance measure and hopefully the House will follow suit.
Your dedication and leadership in these critically important economic
development issues continue to move Florida in the direction it must move in
order to remain competitive - thank you for all you do on our behalf!

And thank you for all of your hard work on the Citigroup "Teachers are
Heroes" grant.  It hardly seems possible that the process began over a year
ago on April 10th of 2001 when you responded to my request for a
recommendation on placing a contribution to a not-for-profit
organization/program of high quality, high impact and visibility that would
provide an overall benefit on a statewide basis.  Once again, your direction
and coordination have led directly to Monday's announcement and celebration.
And once again, we will have proven the critics wrong when they say "there
goes the Governor's Office, Enterprise Florida and the Tampa Committee of
One Hundred attracting more of those low-paying, dead-end back-office call
center jobs"!
Nothing could be further from the truth, and when global financial services
companies that provide our citizens with high quality, high paying jobs with
career ladders here in Tampa, Florida, making significant capital
investments in facilities and equipment, but more importantly, providing
significant support to much needed programs in the communities in which they
are located, then that's the real essence of economic development - build
towards the top, but never forget that the entire foundation at the very
lowest level needs to be strong and sustainable in term of the basic
fundamentals, especially education.

My only regret is that I won't be able to join you, George Seegers and Lou
Buccino at the celebration, since I will be in Salt Lake City at the first
CoreNet Global Summit (merger between IDRC and NACORE) where I will moderate
a panel on "Leading Edge Location Strategies" with Mark Klender of Deloitte
and Touche/Fantus, Mike Edwards of Intel, and Dan Malachuk of Arthur
Anderson, and I won't return until Thursday morning.  However, Tampa Chamber
President Kim Scheeler and Chairman Sandy MacKinnon will be there to
represent the Chamber/Committee of One Hundred.  

But rest assured, I'll be there in spirit - and look forward to catching up
with you when I return, as we have several additional great project
announcements upcoming in the next several weeks.

Governor,

After 5 ½ years in office here in Miami, I can tell you we suffer from a serious housing crisis.  A recent study we did shows that just in the area of affordable rentals for low-income families, we have a current need for approximately 20,000 new units.  Our waiting lists for elderly housing are now in excess of 10 years.

That is why I am so disturbed by the attached e-mail.  I can assure you that if there is any surplus in housing funds, we in Miami alone could spend it all to provide for our citizens, not to mention the need that exists elsewhere in the state.  Rather than re-allocate any surplus elsewhere, we need to get more proactive and creative in spending those funds and creating the much need housing.  I would be glad to work with you on that.  But let's save that money in the budget so that we can address very serious needs.

I hope this e-mail finds you well.  My heart goes out to you and your family on the issues with your daughter.  Raising children is never easy.  Our daughter was diagnosed with autism at age 3 and it has been a struggle ever since.  We will keep you and your family in our prayers.

that will ensue. . . increased emphasis on fours will dry up already
difficult to find care for infants and special needs children.  This
legislation could split families so that a working mom has care for a
four year old but none for younger children in the family.  School
readiness begins before birth, not at four.  The idea of universal care
is laudable but for all children, especially those most vulnerable,
infants.  Please continue the trend to give local control to coalitions,

Dear Governor: 

I ask that you take another look at the budget proviso line item 2235.  Local coalitions should be making the decisions about how to spend the dollars allocated to them. The dollars should not be used as a political football.  Lives are at stake here.  The foundation for school readiness is set before the age of three.  Four-year-olds are on the tail-end of school readiness.  George Farkus from Penn State University has found that the amount and type of vocabulary a three-year old has is a direct predictor of later school success.  We need to remember that all funding for all children birth through twelve years of age now funnels through the Partnership for School Readiness to the local coalitions. While providing quality opportunities for four-year olds is critical, what will we say to the working poor who have children of several ages, only one of whom may qualify for services if line item 2235 is finalized?  What will you say when Florida workers cannot work because they do not have access to safe child care? 

Universal PreK has its merits.  However, it must be funded well to work, and funded with committed dollars that do not sacrifice infant and toddler safety.  Nor should the commitment of dollars to four-year olds contribute to higher rates of eventual crime and non-success in school from the children home alone before and after school because the parent or parents could not afford child care.  Talk about investigations - we'll have many more Rilya's on our hands!

Your leadership on this issue is critical at this point in time.  The language in line 2235 sets a dangerous precedent.  It will contribute to unsafe and/or non-existant care for infants and toddlers, and will provide a higher number of children home alone with little or no access to tutoring, supervision, qualilty language, or caring adults to help shape the character of these future voters.

Dear Governor Bush, 

I am deeply concerned about the proviso language giving priority to eligible four year old children after those who are TANF eligible.  I do not feel this is in the best interest of children, the school readiness system and especially for families.  Parents do not generally request child care services for one child in the family, and school readiness begins at birth, not 4 years of age.  

Please do not approve the proviso unless there is adequate financial resources to support the new priority.  If this passes, there will be many more unsupervised babies in jeopardy.

Thank you for your consideration.

Subject: Do not pass proviso language; adequately fund children 0-5


To those of you responsible for providing funds so that we can prepare 
children to be ready for school:

The greatest amount of learning takes place between birth and three years of 
age.  Please do not short change these children in order to provide funding 
for all four year olds.  That too is important.  But provide  additional 
funding to serve all four years olds.  Do not take money from the babies in 
order to help their four year old siblings.

Please face up to your obligations and provide enough money to do the job 
properly.

If you really mean that children are Florida's future, fund services for our 
future.  Provide adequate funding for school readiness so that we can help 
children to be ready for school.

Subject: School Readiness Proviso


The Partnership for School Readiness has drafted proviso language to
prioritize services for four-year-old children.  We believe that it is
crucial to remove the language that states that the second priority
group be " 4 year old children from families that meet the financial
eligibility requirements of s. 411.01(6), Florida Statutes."  This
language takes away local control and decision-making.  Please remember
that school readiness begins at birth.  In some cases, even age 4 is too
late.

Dear Governor Bush, 
 
We are concerned about the proviso language for four year olds. We know you originally proposed additional funding to target four year olds which could be a good target population to serve if additional funds are limited.  However, to create this as a priority without additional funds just creates one more hoop for already overwhelmed School Readiness Coalitions to jump through and one more string attached to an already empty bucket.  It also takes away our Coalition's ability to set priorities for our County.
 
We have over 2000 children on the waiting list for working poor child care in Palm Beach County.  Those children are a priority whether 4 months or 4 years of age. Their parents need to have child care to work.  
 
We support your efforts to recognize early childhood and the connection between Pre-Kindergarten to ready children as they enter school.  Hopefully you and the legislature can find resources to begin to address the overwhelming need for services for the working families in Florida.  Sincerely,

Governor,
FYI...You may recall the case where the 11th Circuit published a scathing
opinion criticizing CCRC's policy regarding the representation of a death
row inmate who had waived his right to appeal. The opinion was particularly
critical of ccrc attorney Todd Scher.

Today, we received the response to your letter regarding the handling of the
Rigoberto Sanchez Velasco case from Neal Dupree, the Capital Collateral
Regional Counsel for the Southern Region.  

The letter answers the four questions you proposed and outlined the actions
he has taken to ensure this situation does not happen again in the southern
region.  Mr. Dupree also indicated that, after a thorough inquiry into the
matter, he asked for and received the resignation of ccrc attorney, Todd
Scher.

Editorial Page Editor
The Tampa Tribune
Mr. Roberts:
I wanted to thank you for yesterday's ("Jeb's One Florida Program Is A
Winner For Minorities"). It was an excellent argument.
It has been my hope that as the facts and the evidence mounted regarding the
One Florida Initiative - as it became clear the initiative was working for
the benefit of all Floridians - that the public would come to recognize it
as a true reform.
I am grateful to you for providing guidance to the reading public and for
helping Floridians recognize the good work that is being done though One
Florida.
One Florida, like all government programs, must be held up to scrutiny. No
program, however well-intentioned, should be free from criticism. One
Florida has, as you noted, gathered criticism that has not always been on
target. Some of its critics have not fairly characterized the mission of the
initiative or the motives of Gov. Jeb Bush in creating it.
Therefore it gave me great comfort to read your words today. We are working
hard to make this reform a powerful tool for opening opportunities for every
Florida child. All of us in education were pleased to see the value of our
work being recognized on your pages.
Sincerely,

Jim  Horne

Barb, I wanted to pass on some good news in our overall FL communications
campaign.

I was contacted by Heather Paltz (with Accenture's Enterprise Integration
Marketing organization) that the FL DBPR project will be awarded first
place in the prestigious EAI Journal awards as the best B2B EAI solution.
She said our solution was the only application awarded a prize in any
category from all Accenture award applications submitted across all market
units.  Heather highlighted this will be very positive publicity and is the
first time an award has been made to a system integrator solution.

Heather said our client representative (Scott Stewart) has been contacted
and notified by the EAI Journal organization.  Heather said we are not
supposed to say anything until the official announcement is made May 15.
Heather is the point person on communications for this.  She is drafting an
internal eGovernment postcard to share this news.  If you need to
coordinate with Heather her number is (917) 452-3492 - Octel 452-3492.

Subject: Fw: Scams Target Veterans for Identity Theft


This is awful.  People in the military suffers enough with health problems from service, military hospitals that have shut down etc.  I see in our paper they are trying to get a bill passed so this is corrected.  Hope it does.
 
 



Scams Target Veterans for Identity Theft 

Army News Service reports that soldiers separating from the military 
should avoid filing their Department of Defense Form 214 (Military 
Discharge) with their local county courthouse. Transition counselors 
are advising soldiers to safeguard their personal information to 
guard against credit fraud. Identity theft is the fastest growing 
crime in the U.S. today, according to the Federal Trade Commission 
(FTC), and servicemembers are inviting targets because everything is 
tied to their Social Security numbers. In a recent case, a Navy 
retiree received a phone call from American Express stating that 
someone was trying to cash a $9,000 check in his name made out to an 
unknown person. Investigation revealed that the retiree's lawyer had 
stolen his identity. The lawyer also had a laptop with several 
thousand military names, Social Security numbers and other 
information on it. The common link among the veterans on the list 
was that they had filed their DD-214s with their county courthouse. 
Once the DD 214 is filed at a courthouse, it becomes a public record. 
Servicemembers are advised to safeguard their DD-214 form as they 
would any vital papers, such as placing it in a safe deposit box. For

Dear Governor Bush: 

My school is dedicating a memorial garden for the victims of September 11 on Friday, May 10, 2001, at 8:30 a.m.  I got to thinking and I thought it would be nice if I invited you to come.  Our art teacher, Mrs. Boni Meddock, designed it and the students and teachers participated in the making of it.  Each of us put a piece of glass into an American flag mosaic and our fifth graders made stepping stone mosaics.  Some students even competed by writing an essay or four verse poem about September 11, why we're proud of our country, or we could make up our own topic about the USA.  The winners, one person from each classroom, (I won for my class!) got to plant something in the memorial garden.  We also get to be at the dedication ceremony!  We're even trying to get people from television stations  to come too! 

I think that my school would appreciate it if you and Mrs. Bush could come.  I know this is short notice, but I thought I would invite you anyway.  If you need to reach Mrs. Meddock, her e-mail address is bmeddock@mail.volusia.k12.fl.us. Thanks for your time Governor Bush!  Good luck in the election! 

Sincerely,

Governor: I am writing to you about Secretary Kearney. I am 57 years old,
spent 26 years as a United States Marine, and have worked steadily since my
retirement from the Corps in '95. In that span of time, I have observed
many leaders?some good, some not so good. The Marine Corps hammers the
principle of leadership by example into the fiber of those entrusted with
the care of young Marines.  In the almost three years I have worked with
Secretary Kearney, she has epitomized the essence of that principle.  In
the face of unrelenting attacks on herself and the organization she leads,
she has held her head high, and fought smart and hard, while at the same
time demonstrating an example of moral courage under fire worthy of
emulation by the best. As hurtful, and unfair as the recent personal
attacks have been, I am sure that it is the horrific event?the child?that
haunts her most. She isn't perfect; none of us are, but she has suited up
daily to do a job, I am embarrassed to say, that I, and most, wouldn't
accept.  As I watch the current furor, I am reminded of Theodore
Roosevelt's marvelously powerful piece entitled "The Man in the Arena." I
have a copy on my office wall.  I am also reminded of my best friend's less

Governor Bush:

I need help for a former exchange student who is now at the University of 
Central Florida finishing up next year in computer graphics and design.

Bard Gunnerud from Oslo, Norway came to the U.S. in 1996 as an exchange 
student living with me and attending Madison County High School here in 
Madison, Florida. While here he did outstanding work here in the Art 
Department and he received a full scholarship from NFCC here in Madison. He 
returned to Oslo and finished his high school work then returned here and 
finished his AA degree at NFCC. He then went on to UCF in Orlando where he 
is working to finish his BFA in computer animation and design.

Since he is a foreign student he is not allowed to work because he has no 
Green Card. Consequently he has to return every summer to work to earn 
spending money for the time he is here going to school.

Norway, being such a small country, has no need for a person with his 
skills. So, I would like for him to get his Green Card so he can fulfill 
his dream of working with movies and/or television to use his skills. Is 
there a way that you could help him get his card OR tell us where to start 
the procedure to obtain one. I know that he will be graduation in the one 
or one and a half years. If you can please help us in any way both Bard and 
I would certainly appreciate it.

Since school is finished for this year, Bard is leaving tomorrow for Oslo 
to work for the summer. I am going over to Norway and Germany on June 11th 
and I would certainly like to tell him how we can start to get his card.

Thanks for you help in this matter.

Subject: Oversight for Opa-locka


Dear Gov. Bush,

Thank you for sending FDLE to our City on a fact-finding investigation
into what is causing the financial problems in Opa-locka. It was most
fortuitous that while they were here, the City received delivery of
eleven (11) new Ford Crown Victoria's. It was even more amusing to see
that of the eleven vehicles delivered, SIX of them will be given to the
five City Commissioners and one (the red one) to the City Manager -
leaving only five cars for the police department.

In addition, we wonder what happened to the FEMA money that Opa-locka
received for the vehicles damaged by the "No-Name Storm" that flooded us
out a few years ago. The police department's rank and file are, on the
most part, hard working and dedicated to their profession. But the
City's administration - including the elected officials - have clearly
shown that they are interested in their own personal welfare and
self-aggrandizement and NOT the welfare of the citizens who elected
them. I have been a Florida police officer since 1968 and with Opa-locka
since 1981. I don't know of any other city or town in Florida that gives
city cars to it's elected officials yet Opa-locka, one of the poorest
communities in Miami-Dade County, does so with no thought to the needs
of the citizens. They feel it is their right to receive the exclusive
use of a $25,000 vehicle for a maximum of 15 hours work per month, while
the Police Department has to beg used cars from other agencies in order
to have enough vehicles to patrol the City.

I have attached the photo of the City Manager's new car, along with some
of the other Commission vehicles that are stored at the back (west)
fence at the City's Public Works Department. In addition, you can rest
assured that the five new vehicles at the police department will remain
parked and unused for a number of months because of the ineffectuality
of the Chief of Police in finding the funding necessary to equip these
vehicles with the necessary emergency equipment and markings.

In order to turn this Police Department around, I suggest that the
following:
1. Enough money to purchase the equipment necessary to do the job -
including new vehicles, lap-top computers, Radios, sirens and light
bars.

2. Enough manpower (we were 51 sworn officers in 1993 and are now 30
full-time sworn in 2002) to effectively respond to the needs of the
community in a proactive manner.

3. Police leadership that has the ability and willingness to perform
their jobs in an efficient and prompt manner.
A. The Chief of Police, though presenting a good public image, has shown
himself to be a stumbling block to the progress of the Department - he
has procrastinated on necessary action in order to receive donated
(free) equipment and failed to act in a timely manner on personnel
actions, causing us to have to retain incompetent or undesirable
employees because of the time constraints involved in disciplinary
action.
He has shown a racist attitude in his promotions in that the #1 position
on the last Sergeant's exam was, and still is, held by a white officer,
yet Wilson promoted the #3 position (a black officer) to the rank of
Sergeant in - of all places Internal Affairs - who was arrested in
Atlanta, GA for urinating in the lobby of a major hotel while
intoxicated, then - one week before his promotion - was sent home
because he reported to work intoxicated and was asleep behind the wheel
of his car in the Police department parking lot.
He promoted an officer to Lieutenant in charge of Patrol who was
arrested several times in Miami-Dade County  - once for D.U.I. and once
for chasing someone with his firearm over a parking space.
B. The "Major" in the Criminal Investigations Division was appointed to
her rank by the former Chief of Police (Craig Collins) because she is
the mother of his illegitimate child and she needed the money. Her track
record as a Division Commander and as a supervisor in general -  has
shown a lack of ability and understanding and an unwillingness to listen
to subordinates who might have valid suggestions to solving particular
problems.

4. A financial (Administrative) officer in the Police Department to keep
track of ALL expenditures and all revenues generated by the Department
and compare it to the Line Item authorizations in the City Budget.

In order to solve the City's financial problems, we need
1. An oversight board to guide and instruct our self-agrandizing City
Commission into how to put the needs of the citizens first.
2. A complete line-by-line review of the City's financial expenditures -
along with contact of the vendors that received funds from the City.
A. We have a Director of Finance who has consistently been unwilling or
unable to cooperate with the Police Department when asked to produce an
accounting of various police grants and the Law Enforcement Trust
Account.

3. A new City Manager who is willing to work with the City employees and
their various bargaining representatives to meet the needs of the
Citizens and the employees who provide the City Services.
A. The current manager eliminated 11 police positions and 14 other
positions in the City and caused an over-all 12.5% reduction in salary
(from a 40 hour to a 35 hour work week) in order to meet "severe budget
shortfalls", but had the nerve to ask for - and RECEIVE - an increase in
salary and benefits for himself and the City Attorney of approximately
$60,000!

This City CAN come back and be the fine, friendly blue-collar community
it was before the Mayor Robert B. Ingram years. It just takes some
funding and equipment to "prime the pump" and elected officials who will
put the needs of the community first - not buy into the on-going
attitude of "what's in it for me?"

Sincerely,

Tony Lacks

The funding that was appropriated was not for the faith based dorms, the six
the bill required DOC to set up, but for "transitional" faith based beds in
the community.  currently, the state funds part of the Kairos program,
Kairos and DOC were both under the impression that the new faith dorms would
be funded the same way, but ultimately, they were not and the money went to
transitional beds.  i think this was one of the issues brad raised last year
in objection to the bill.

Governor discussed faith-based dorms with me yesterday.  In reviewing
material you sent to me on this a couple weeks ago, why is it that the
new
faith-based dorms were implemented differently than Tomoka, with one
contractor in charge of all programs for dorm?  it looks like new
faith-based dorms are a hodgepodge of providers and vendors at each
facility.  What was rationale behind that? is this approach more
effective
with inmates than having one provider at each institution, like you do
for
Tomoka?  did you all consider having a few of each type to mix them up a
little bit in an effort to see what approach works better?

Being able to eventually shut down dirty coal plants by using "off peak" power will reduce Acid Rain.

This will win him the massive environmental vote everywhere, even in California.

As we were preparing our presentation to some North Carolina legislators, we used the following three quotes about the FCT program.  You have supported and protected this program, and I thought you might like to see how others feel about it...

"In the last three years, the City of Jacksonville has doubled its park space to become one of the largest city park systems  in the nation. Our Preservation Project has had numerous partners, but none as helpful as the Florida Communities Trust. Together we've changed the face of our city - forever." 
Mayor John Delaney, City of Jacksonville

"The Florida Communities Trust Program has been a tremendous asset to the City of Tampa's urban open space programs like its 'Ribbon of Green' land acquisition plan along the Hillsborough River shoreline. FCT alone provided our City with $12,727,500, which allowed the City to leverage other local and State open space/environmental grant programs for its land acquisition." 
Mayor Dick Greco, City of Tampa

"TPL's partnerships with local land conservation grant programs have never been better exemplified than in the Florida Communities Trust. FCT's ability to empower communities to achieve their vision and preserve their natural and cultural character is changing the face of Florida's landscape.  The Trust for Public Land points to FCT as a model for communities all over the nation."

Dear Jeb
 
Thanks for the email.  I have never seen such a fast response in the 45 years I have been working with Governors.  I truly do appreciate it.
 
The people in Glades County desperately need this project.  It is my understanding that INS can contract with such a facility as they are doing so currently.  It is also my understanding that they can not commit or enter into an agreement to place detainees in any facility more six months into the future.  Our contractor is anticipating the completion of this project in August or September of 2003.  Therefore, Glades County will in January or February enter into discussions with INS to house detainees.
 
At the present time they are not asking for an INS commitment.  They want a meeting to discuss INS requirements so that we build the facility to their standards.  Of course we also want to impress on them our progress in that bonds are being sold with a projected closing of July 1st and settlement on July 11th.
 
We would very much appreciate having a meeting arranged with a responsible INS official in Washington by the Governors office instead of being arranged by congressional representatives.  I am attaching my original summary of the project which might be helpful in discussions with INS.  
 
Have a nice day and thanks again.

To make it short she is on United Healthcare thru Medicaid and has had several surgeries in the last 2 years. We have seen local Neurosurgeons & they cant seen to correct the problem but just keep trying. I found the Chiari Clinic in New York and our PCP had sent for a authorization to see Dr. Milhorat there & we were denied coverage due to no out of area Benifts... Is there anything you can do to help us get the authorization we need to have our daughter seen by the only Chiari Clinic in the US????? Please Help, this is Brain surgery we are dealing with and she has already had 4-5 including VP shunt insertion, Decompression, Laminectomy, Durapath, CSF Leaks & now she has 2 Meningoceles as well as Syrinx in the spinal area..

Subject: Requested info re: an HCC budget matter
Sensitivity: Private


Dear Governor Bush,
Robert and I very much enjoyed see you in Tampa on the 17th and especially
appreciated your candid insight into where we are as we move toward November
5th. We look forward to continuing to work on the successful and rewarding
effort of your re-election.
As you may recall, we spoke briefly after that meeting about an issue
concerning Hillsborough Community College, for which I serve as a member of
the District Board of Trustees (currently as chairman) thanks to your
original appointment of me in 1999. You told me you thought it was in the
current budget but I have been watching very closely and am fairly certain
it is not there. I recognize that legislation is not my business thought and
may be missing it.  But staff at HCC also tell me they can't find it either.
I have attached the talk sheet that has been used for promoting the sale and
transfer of the W.T. Edwards property to HCC. The talk sheet explains that
we are asking for a special appropriation to PECO that will enable HCC to
purchase the property from the Department of Children and Families, which
will allow them to use to proceeds of the sale to build a sexual predator
facility.
The property has been recently appraised at approximately $8 million.
Having the appropriation go to the College through PECO puts us in the
drivers seat in closing the sale. Plus, it permits you and the Legislature
to show additional funds allocated to education, while protecting Floridians
from sexual predators.
There are precedents for colleges using PECO to purchase state lands and for
special appropriations to PECO.
I am told we have support of this approach from Amy Baker (CFO of the Dept.
of Children and Families), and Colleen Castille (your Director of Cabinet
Affairs)
Again, this appropriation does not appear to be in either the House or
Senate budgets. However, Rep. Murman indicated that she will be on the look
out for money that becomes available in the closing minutes of the Session.
I am sure that if we have your support we will attain the appropriation.
It is important to note that we cannot jeopardize any of the College's
existing PECO projects in order to fund this request. In addition, we do not
wish to reduce the community college system's PECO appropriation in order to
fund this request.
Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions. Thank you for
your attention and support of this matter.

Yours truly,

Nancy

hi governor
 
first, i understand that nora williams is going to maybe resign her seat on the monroe county commission shortly,  that is sad and she will be missed.  guess i understand since one of the fellows at the south florida water management district (tony burns) died a few days ago of diabetes (he did not show for work and one of his friends found the body) tony was a big fan of yours, he was the district clerk and was underappreciated around that place. 
 
anyway, we sure would like to have a bill signing thing in tlh of hboi or wherever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,   that is if it does not get vetoed so i guess that is the first plea.   as it ended no other tags or other bad things got attached to it is a clean thing
 
hope you are having success with the special session,  i think you probably received a picture from steve with us and our jebs hats and about the coolest little dolphin in the world,  rocketman (elton john)

				Gov Bush - as brief as I can, here's a great Bush-Brogan success story...maybe you could participate.

				A 5th grade student at West Riverside Elementary School (a mostly urban, minority public elementary school) in Jacksonville was recently notified that he won a national essay contest sponsored by Southwest Airlines.  

				Southwest has sponsored a national mentoring program, through its pilots, for a number of years.  It started through its partnership in America's Promise (Colin Powell) and continues...Laura Bush was involved in TX, where SW is based.  The essay contest, a component of the mentoring program, asked students to write a 100-word essay on how their teachers go "above and beyond."  SW got 2500 essays from around the US.  A Jax public school 5th grader, who has had health, incl open heart surgery, and learning difficulties...and can only write with the assistance of a computer, won.  Even more, this is a public school that was a D school until recently when, inspired by Gov. Bush's mentoring initiative, area business leaders began mentoring the school through the "Partnerships to Advance School Success (PASS)" program.  The school improved to a "C" in 2001 and teachers/administrators expect a "B" this year.

				Southwest is awarding the winner's 5th grade class a round-trip from Jacksonville to New Orleans.  The students of the West Riverside 5th grade class (plus parents) will fly, with the student's mentor-pilot, to New Orleans for the day and study the geography and history of the French Quarter, Cajun dancing, the Mississippi River, etc.  This will be the 1st time that some of these students, and even their parents, have flown on an airplane.  The trip will happen on May 8th.  A send-off event is planned for approx. 9 am at the Jacksonville Airport.

				I know the your normally intense schedule is especially intense with special session and this is short notice,...however, this is a great success story that originates from your leadership...its about improving Florida education, mentoring, promoting tourism/business in Florida (w Southwest), an inspirational young student...the fact that its at the urban and formerly neglected West Riverside is even more impressive.

				I think you should consider: a) a quick trip to Jax on the morning of May 8th to lead the send-off celebration for the 5th grade class; or, b) a congratulatory letter/proclamation that can be read at the event.

				Southwest has extensive media is involved in the send off.  CBS/CH4 will accompany the class on the trip.

				Thanks.

Subject: Outreach Contract Signing Event



I am pleased to extend an invitation to Governor Jeb Bush to attend the
kick-off and ceremonial contract signing for the South Florida Water
Management District (SFWMD) Business Management and Technical Assistance
Initiative.  We would like to host the Governor for this event on either
May 16 or May 17, 2002, his calendar permintting.  If the Governor is
unable to attend we would be pleased if he could send his special
assistant, Wendy Grant, to represent him.

The District is poised to approve at its Governing Board meeting on May
9, 2002 a contract with the Florida Venture Foundation (FVF) and the
Black Business Association (BBA) to provide management and technical
assistance to small businesses in Dade and Broward counties.  This
assistance, which will consist of outreach, technical assistance, and
access to capital and bonding, will be available to small firms located
in Dade, Broward and Monroe counties.  The District recognizes the
particular ability of the FVF and the BBA to inclusively  outreach to
the business community and expects services to be provided to a diverse
group of firms.

The initiative will serve to increase the capacity of ready willing and
able small contractors available for SFWMD contracting opportunities,
particularly in the area of everglades restoration.  In the spirit of
One Florida, this is a race/gender neutral approach to diversity which
provides firms the skills and tools necessary to better compete for
contract opportunities without goals, quotas, or governmental
programs.   This is an historic partnership between government and the
non-profit community to provide services that will help the District
accomplish all the objectives of everglades restoration.

We hope you or a representative from your staff will be able to attend.

Governor Bush, 

      I am forwarding a copy of an e-mail I recently sent to Michael Moore, DOC secretary.  I would like you to read it.  You may feel it does not concern you, but as the governor of our state, I think you should be aware of what goes on in agencies you are ultimately responsible for. 
       
      The issues facing my daughter are particularly troublesome to me, because she's been in a prison setting since she was 15-years-old, and I know how fragile her state of mind is.  As I mentioned to Mr. Moore, as her mother, I do not like to see my daughter mistreated and feel I must try to protect her in any way I can. I'm sure as a father you can understand that. 

Thank you,

Subject: What is wrong with education?


PLEASE RESPOND TO THIS MESSAGE AFTER YOU HAVE READ IT!

I grew up in a small southern town where I was able to take advantage of the
American precept which says that I can do anything I am able or willing to
do.  Everything I learned was from public education and it was wonderful and
so rewarding.  After graduating from high school I chose to enter the field
of education by becoming a teacher. I truly believed I could make a
difference.  My goal was to become a high school mathematics teacher.  I
have been a public educator for almost 16 years and I have experienced and
seen quite a bit throughout this time spent teaching and learning.  I have
become frustrated and, almost at times, would have thrown in the towel if it
were not for my children who have now enter the public school system.

I have worked for six different superintendents and for several different
principals.   Some changes occurred because of elections and pure politics
and others, not due to incompetence on my part, but due to a greater desire
to experience rich and rare opportunities.  I have been selected teacher of
the year and also county teacher of the year and have earned a specialist
degree in mathematics education.  I share this simply to help you understand
that my concerns are true and straightforward and not one of vindication or
assault.

I have determined over the years that the counties and schools rich with
high moral and achievement are the ones that have somehow selected awesome
administrators and leaders that are focused in on the real meaning of
education.  From this observation I can truly say that I believe politics is
³killing² our public schools.


You talk about increased funding and teacher retention initiatives.......

The legislature may increase funding, but because of the loop holes,
earmarks, or superintendent and principal authority, it is rarely seen at
the classroom or teacher level.  I talk only for the school systems who are
not politically lucky!

I want to share a couple of examples that I have experienced this year:

    Over the past three years as a group, teachers have always voted on how
our lottery dollars should be used.  One year we had just re implemented a
music program that had been greatly missed and chose to use the entire sum
on music equipment.  the next year we agreed to purchase the Accelerated
Reading program and several hundred books and tests.  This year however, the
rules changed.  The teachers did not get to decide how our lottery dollars
were to be spend.  We were informed four days before the event that over $5,
500  were to be spent for what we called an "FCAT Blowout"  where inflatable
were to be rented.   This event was to reward student two days BEFORE the
FCAT.  The teachers were not given the opportunity to come together as a
group to spend this money or even vote on this decision.  We were informed
however that the Advisory Board had chosen to spend it and did not need
teacher input..    I WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE LAW SAYS ABOUT THIS!!  WHEN YOU
RESPOND WILL YOU INCLUDE COMMENTS ABOUT THIS!  Their was so much more we
needed to do with this money.  I agree we need to reward children, but why
not reward them after the FCAT is over for being on time and working hard.
Why should we waste on inflatable moon walks and why $5,500  when money is
suppose to be so tight!

    During the 16 years I have been in education, the only dependable raise
I received was the one for completing a degree program.  There are many
years when we received nothing or maybe just 2% .  It is true that I did not
chose the profession because of the salary, but that does not mean that I
should not get the standard 3% living increase each year along with my
steps.  Each year we have to grovel for just step increases which, in our
county, not everyone gets.  If the governor wanted to make a difference for
educators, it would be LAW that teachers would receive at lease a 3% raise
and a step each year.  THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR ALL EDUCATORS.  This
year, because of insurance and only a step increase, I will be making less
than I made last year.  Yes I received the 850 bonus because there was not a
way for the county to weasel out of giving the money, but i ask you this.
What does a bonus do for my retirement.  If my salary never increases how
will my retirement fund increase?  At this point, you are probably arguing
that the September 11 incident created this mess.  Well, I will tell you
that the very devastating incident was just an excuse to let everyone off
the hook.  This has been going on for years.  All public (politics again)
leaders received their raises.  Do you know that our school board members ,
who received a raise this year, make more than a starting teacher in my
county and only meet about 16 times a year.  What does that say to a
teacher... that working from 7:30 - 3:00 everyday (many stay much longer)
managing and preparing 25 students and grading papers at night (not to
mention anytime in planning activities) is not as an important task as
meeting 16 times a year to decide on county issues????


You talk about increased student achievement through accountability.......

It is true that I believe that accountability is a good means to an end, but
we have lost sight of what the ³accountability² is doing to classroom.
Because the FCAT only tested reading and writing, what do you think happened
to science and social studies in most classes?  I guess you will find out
soon enough after seeing the results of the Science FCAT test.   There is
only so much time in a day to teach, so out of necessity, teachers have
learned how to teach FCAT skills and items only.   So, of course, scores are
getting higher.   


You talk about the Excellent Teaching Program.......

I believe that this is a wonderful opportunity and I did apply to become a
Nationally certified teacher.  One of the main highlights is the raise it
would give me and my family.  Because I am not a classroom teacher NOW I did
not have a mathematics class and had to ³borrow one.²  It was very difficult
to do the required assignments with this ONE class.  I thought I had done a
reasonable job on the portfolio, but I was not successful.  I hope in the
future there will be a category for technology specialist or technology
resource teacher.  I wish I had been teaching mathematics over the past few
years because it would have given me the opportunity to be successful in my
endeavor.  Hopefully my subject will be added soon.

In closing, I am a true Republican and supported Governor Bush and Lt.
Governor Brogan.  However, there is so much more that needs to be done to
help education.  Somethings are good, and some are bad.  The best advice I
can give both is to not only make changes in the law but make sure that it
is getting to the place where it needs to be and that is to teachers and
students.  Our teachers are the front line and everyone else are only around
as a support staff.  Legislatures, governors, superientendents, and
princiapls,  all of which seem to be getting raises and salary incresaes
each year, must be more precious to the education of our children than a
teacher. It seems that everyone believes that teachers are not vital to
education.

But since the project was in last year's budget, it would be a new project that would not necessarily fit your funding policy for water projects.

You will recall we talked about a vote later this year in Miami-Dade 
County on a dedicated funding source for children, as seven other Florida 
counties already have. The House and Senate passed SB 2086 to create The 
Children's Trust, which now upon your signature would go to the county

Students from all over this beautiful state compete in Radio Control Robotic, Transportation Modeling, Manufacturing Proto type, Structure Engineering, Desk Top Publication, Imaging Technology, Film Technology,  Research and Design of future Alt Vehicles and many others. My philosophy of teaching technology is hands on minds on. We do several TSA problem solving activities through out the year to prep the for the big dance.  Our students won a record breaking 27 Trophies.  We also won First Place Outstanding Chapter and the 2002 Spirit Award. Next month we are going to National in Denver Colorado.  At Nationals we will be competing against 3000 of the top students in the country in engineering and problem solving activities.  
    I realize you are a very busy man.  This may be a major thing to ask but my student deserve it.  Would you please in some way recognize my students for this Outstanding accomplishment.  Tomorrow when I'm at school I will send state results with names of students and the competition they won. Write them a letter or even come to the Sci Tech Center it is in Melbourne, Fl right by Florida Instituted if Technology. For most of my students this was the single most positive thing that has ever happened in their lives.  It will never happen again. In just two weeks my seniors will be gone but never will they be forgotten.  See we built a Dream Team in the Sci Tech Center and it will always be the place where we all come together as one.  Each student knew up front that success wasn't going to be found at the end of the road,  it was going to be found along the way.  Please understand this is top AP kids we have a good cross section of the student population of Palm Bay High.  These young men and woman are now the best of the best and know one can take that away from them.  They pave their way to success everyday through hard work, commitment and perseverance.   This dream team and shot for the stars. Funny as it may seem they became one.  Please help make this positive learning experience become an even more positive as a memory. They say no day is over if it makes a memory.   It would mean so much to have you recognize this outstanding group for their awesome achievement.  In just two short weeks my seniors will be gone but never will they be forgotten.  Thank you for your time and I appreciate what you do for Florida schools and more importantly for our future, our students.

Subject: Please Help My Neighborhood


Dear Governor, Commissioners, and  folks at Orlando Sentinel, the children in my neighborhood need your help.
 
    I live in Orlando, in a nice little neighborhood, Haralson Estates, except for a polluted lake.  For 20 years, all efforts to clean up this lake have been thwarted by one property owner adjacent to the lake.  The city and county have agreed to provide some $200,000 worth of improvements, all studies have been completed, and the money is available, to no avail. 
 
    The property owner has been cited for lots of code violations, but he has some sort of ancient, mysterious sweetheart agreement that has been grand-fathered in, to prevent anyone or any government agency from any kind of easement to do any improvement.  The neighborhood has about 100 houses, and commercial development has encircled us with no playground for the children.  None whatsoever, and this is our only hope.
 
    City Commissioner Daisy Lynum and County Commissioner Homer Hartage have been trying to help us for years, but have been ineffective against this unusual arrangement. Common sense and decency have no effect on the property owner, and lawyers have been stymied by this unorthodox incongruity.  A nonresident, this Mr. Duncan shows no concern that his actions and defiance is adversely affecting a lot of people, especially kids.
 
    The actual name of the lake is Natasulga, but we all call it Lake Nasty.  The lake is on the north side of the 2800 block of Arlington, south of Colonial Drive, just east of John Young Parkway in Orlando.  You can't miss it, your eyes and nose won't let you. A horrible eyesore, our neighborhood association has finally got a hearing at City Hall Second Floor Council Chambers on May 8th at 9 A.M. Any help or encouragement would be appreciated.  
 
Thank you, it is sincerely to give our kids a place to play, and Governor, here's a special prayer for your daughter.

Hey! I'm concerned about the affect of the possible Vieques mission relocation to Eglin. General Hodgekins indicated to me last week that move would likely close Tyndall's primary mission of pilot training. The Navy's proposal of conducting the training missions 3 times a year for 2 weeks each time would prevent Tyndall from training in the Gulf. Since Eglin controls the Gulf range, they will prohibit Tyndall from using the range during their training. It is my understanding that Tyndall uses the range more than all other users combined. The training missions would disrupt the Tyndall pilot training syllabus so that the pilots could not complete their training within the schedule outlined by the Air Force. 

I've talked with Brian Yablonski and Brett Doster about these concerns and they can give you more details. At your convenience, it might be useful for you to call General Hodgekins and cross-examine him about what Vieques-to-Eglin will really mean to Bay County.   

I'm proud of you! William

Dear Governor Jeb Bush:

You're exactly right.  The voters should know what a Constitutional Amendment would cost, before they are asked to vote on it.  If they knew the cost of the High Speed Train project, they probably wouldn't have voted for it.

This fall we're probably going to be asked to vote on the size the school classrooms.  It's important that we know the cost involved.  The citizens of Florida should know that they will pay extra taxes to get this reduction in classroom size.  If they vote on it as an emotional issue, with no thought of the cost - that's wrong.

Hello Governor Bush,  I would like to tell you of the help I received from our Local Police Department in LaBelle.  I have a Group Home for Developmentally Delayed, housing 5 adults.  One of my clients has a behavior of invading others space, privacy and stealing. I am worried that she is going to be in a situation of extreme difficulty if not helped, as her stealing is not just in the home.  I asked for the help of the LaBelle Sheriff  Steve Worley, who invited my client to have a tour of the jail as a deterrent measure.  Corporal Tracy McClain talked to my client and arranged for her to go into the jail. He were incredible, very assertive, but not aggressive in his approach to her problem, she was taken
into the jail to see what happens to offenders.  It has had a very positive effect on her and she has said she does not want to go there again under any circumstances.  I am hoping this will help in her behavior problem to eliminate her stealing.  I felt you needed to have a positive story about out law enforcement.  Thank you for your time.

Subject: Coverage of Urinozinc-Prostahelp, dietary supplement for the prostate by Medicaid


May 3, 2002
 
Honorable Governor Jeb Bush
Tallahassee, Florida
 
Dear Jeb:
 
On May 2, 2002, I was in Tallahassee in separate meetings with John O. Agwunobi, M.D., Secretary of Health, and Ms. Mary Pat Moore, Assistant Deputy Secretary for Medicaid Operations, to discuss the possibility of Urinozinc-Prostahelp, dietary supplement for the prostate to be covered by Medicaid.
 
I presented to both of them a presentation letter along with a company packet of Urinozinc-Prostahelp, of which I am sending you a copy under separate cover via mail. 
 
Mr. Jerry Wells, Pharmacy Program Manager for the Medicaid Pharmacy Program, was also present during my meeting with Ms. Moore, and has been very much aware of this product for quite some time.  Although Mr. Wells is an active defender of drugs, he admitted to Ms. Moore and myself that Urinozinc-Prostahelp really works, and that he has personally used the product.  He further admitted Medicaid coverage of Urinozinc-Prostahelp could save Medicaid a lot of money.
 
I actually think, based on my experience of ten years in the Miami area that the Medicaid coverage of Urinozinc-Prostahelp could save Medicaid 30% to 40% of total monies spent on prostate drugs.  Please see the price comparison chart below:

Price Comparison

Drugs v. Dietary Supplement
Price per year Medicaid cost

Proscar
$1040.76

Hytrin 1 mg
$716.76

Hytrin 2 mg
$752.76

Hytrin 5 mg
$806.76

Cardura 1 mg, 2 mg, 3mg
$500.76

Cardura 5 mg
$518.76

Urinozinc-Prostahelp, dietary supplement for the prostate
$250.00
 
Mr. Wells raised the issue of the difficulties involved for the processing of payment for non-drug products. The whole situation regarding this product is now open and we are trying to find a solution that as a result will save Florida Medicaid millions of dollars and serving the purpose of helping seniors maintain a healthy prostate. 
 
Jeb, I sincerely hope a pilot program can be initiated in the Dade county area for one or two years in order to properly evaluate its results.
 
Another, issue raised during this meeting was that perhaps companies of other dietary supplements will argue that they also deserve the same treatment.  However, as I pointed out to them, Urinozinc-Prostahelp is the only dietary supplement for the prostate with a U.S. Patent, and the only one submitted to two clinical studies with excellent results as mentioned in their letter (see attachment).  Finally, you can be sure this is a win win situation for the state of Florida.
 
Sincerely yours,

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I was deeply touched by your recent presentation to the drug treatment and prevention professionals and law enforcement officers summit.  We send you our good energy and your family will stay in our prayers.
 
Several years ago a dear friend, Maurice Sweeney, was found dead in the toilet of a McDonald's in central Dublin from an overdose of heroine.  Maurice was an incredibly talented artist and a wonderful human being.  His death changed my life forever.  Thereafter, whenever the opportunity arose, I have spoken out and worked to eradicate our society from this blight on our community.  
 
I wish to pass on to you one idea from Ireland that had a very profound, positive effect on users and potential users of drugs.  Radio Telefis Eireann (the Irish national TV station) completed a program on drug use.  It was so stark, horrific and visually descriptive that the station, and the Irish Department of Health, credited it's airing with a substantial downturn in drug use for several years.
 
The station interviewed drug users - almost all long-term drug users - in their homes (often these places were the streets, under bridges, wooded areas etc.) and offered them anonymity.  Some choose the anonymous route, but most choose to conduct the interviews without anonymity.  Those who did participate were, as far as I recall, immune for prosecution for drug use up to that point in time.  
 
The drug users where filmed preparing drugs, discussing drugs, and shooting drugs (usually heroine) into many parts of their bodies.  The most horrific part of all was where drug users, who had so abused their 'obvious' vein sources, were reduced to injecting drugs through the veins in their groin areas.  This was all raw footage.  The overwhelming dinginess of the lives of the drug users on the film, had the effect of portraying an image of people so hopeless, so degenerate, so helpless, and so fragile that it led the Department of Health to declare the project a great success.
 
Doing something like this in our great state to show to schools might be a help with our children.  If you wish, I will gladly get a copy of the video for you.
 
Governor, it has taken me a long time to get up the courage to write this to you.  I thought I'd just continue to pray for your family, for all families, and that that would be enough.  Now, I am convinced that I should no longer keep this idea to myself.  With all best wishes,

Dear Governor,

As current chairman of the Florida Self-Insurance Guaranty Association
and on behalf of our Board,  I  recommend that you approve HB 319.

We have been ad vised that Commissioner Tom Gallagher is recommending that you veto because FSIGA would have too much power.  The commissioner nor any of his representatives objected to the bill in committee, house floor and senate floor debate,  In fact the
commissioner supported  request that FSIGA come under his office
and we agreed.

Governor, if you have any reservations or concerns about the legislation,  as chairman of the board, I pledge our total support for
any  change  in a glitch bill next session.  In the interim,  I will instruct
FSGIA director Baxter  Swing to strictly adhere to any recommendation
from your office regarding administration of Workers Compensation.

FSGIA public-private partnership with Florida,  will significantlly reduce
cost to Florida taxpayers and more importantly protect injured workers.

Thank you for your outstanding leadership and service to Florida.

Dear Governor:

I was attending the "heroes luncheon" this afternoon in Tampa when you
addressed the room.  It was a moving tribute to all of the men and women who
serve our Country.  You would have been very proud of our State as Gen.
Franks represented our local community and our Country with such eloquence.
Your comments were heard by 5,000 who attended today's event.

I was also reminded to follow up with you on the issues we have discussed
previously.

I have had the opportunity to speak with you in person about the issue
related to the construction industry.  Specifically, our company, The A.D.
Morgan Corporation, with offices in Tampa and Melbourne have had two of our
Construction Contracts for Dept of Juvenile Justice put on indefinite hold
($15 million).  As you will recall, these are 90% Federally funded with the
money available to spend now.  The Juvenile Justice project in Seffner($7.3
million)  has been ready  to break ground since December of 2001.  The
project was stopped two weeks prior to our notice to proceed.

This has been quite a challenge for our company and to date, we have not
been successful in  replacing that revenue for the year 2002. Additionally,
we are currently contracted for work at the Lowell Correctional Institution,
(Ocala)  with a need for budget approval for our contract to be continued.
My understanding is that the budget request from DOC does not have much
support at this time.

While my first concern is my company, I want to take the opportunity to once
again make certain that you are aware that your directive to "boost the
economy through construction is NOT what is being funded".  Small business
comprises the heartbeat of our state.  As a small business employer of 50
people, responsible for their families, I must tell you that without
construction project funding for state projects, we will take a huge loss as
well as loose employees.  Our annual revenue is appx $50 million, we are in
our 14th year of business, this is our worst year yet.

With all that you are responsible for, please check to make certain that
construction funding is getting the attention you intended.  We need your
help.  Please let me know who I should speak with regarding funding for the
contracts we currently hold.

Sincerely and
with my full support,

Rebecca Smith, President
The A.D. Morgan Corporation

PS  I was having dinner with Congressman Sonny Montgomery on my recent trip
to Washington.  He asked about you and sends his best.  He also, encouraged
me to make certain to follow up and let you know what was happening with our
contracts.

Thanks again for your attention.  See you in Tampa on your next visit if not
the Republican Victory Committee Dinner.

I'm really looking forward to the upcoming London Trade Mission.  As
I've mentioned in the past, visitors from the United Kingdom represent
20% of  Kennedy Space Center's total visitation.  Since 9/11, business
has been slow to come back, although I think we are on the road to
recovery.  A trip overseas meeting the right people can certainly spark
more interest in Florida and the Space Center. 

Additionally, it certainly would be terrific for the thousands of

>Governor, as a native of Miami and long involved with the DCF on a personal and professional level . . I can only continue to say the weakest link in our children’s service agencies  is DCF.  Rilya’s situation is not the only problem. I monitor sites for a variety of reasons . . .I work supposedly in tandem with the licensing unit for child care and family child care homes . . .I could tell you stories that would make you cry.  There are many of us trying to improve the quality of care offered in our early care and education environments and then there are those of us who are just working for a paycheck.  To Blame Chuck Auslander or Judge Kearney is not reasonable- the standards for hiring staff are dismal you get the caliber of people you recruit and pay for.  The good ones that stay rise to the top and are replaced again and again in the field.  When my sister did her internship (she is a psychologist) she found case files hidden in the drop ceiling, when she was injured by an orderly at a DCF facility they settled out of court with her because the attorney discovered the employees training file was a forgery.  I have made it my business to know the law and respect the intent of statute, I have had caseworkers tell me I was full  . . well figure out the rest.  This is not new, there were problems when Jim Towey was DA, Anita Bock did her damnest to make it work after the restructuring, I can’t fault any of those who are “at the top” - it is the belligerent,  barely educated case workers who should be given an extensive psych profile before they are ever allowed to have any semblance of authority over others.  The level of education is documentable but not relevant (or in some instances valid  . . .but that’s another subject).

Importance:	High

Dear Sharon, 
 
Thanks for your willingness to try to help these folks. You've spent an enormous amount of time and energy pursuing these matters with appropriate officials and we're doing the best we can to get this important message delivered. 
 
So far, no interest has been shown.  
 
Have you tried the ACLU in Miami? 
 
Also, there is a Miami Alternative Dispute Resolution group. I don't remember exactly where it's located? Because of all the system problems I've been having the last couple of weeks I've been out of the loop, so to speak. 
 
I saved access to the ADR group but lost it while trying to save my computer from total destruction. I'll check around to see if I can find it again and will let you know. You'll probably find it in the Yellow Pages of your telephone book under? No matter what word you use for yellow pages they seem to refer you somewhere else but I'd try; Mediation?  
 
I had a message from our CONDO chair Humberto in Miami but lost that, too. I think he said he had contacted several Hispanic organizations about this Timberlake situation because of the discrimination and possible civil rights violations being perpetrated upon these Florida residents. Keep in touch with him. Both of you are closest to the action down there. 
 
BTW, I'm going to send this to Gov Bush. He does read his mail private e-mail and sometimes sends out a terse reply. 
 
Sometimes it's very difficult for 'government' to comprehend these situations. I think they have the impression that some people deal in conspiracies so they sluff this stuff aside. 
 
I'm specifically concerned about Florida and have been for several years because of state endorsement of the enticements from the stakeholders and industry partisans to convince people to relocate while Caveat Emptor not Full Disclosure are the "Buy Words" during real estate transactions. 
 
While, I'm sure, there are thousands of content Citizens living in CID's in our state the failure to disclose before and after contract is a stupid way to run a railroad.
 
That's we tried so hard to have our Property Reform Task Force enacted during the recent legislative session but it fell on deaf ears at the Executive and Legislative levels of government. 
 
It's very sad, really! 
 
Apparently, the Hispanic's in the Miami area are taking it on the chin by unscrupulous individuals. I hope Governor Bush really listens this time and empower's the AG to conduct an appropriate investigation of the situation you've aluded to in your dealings with Tay and others down there.  
 
It's simply amazing that some lawyer hasn't taken up this cause and filed a class action lawsuit to expose this fraud. 
 
Well, we'll see if justice for the Citizens of Florida previal. At the moment, the scales are tipped in the wrong direction.  
 
As you know, along with yours, you can't see addresses on the Bcc line because they are suppressed. So it might look as if the message is going nowhere but I guarantee you it is far-reaching.  
 
Keep the faith. Maybe we'll get to the bottom of this terrible situation and expose what's going on down there. 
 
As you know, CBS 20/20 did a segment on HOA's a couple of weeks ago which upset the industry partisans, like the Community Association Institute which has come into private partnership with the Department of Business and Professional Regulation in Florida. 
 
We're still waiting for a response from Governor Bush, et al., about our concerns over this matter. As long as the CAI, a trade organization,  and it's legislative action committee's are running the show in Tallahassee we'll continue to have a difficult time achieving our goals and objectives to protect homeowners rights.  
 
I think CAI was part of a conspiracy to find the worst neighors in America which was shown on ABC 48 Hours the other day. Dan Rather got sucked in by these partisans. I suppose he doesn't know any better? 
 
Have a nice weekend.
 
The best to you and yours, 
Bob, 
Ocala, FL

Subject:	Liza McFadden Meeting

Good Morning Jeb:
I don't know if Liza has had a chance to inform you as yet, but we 
met for about an hour this past Thursday, May 2 at her office at the
Capitol. What a great lady she is.  I brought her a copy of my book
"Resurrection of America: A Plan and Vision for Launching Communities on
Pathways of New Ethics, Morals, Values and Meanings for the Benefit of
Our Children." The time is right for a book such as this to help
capitalize on the "unity" and cohesiveness  of Americans since the
tragedies of 9/11.

Liza was quite taken aback with the fact I had written the book in such a
short period of time and had it in pre-publication form to give to her by
our meeting.  I also felt she was quite impressed with the content and
mentioned how the book was so detailed and flowed so well. It was a good
meeting and I hope I was able to impart to her the significance of the
book, it's intent and potential to try and make a difference in some way.
I have been communicating with a publisher on the west coast but have not
made any final decisions as yet. Of course I am wanting the "best deal"
which will get me major distribution and marketing and that which will
help me get this out to the masses.

After the meeting I delievered a copy of the book along with a request to
you to consider writing a preface/liner note for the book, and some
letters the kids at H.E.M. Club sent to you, to Georgia your
receptionist.  I hope you received them. Knowing you may not have the
time to read the book, I have asked Liza  to let you know her thoughts on
the book and the message and content. I also let her know of my request
for your consideration of liner notes and she emailed me she "would check
to see if you did things like this and get right back with me". I did not
hear from her on Friday, but I am certain she is on the case for me
knowing that she is very adept at her job. I am also trying to acquire
liner notes from notables such as Oprah Winfrey, Bill O'Reilly, Billy
Graham etc. 

Jeb, when I received a letter from Tara Wainright declining my request
for a meeting with you, she told me another  individual from your office
would be contacting me soon for a meeting.  I have not been contacted as
yet and wondered if these plans were still in motion. I am certain  Liza
can enlighten you ...whatever you do Jeb, please keep education Florida's
#1 priority....we'll find a way together to make everyone else realize,
it must be.

Keep up the good work and thank you for all your support and
encouragement and for all you do for the children of Florida.

Governor: Thank you for expanding the Special session of the Legislature to include health care.  Thanks to you the legislature was able to pass "Prompt PAY", HB37-E SB46-E. This important legislation will help ensure that patients of Florida have access to quality, affordable health care.  This bill will also help ensure that physicians and hospitals get paid by HMOs and PPOs on a fair and timely basis. Thanks again for your help and please sign the bill.

Hi, is this going to include the 16-17 year old? Like the 10-20-Life? A brochure like the 10-20-Life would be good.  I distribute them at all of my events and crime watch meetings.  Carmen


House Bills 1393, 1395, 1397, 1399, and 1401 will re-enact the portions of the Three-Strike Violent Felony Offender Act of 1999.  The law requires mandatory prison terms for felons who commit a third violent felony within five years, drug traffickers, repeat rapists, and other violent criminals who violently assault law enforcement officers and people over 65 years old.  In addition to providing tough, mandatory prison terms, these five bills require public-service announcements explaining these mandatory prison sentences to advise the public and would-be violent criminals of the punishment they will receive if they commit these crimes

Subject:	Re: DS Handbook (edit Version)

Dear Arlene,

Thank you for your thorough revision of the DS Handbook draft and for providing excellent suggestions.  Your suggestions have prompted me to take advantage of this opportunity to share with you and others my son's and my own personal experience with the Department in Miami (District 11), which has been so negative that I cannot help but remember how nice our lives used to be prior to the Home and Community Based Services Waiver.  While my son has been fortunate enough to meet some excellent professionals as support providers, our experience has been negatively impacted by Best Buddies, a provider of supported employment services.  Ironically, Best Buddies is a company that profits under the pretense that it helps individuals with developmental disabilities.  Best Buddies disregarded my son's disability when taking disciplinary action against him.  My son was terminated from his job at Best Buddies 11 months ago at the same time that Best Buddies suddenly and unfairly terminated his supported employment services without any due process rights.  The Department has allowed Best Buddies to discriminate against my son, to violate his rights, and the Department has participated in intentional discrimination against the very same client that they were supposed to be protecting.  Of course, Best Buddies is much more powerful than my son and I could ever be.  The Department watched in silence while we have continued to request assistance from those in the supervisory capacity to investigate our allegations and to order a change.  However, the Department refused to act on the knowledge and engaged in deliberate indifference, both considered intentional discrimination under the law.  The Department chose to ignore the truth and accepted false statements provided by Best Buddies and by my son's previous independent support coordinator, who hiding behind her incompetence as an independent support coordinator, found it easier to join Best Buddies in the discrimination than to face the truth of her own incompetence and neglect for her own client.  The Department and those in the supervisory capacity that could have chosen to stand by the truth and do something about it have demonstrated the same level of incompetence, negligence and intentional discrimination against my son.

Regarding the provision of supported employment services, it is my opinion that the Department allows many of the providers of this critical service to continue to treat clients, not as clients, but as second class citizens, and to continue the previous trend of placement in sheltered workshops (or "sweat shops" as I and others call them) while being funded as providers of supported employment services.  It has been our experience that the funding for supported employment services is misused by many of these providers and the supported employment services are not provided in a manner that is individualized and in community-based competitive employment settings.  

It is sad to see that no matter how much money is appropriated for Home and Community Based Services Waiver, in my opinion, the culture of the Department continues to be one of "give the client a fish so that he can eat for one day, rather than teach the client how to fish so that he can eat for the rest of his/her life."  There is no initiative, no creativity, no coordination of services, no entrepreneurial ideas for individuals with disabilities and no true goal for independence.  Quite the contrary, it seems that the goal continues to be "dependence."

It is my opinion that it is important for those who have loved ones with developmental disabilities to be fully aware that the Department rarely acts in a manner that would protect the health, safety, and/or welfare of a client. Quite the contrary, for the first time in my life, after my son is almost 25 years of age, I am considering obtaining some type of limited guardianship mainly to protect my son from the Department or, in the alternative, get as far away from the Department as we possibly can! It is also my opinion, based in our own personal experience, that the Advocacy Center for Persons with Disabilities, Florida's "protection and advocacy" agency, is rarely interested in the rights of individuals with developmental disabilities, especially in the area of access to supported employment and protection from discrimination.  It makes me sick to think what happens to those clients who have no one who can speak on their behalf, no one who can defend their rights and no one to turn to, so we pray for those individuals with disabilities and their families every night. Fortunately for my son, that's not his case and no one will ever silenced us.

Thank you again,

Dear Governor Bush:

Please lead our state legislature in adequately funding the Transportation Disadvantaged Trust Fund.  Ask the senate to pass the house version of S.B. 100 and ask both houses to ratify the House position on line item 2102.  Then ask them to approve E - 69 and E - 70.  As our population ages, traffic gets more congested, more aged people become disabled, these measures are more needed than ever.  The TD program is the only affordable transportation available for many of our state's residents so they can access health care, job training and paid employment.  Lack of such service only costs tax payers more money with increased Medicaid expense and nursing home expense.

Thank you.

Governor Bush, my heart is heavy and my prayers are with all that are 
involved with this missing child. The added news as many as 450 may not be 
able to be accounted for is also devastating. This is an exceptional burden 
to try to unravel, and separate facts and fiction and find solutions quickly.

These same kind of problems, exist in all other area's of DCF as well as in 
Foster Care. The Governor's Commission Report on Mental Health and Substance 
Abuse has documented this across Florida, reporting from Consumers, Families, 
Professionals. Many Mental Health Advocate's have shared their concerns with 
you, that the System is not working, for far too many of Florida's most 
vulnerable, children (who are mentally ill, in foster care, adoptions) as 
well as mentally ill adults.

This is not meant to "kick a wounded government body" being besieged by the 
press.
Finger pointing, circling to place blame, is a futile attempt and is unworthy 
of any consideration. 

Please consider this as a vote of support for the proactive action on your 
part to decisively determine the swift bold action this situation demands and 
put it in motion.

                 Sincerely, Jo Heller, Mental Health Advocate

Dear Governor Bush-

Thank you for your recent support of the  FL Voters Reforms you have supported this past legilative session that will addord voters with disability access in upcoming elections.  The other critical line item is funding for Transportation Disadvantaged.  Please encourage the legislators to support the current House Bill.  TD is struggling to survive as ridership increases in all of Florida, with many rural  counties severly underserved as it is. We do appreciate your continual support you have shown in the past for disability legislation for citizwns with disabilities.  Please support us in our work to make Florida a national  "best practice" state in Transportation Servicesfor PWD as well.

 

With sincere gratitude,

with disabilities that one of the programs benefiting them should be
compromised in order to benefit another.  The individuals who receive
the benefits of the Adult Basic Education provided through the Adult
Handicapped Fund are those who will likely never be able to be
competitively employed, and therefore, not able to benefit from VR
services.  In Miami-Dade, approximately 2,863 adults with disabilities
are registered at 25+ agencies.  Each receives an average of 25-30 hours
of educational services weekly.  While we recognize that there are many
competing funding priorities, we urge you NOT to reduce funding for the
DOE's Adult Handicapped Program.

In Brevard County over 329 students are being served daily and trying improve the quality of their lives.   The ABE program instruction advances their skills of self-determination and vastly improves the quality of their lives.  Besides, this is their right as citizens of this state!

In addition, individuals with disabilities must have a place to enhance skills for the rest of their lives and to prepare for supported employment before going to VR for services.  

It is inexplicable why this population's rights must continuously be the subject of the financial climate of the times and constantly be put at risk.  

Brevard County, as a result of the performance-based funding approach started two years ago, is making great strides toward improving and enhancing the self-determination of our ABE clients.  

We have a daughter who is neurologically compromised, and boderline mentally retarded.  ALthough to look at our daughter one might say she is a typically developing teenager.  To speak to her, you may even be deceived at first, however she will never be any older than an 8 year old mentally.  We want her to succeed in life, if  budget cuts come to these programs, our daughter has little chance of success as an adult.  As long as we are alive we will continue to provide for her, but just as many parents fear, what will happen to her after we are gone.  DOesn't our child have a right to dream of a future just the same as any other child?  Without Adult Ed opportunities many children have little hope of being independent or succeeding. 

Please look at your children regardless of their age, imagine every opportunity for them to be successful being challenged.   Imagine your child growing up with  reduced educational opportunities, voc tech programs (that may actually give our children a chance at independence ) being reduced or eliminated.  The future for our children looks pretty bleak:  Reduced educational opportunities/vocational opportunities = no job = no health insurance, no health insurance = no physician care/medication = no chance of survival.  Please, do not reduce our children's  chance for a future, they deserve a fair chance too. 

Thank you.

                RE:  Outreach Funding

Dear Ms. Blalock:

I have served on Healthy Kids, now known as the KidCare Advisory Committee, 
for Sarasota County since the program began.  I also serve now as the Chair 
of the School Readiness Coalition of Sarasota County.

It is terribly frustrating for those of us who are trying to make life better 
for the least of our children when budgets are cut.  What is even more 
frustrating and hard to understand is the expenditure for marketing trinkets 
when dollars are scarce.

The need in Sarasota County is for a full-time KidCare Outreach Coordinator.  
If we really mean to serve needy families, we need to reach out to them with 
knowledgeable human beings.  Things such as clever devices will not do the 
job.  It is one-on-one human contact that will bring families into the 
program.

I am sending copies of this letter to the Governor and our Legislative 
Delegation by email.  The need is great.  Our  elected representatives need 
to make this happen for kids.

Please adequately fund the KidCare Program so that Outreach Coordinators can 
serve our families.

                    Thank you.

Dear Jeb,
Thank you for your response.  
I still want to reiterate the point that local coalitions have been given the authority to construct the delivery of early care and learning services to eligible children, 0-5 within their locale.  I would not want to negatively disrupt an already underfunded mandate.  It would require an incredible amount of funding, not to mention overall infrastructure, to serve all eligible 4 year olds across the state. This is a commitment that should be made by our state, but not at the expense of younger, eligible children. 

Although I remain optimistic and will  continue to "press" for more funding for the Readiness mandate, I have been made all too aware of the unavailability of the funding required to really make readiness for all children a reality.  It is frustrating, because we know through the brain research and longitudinal studies that we will continue to have children starting kindergarten significantly behind, with odds against them to ultimately "catch up".  We know the cost of social promotion, remediation, juvenile deliquency, drop outs, and crime but can't seem to make the obvious connect.

Thanks, as always, for your willingness to listen and respond.
Your friend, and fan,
Carol

Governor Bush,

It was probably too late in the game when I originally emailed you anyway. It was a week and a half after you requested me to do so. We too have a child in crisis and he was the focus of my attention the week that followed our brief discussion. I didn't get back to you soon enough.

It indeed was not in the budget on either side so will not be part of conference this weekend. I also had received conflicting reports as whether it was or was not there.

It is often the nature of real estate transactions to pop up without enough time to properly move them forward. Fortunately, this is not necessarily a "dead" issue and we can be better prepared for next session. If our intention and proposal is sound it will happen then.

Thank you for your attention and consideration of it.

Dear Governor Bush,
Robert and I very much enjoyed see you in Tampa on the 17th and
especially
appreciated your candid insight into where we are as we move toward
November
5th. We look forward to continuing to work on the successful and
rewarding
effort of your re-election.
As you may recall, we spoke briefly after that meeting about an issue
concerning Hillsborough Community College, for which I serve as a member
of
the District Board of Trustees (currently as chairman) thanks to your
original appointment of me in 1999. You told me you thought it was in
the
current budget but I have been watching very closely and am fairly
certain
it is not there. I recognize that legislation is not my business thought
and
may be missing it.  But staff at HCC also tell me they can't find it
either.
I have attached the talk sheet that has been used for promoting the sale
and
transfer of the W.T. Edwards property to HCC. The talk sheet explains
that
we are asking for a special appropriation to PECO that will enable HCC
to
purchase the property from the Department of Children and Families,
which
will allow them to use to proceeds of the sale to build a sexual
predator
facility.
The property has been recently appraised at approximately $8 million.
Having the appropriation go to the College through PECO puts us in the
drivers seat in closing the sale. Plus, it permits you and the
Legislature
to show additional funds allocated to education, while protecting
Floridians
from sexual predators.
There are precedents for colleges using PECO to purchase state lands and
for
special appropriations to PECO.
I am told we have support of this approach from Amy Baker (CFO of the
Dept.
of Children and Families), and Colleen Castille (your Director of
Cabinet
Affairs)
Again, this appropriation does not appear to be in either the House or
Senate budgets. However, Rep. Murman indicated that she will be on the
look
out for money that becomes available in the closing minutes of the
Session.
I am sure that if we have your support we will attain the appropriation.
It is important to note that we cannot jeopardize any of the College's
existing PECO projects in order to fund this request. In addition, we do
not
wish to reduce the community college system's PECO appropriation in
order to
fund this request.
Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions. Thank you
for
your attention and support of this matter.

Yours truly,

Nancy

'All I want is to graduate'

By April Hunt
Sentinel Staff Writer

May 4, 2002

ST. CLOUD -- Since August, Joey Meyer has awakened with the vision of walking triumphantly across the stage this spring and grasping his high-school diploma.

His parents had struggled to motivate their 17-year-old son with Down syndrome to enjoy school. So they prodded him to do his schoolwork by reinforcing how proud he would feel balancing a mortarboard on his head and donning the maroon-and-golden gown along with the rest of the St. Cloud High School Class of 2002.

Joey kept up his end of the bargain, but school district officials say there has been an unfortunate mistake -- he doesn't have the credits to graduate. They say his parents misunderstood the requirements, and the school regrets it didn't catch the mix-up sooner.

The bottom line: Joey won't be marching to "Pomp and Circumstance" on May 20 at Disney's Wide World of Sports.

Now, disappointed and bewildered, Joey has been sitting in a lawn chair under a beach umbrella on his front lawn across from East Lake Tohopekaliga and protesting the turn of events. A homemade sign pleads "Let Joe Graduate" and urges passing motorists to "Honk for Joey." When they do, he waves and smiles, but the smile is a dimmer version of the one in the photo of him in graduation garb.

"All I want is to graduate. It has been hard," said Joey, who sips iced tea to ward off the heat and takes breaks to play with his skateboard.

Many cars that stream past his Lakeshore Boulevard home blare their horns. Others stop in front of the historic 1914 home to get the full story. When he is feeling hopeful, Joey yells to supporters, "Vote for me."

His parents Bob and Sharon Meyer have assured him he is not being punished for something he did wrong. Still, Joey doesn't understand what has happened.

His parents paid the $40-plus to rent the cap and gown. His photo in graduation attire will appear in the Bulldogs' school yearbook, and his name is included on the T-shirts listing the senior class.

"In his eyes, we lied to him," said Bob Meyer, who made the sign when Joey originally wanted to picket at the school. "He is so hurt by this whole thing."

Osceola County School Superintendent Blaine Muse said he is sympathetic and admitted that school officials are partly to blame. Last fall, the district sent home a standard letter to Joey's parents, reminding them that special-education students who attended school for four years, earned the required credits and were at least 18 could participate in graduation in the spring.

Bob Meyer sent the form back, saying Joey, who turns 18 on May 14, would graduate this year. School officials, however, didn't realize until two weeks ago that Joey didn't qualify because he is four credits shy of the 22 required credits and has only been at the school for three years.

Muse said because of that, the school and Joey's parents share the blame. But, he added, it isn't enough to persuade him to alter school policy for just one student.

"The other students are walking because they met the requirements. He did not," Muse said.

The Meyers argue that an official could change their son's individual education program so he could participate in the ceremony. After all, they said, Joey doesn't need the diploma. He isn't going on to college or applying for any jobs where he will need those credits, they said.

That is why they support their son when he says he won't go back to St. Cloud High next year. It will be hard enough to get Joey, who has been out sick twice this week with a virus, to finish this year, his parents said.

That response doesn't surprise Sylvia Smith, an official with the Advocacy Center for Persons with Disabilities in Tallahassee. Smith, who is reviewing a complaint from the Meyers against the school district, said it is critical for teens with disabilities to be able to plan for their future.

All teenagers are still defining how they will fit into the world at large. But for a student like Joey, that work requires a lot more planning by parents and the school, to make sure they realize they will have a place by earning it.

"It is such a critical time," Smith said. "It sounds like a cruel practical joke."

Joey has been so sick and upset that his mom and dad fret he may not feel better for tonight's prom at the Wyndham Palace Hotel, even though some of the girls in his class have promised to save dances for him.

And his parents worry that Joey will refuse to attend graduation to see his sister Tiffany, who has cerebral palsy and has been in the special-education program as well, get her diploma.

"They're taking from him something that is so important," said Bob Meyer, who then asked his son what he thinks.

"I want to graduate," Joey answered with a shrug. "I just want to graduate."

"No End In Site" is the title of an article at

The article details one of the most outrageous ongoing
betrayal of public trust in Florida history. It also
clearly demonstrates that Gov. Jeb Bush needs to
immediately step in to address these issues before
more violence erupts. 

The Gov has not responded to requests for his
intervention. A special prosecutor should immediately
be appointed. 

Read it and see for yourself.

Dear Governor Bush:

Sorry to have missed you at Adams Ranch event last week. 

Since that time, I've been tending 24/7 to an orphaned 3-week old dolphin
calf... who lost his mom in the Indian River Lagoon. 

He continues to do well and has learned quickly to nurse from a bottle,
rather than the stomach tube. He's gaining about a pound a day. 

We expect to have him here at Harbor Branch Critical Care Pool for another
week, while he gets medical clearance. 

From here, I expect to place him at another facility with lactating females
that can better provide for his social and nutritional needs.  

Jim Harvey stopped by and we really appreciate the JEB hats. The attached
image says it all.

Wyland also sends his regards from Kona, Hawaii... sorry he could not make
the (Protect Florida Whales) bill signing next week. He wanted me to tell
you that he hopes to meet with you this November when he returns to Florida.

Dear Governor Bush:

Sorry to have missed you at Adams Ranch event last week. 

Since that time, I've been tending 24/7 to an orphaned 3-week old
dolphin
calf... who lost his mom in the Indian River Lagoon. 

He continues to do well and has learned quickly to nurse from a bottle,
rather than the stomach tube. He's gaining about a pound a day. 

We expect to have him here at Harbor Branch Critical Care Pool for
another
week, while he gets medical clearance. 

From here, I expect to place him at another facility with lactating
females
that can better provide for his social and nutritional needs.  

Jim Harvey stopped by and we really appreciate the JEB hats. The
attached
image says it all.

Wyland also sends his regards from Kona, Hawaii... sorry he could not
make
the (Protect Florida Whales) bill signing next week. He wanted me to
tell
you that he hopes to meet with you this November when he returns to
Florida.

Subject: FCAT/Drug Czar


Dear Governor Bush:

During my research on DARE,  I discovered a speech by your drug czar, James McDonough, to District School Superintendents.  The speech was given on Thursday, March 7, 10:45am at the Ramada Inn North according to the information provided by the following website when searching McDonough.  http://www.myflorida.com/myflorida/government/governorinitiatives/drugcontrol/presentation.doc  The final paragraph of his speech is as follows:

Closing

"Our job is not to pass more work to you or your teachers.  We are cognizant of the demands and pressures in your classrooms.  And yet, we are together responsible for the growth and healthy development of our children.  We are working with you.  That is why I have asked the Department of Children and Families, Health and Education to work cooperatively to develop alcohol and other drug, tobacco and violence prevention and education passages for consideration in the preparation and test materials for the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test (FCAT).  This is a statewide activity and a specific strategy recommended in the Florida Prevention System:  A Vision for the Prevention Component of the Florida Drug Control Strategy.  The work on this has begun, and we expect to begin delivery by 2004."

Although we do not have a problem with a proven or promising drug awareness/prevention program, we became somewhat concerned when we learned drug prevention questions are to be placed on a test children must pass in order to graduate.  After our local school district taught our elementary school aged child where to inject heroin to avoid detection we pulled her from the "drug prevention education" being provided in this area.  We have always spoke to our kids about the ill effects of drugs and bad choices but our instruction  might not match the "correct" answers on the FCAT.  We cannot agree with the state testing children on drug prevention, particularly on a test which is supposed to measure academic achievement.  
       But even putting our disagreement with Mr. McDonough on the matter of FCAT drug prevention testing aside, recent history leads me to honestly say that we would not trust DCF to design a drug prevention test for our children.  
       We strongly support you. We also support accountabililty but frankly, based on  history, DCF appears to be a dysfunctional department with an accountability deficit.   
       Because of our concerns, we would greatly appreciate it if your could ask your staff to obtain a sample of  FCAT questions for different grade levels. 

Respectfully,
Shannon and Scott Knox

Dear Gov. Bush,

Just as thousands of citizens in this state, including me, have discovered
firsthand,
your official bio on www.myflorida.com is quite accurate in  describing you
as an
"accessible governor."

As you know, I have emailed you on a number of issues,
usually concerning education, since that happens to be my primary interest,
speaking as a FL certified teacher.

However,  I am emailing you now because I am still pondering the theme of
the following thread.   Such theme seems to me to be:
"Issues do not really matter to FL voters "  --

http://www.FreeRepublic.com/focus/news/677994/posts

I disagree with the above essay and theme, because I personally know FL
voters who
are voting for you -- for the first time ever -- because of your outstanding
record as governor.

And, they are voting for you regardless of who turns out to be your
opponent.  I'm referring
specifically to registered Dem and independent  FL voters I know, teachers
and seniors and others,
who are all enthusiastically following your accomplishments as governor.

If you have any thoughts on the above essay that you would like to publicly
share,
please know that I would be happy to post your thoughts, as you could be a
guest columnist for Part 15 in my editorial series about you. I will
publicly post this email
and any response from you as my Part 15.

I make this offer to you because I truly believe people who read my
editorial series
are very much interested in knowing the facts.

And, some of those people might appreciate hearing directly from you, so
they will have
more facts at their disposal in making informed decisions -- whatever they
decide.

Thank you for considering my offer.

Sincerely,
Susan

Governor,
I am glad you are concerned about the uninsured in this state, as the Miami Herald states. Because if this Heathcare Bill is allowed to stand...I will be one of the uninsured, as well as thousands of other presently insured, hard working, taxpaying, self-employed citizens. 
 
If the issue is covering small business' medical needs -- that's an industry problem. If small businesses are being formed by sick people just to get small-business rates, why has the industry so aggressively sought our business, and still seek our  business? The insurance industry has enough remedies under current law to deal with this issue without putting the gun in our elected officials' hand and asking them to pull the trigger.

 
I can't see how throwing thousands of otherwise insured people out on the street will reduce the number of uninsured in this state.
I will be the first one to tell you Governor, this state needs insurance reform, it needs its uninsured covered, but like any doctor oath's, lets make sure we first do no harm in our solution to these problems.
 
 
Governor, if you allow this bill to stand, please advise me on your justifications....I will need to weight them closely for my own peace of mind if for nothing else.

Subject: Patient Self Referral Act
Importance: High


 
Dear Governor Bush:  
 
As you may be aware, our community has been greatly concerned with the proposal by the Legislative to restrict Kidney Dialysis labs.  The Patient Self Referral Act, which was defeated during the regular session, is now being forwarded to you for signature.  From the City's perspective, this bill is poor public policy.  There is no other state that seeks to restrict a company from owning labs as well as clinics, because they like some care about what is actually in the patient's best interests.  
 
Before signing this bill, the City of DeLand would encourage you to hear both sides of the story by contacting DaVita Labs in DeLand.  Hear from them first hand what the lobbyist, who pushed this bill through, have neglected to tell the Legislature.  Please Governor, almost 300 jobs will be eliminated by the stroke of your pen; we are counting on you!.  I would encourage you to contact DaVita Labs and talk to Michael Haun, President or Maria Torres, Vice-President.  They can be reached at (386) 738-1809.
 
Thank you for your time and consideration!

Subject:	Disability Presumption

  
Governor:
 
There are two other issues which DeLand would request that you consider our position, in addition to the Patient Self Referral Act.  
 
Transportation Outreach Program
It goes without saying that the process this year had some flaws.  However, those of us who were ranked by the TOP Advisory Council only followed the process dictated by the Legislature and as such would ask that they honor it this time around before changing it.  In short, we are seeking $400,000 to help fund an Inter-modal Transit Facility in DeLand.  This 4000 square feet facility would accommodate both short and long haul transit, serve as the west-side super stop for VOTRAN, and feed into the commuter rail proposed by Congressman Mica.  The $400,000 would be combined with a City match and $2,000,000 that Congressman Mica is seeking for us at the federal level and has been included in the House Transportation Appropriations Bill.
 
Disability Presumption for Municipal Law Enforcement Officers
Soon, the Legislature will send to you for signature CS/CS/SB 108.  As you are no doubt aware, rising costs in the insurance market have caused a significant increase in premiums.  As we work with our employees to resolve their work-related injuries, we always have their best interest at heart.  However, we feel strongly that their injuries and consequently the benefits awarded should be based upon the weight of the evidence and not a presumption that heart disease and hypertension are job related.  Therefore, we would request that you veto this bill and asked the Legislature to try and better define the problem (if there is one) and come up with solutions that are more focused and in the best interest of everyone (i.e. the public at large, the City, and the police officers)  and not just one constituent group (the unions).  
 
Thanks again for your time and consideration on a Sunday!  mpp

		I have a number of ideas and strategies that I would recommend that center around moving to CBC quicker and streamlining the DCF state office to be a top notch oversight group.  To get the community folks much more involved and invested through faith based and corporate initiatives.  To doing a comprehensive review of current case status.  To bring in the courts, prosecutors and law enforcement to be more aggressive in prosecutions and to blend their activities more with DCF to avoid duplication and assure full and updated knowledge.  And I have more.
		 
		I personally think that Secretary Kearney is doing a great job.  She needs help, she needs to let some of us help her.  Let me know if I can be of any service.  We are on the right path.  We can do better, together.  Our children deserve the full force of the compassion that rests in the hearts of our citizens, it is there and it is powerful.

Dear Governor Bush:
There is a bill before you at this time to all anyone to fly a flag anyway they please without any restriction or standards by Homeowner Association. I plead with you to not take away the Homeowner Associations right to set standard's of how the flag can be displayed. No one wishes to deny any citizen the right to fly the American Flag, but I do think an Association has the right to set standards for how the flag is to be displayed in a respectful way. 
No doubt you have, and will again live in a community with Deed Restriction. This is something we choose to do, and in those restrictions we decide how certain things will be done in our community. By choice. Get the picture? Therefore, I ask you to veto the bill to allow anyone to fly a flag any way they choose, if they live in a Deed Restricted Community.

unsuccessful run for governor against Gov. Childs, and when you finally
won the seat 4 years ago. But frankly I have been very disappointed in
your performance. Especially as it pertains to the Manatee issue in
Brevard County. Your actions have directly affected my home values and
my quality of life. I find it amusing that the left is slamming your
environmental record, despite the fact that you threw them the Florida
Marine Industry, in the name of the manatee. I want you to know that I
will not vote for you, but I will not vote for your democratic opponent
either. For the first time since I was 21 years of age my vote for
Governor of this state will be blank. From what I have heard from
friends and family, you stand a very good chance of losing Brevard
County, one of your strongholds. I believe that it is time that you
stood behind members of the Marine Industry...on the unemployment line. 

Sincerely, 

Edward N. Ryan Jr. CET CIT

Subject: This is My Documentation on My Problem I Told You I Had!


Dear Governor Jeb, Sir,
 
    As I've seen you on T.V. lately, discussing your daughter's illness, I have cried TEARS along with you about your own daughter's problem. I truly understand, Sir, like you, how horrible it is to FIGHT a long-going, seemingly never-ending condition of one you love so much! 
 
     As I shared with you in an earlier message, I'm still dealing with the my oldest daughter, Virginia "Ginger" Bryan Martin, whose case you had investigated for me in 1998.  Ginger was diagnosed as bi-polar/manic depressive--our problem here just happens to be mental illness, COMPOUNDED by how inept Children & Families and the Polk County court system handles this type of abuse cases by REPEATEDLY just SENDING THE KIDS BACK "HOME" TO BE DAMAGED MORE!!
 
     My younger daughter, Julie (Bryan) Harter, (a/k/a "Lady Gator Trapper" and high school teacher) whom you met, keeps reminding me, 
 
"Mama, Jeb said for you to let him know IF HE COULD HELP, SO JUST SEND IT--and just see if HE can do anything for us to help these kids!!"  I then remind her about just how BUSY you already are!!
 
     Sir, I apologize ahead of time for any errors, the long length of this narrative and over emotional wordings because it has taken all night since 2 Sunday afternoon to get this ready for you. The injustice of the system has been a wrenching experience on me for years as I see how the cases of children--mine as well as many others--have been so MISHANDLED!!
 
    THANK YOU, in advance, for placing this in your ombudsman's hands. Ours Sir, is AN EXTREMELY BAD, COMPLICATED MESS that needs INVESTIGATING!!  I would not be writing you like this again, if this were not the case. It is with much personal agony that I write these facts, as I know believe them to be, to you!
 
     Please, call me, if I can answer any questions as someone tries to digest all this. My home number is: (863) 858-8792,  Work at Sleepy Hill Middle School: (863) 815-6577 Ext. 249, and my Cell: (863) 944-1894.
 
     I've attached my Education Vita to this document so your ombudsman can check out my credibility, and also there are attached some documents telling the history of the most recent events.
 
     I'M REALLY AT A LOSS ON JUST WHAT TO DO NOW--TODAY--BECAUSE I was just told by the case worker yesterday (Sunday) afternoon, that there's a COURT SESSION AT 1 P.M. TODAY,  Monday 6th, to decide the FOSTER HOME PLACEMENT for MY GRANDDAUGHTER, AMANDA ELLEN MARTIN, who just turned 14 May 1st.  
 
     I have called in for a substitute at school today and will be calling around to see IF I CAN POSSIBLY GET AN ATTORNEY ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE for the 1 P.M. hearing! This will possibly mean me having to refinance my home again, but after you read my session with Judge Strickland later in this document, you'll understand why I just can't make myself go before him again without an attorney to speak for me.
 
    Amanda (and the other kids) have ENDURED (for the last FOUR YEARS and ELEVEN MONTHS--since they were put back with their mother the SECOND TIME) the constant physical, mental, and emotional abuse and NEGLECT from their bi-polar/manic depressive mother, until Amanda is incorrigible, very sexually active and a repeated "run-away"! 
 
    Now, the Department is just "BOUNCING" her from place to place when Amanda needs intense, straight-forward discipline blended with LOVE!  
 
    IMPORTANT:  C & F's pattern is to just continue to "Bounce" this type kid from Foster Home to Foster Home until they "age-out" of the system--and I won't have that for these kids WHO WERE DOING WELL here with me, until the Foster Care system returned them to "mom" to be destroyed!!
 
      Governor Sir, I keep telling the Department of Children and Families that Amanda needs to be in a special facility until she can get the mental health/Christian counseling that she so DESPARATELY NEEDS to get "back on track" BEFORE SHE BECOMES PREGNANT--and there's another baby to deal with! 
 
     This WAS a wonderful, good child who loved her Lord and was a pleasure to all who knew her when she lived here. C & F keeps telling me that "there are no facilities to help children like this, but regular Foster homes", since Cornerstone, (a non-lock-up girl's facility below Mulberry with NOT MUCH LEADERSHIP and a BAD reputation), now refuses Amanda since she also  ran from there last week and was missing for TWO and ONE-HALF DAYS.
 
     I gave the C & F Protective Services Investigator case worker, Mr. Charles Brantley, all the information on "POTTER'S HOUSE" in Lake Placid, FL.  It is a state-approved facility, run by a Christian couple that has a VERY HIGH SUCCESS RATE with incorrigible, run-aways, and even pregnant young girls! Potter's House also faxed their information to Mr. Brantley.  But, I can't get him to call there to see IF they can help Amanda--instead of moving here from foster home to foster home.
 
     I have now been RESTRAINED from being able to HELP my grandchildren, even though they have been placed in MY CUSTODY THREE TIMES in their young lives and these kids have lived here, on my farm with me successfully for over 6 years of their childhood!  I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS!!
 
    Just as before when the system WORKED AGAINST ME TO SEND THESE KIDS "HOME"--THE BOTTOM LINE IS MONEY!!  They don't want their budget to be eaten up with kids like these who have MENTAL ILLNESS in their backgrounds!!  Kids who need lots of counseling and mental meds ARE expense to raise! It all boils back to DOLLARS!  Also, Ginger seems to have the uncanny luck to keep getting by doing so many things that others can't get by with.  
 
     Since Mr. Brantley had repeatedly told me at 7 P.M. last night that "we can't keep her in Juvenile Detention--even to stop her from running away and being on the streets and possibly getting hurt.  Since she has NO criminal charges against her that would be violating Amanda's civil rights because we have no criminal grounds to hold her on. 
 
     During that phone call, I told Mr. Brantley, "I'm fed up with the Department just passing this kid around, I'm really to WRITE GOVERNOR JEB BUSH AND/OR I'm going to call Channel 8 in Tampa and provide them with the necessary information to do an "Investigative Report" on my grandchildren's situation."
 
    Then, magically, three hours later at 10 P.M. Mr. Brantley called me back to inform me that "Amanda WAS being held at Juvenile Detention!"  Even though I was glad that she wouldn't be living on the streets and running again--for last night at least, I couldn't understand their SUDDEN CHANGE so that now Amanda would stay in Juvenile Detention! Brantley went on the explain that "Amanda does have a criminal charge of "lewd sexual behavior" on her AND it's also on the young boy that she had sex with who also was 13 years old at the time of the incidents, LAST JULY!!"  
 
     Mr. Brantley had to tell me this several times because I just didn't understand it! If there was NO criminal charge on her at 7 P.M. from last July, HOW could there be one on her at 10 P.M.??  Brantley went on to say that Amanda would "go before a judge at 8 o'clock Sunday morning."
 
    As I went to church Sunday morning, I called Mr. Brantley's cell phone to see what the 8 A.M. judge did.  He said the judge RELEASED Amanda into his (Brantley's) care FROM the Detention Center and he was now in his office, trying to find a foster home placement for her! I got angry and asked IF they couldn't hold her because there was NO criminal charges at 7 P.M., and then how did they "FIND" the criminal charges on the computer by 10 P.M. last night so they COULD hold her in J.D.?  HOW could a judge OVERLOOK those same charges in this morning's hearing and not retain her in Detention?  He grew frustrated with my questions and said, "I don't know, we may 'get it' from the District Attorney's office on Monday morning, but right now, I've just got to find a place for Amanda to stay!"
 
    Later, as I came home from church yesterday (Sunday) afternoon, I called Charles Brantley again.  He was STILL in his office looking for a Foster Care dependency placement for Amanda. He said Amanda was asleep there in his office and she did spend the night in Juvenile Detention.'' 
 
     I asked him if he had ever made the call to Potter's House.  He said, "No!  Amanda's right here, it would be difficult to talk with them with her in the room."  I said, "May I speak to Amanda?"  He answered, "Well, she's asleep."  I said, "Well, now would be a good time to go to the next office and call Potter House, wouldn't it?"
 
     This time, I just LOST IT!  I said, "You folks must THINK that I'm really stupid! I'm begging you to hold Amanda in a lock-up facility to KEEP HER SAFE AND UNPREGNANT until she gets some counseling because she's continually running away for sex on the streets.  You say, 'Can't do!'  Then, criminal charges pop-up on a computer screen at 10 P.M. when it's time for you all to go home and you haven't found her a "placement"? You are just covering your butts, so IF I get a MEDIA investigation going on about all this 'flipping kids around in family foster homes', you can say, "A JUDGE DECIDED THAT AMANDA IS TO BE PLACED IN A FOSTER HOME--NOT C & F." (which, by the way, she'll run from anyway--SHE'S told you that and done that now, several times!).  But, really YOU HAVE PLACED her in a foster family home, BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT STRINGS TO PULL and WHEN to pull up WHAT on a computer, but you make it LOOK like a judge decides--but you feed him the info he uses to make his decisions!!  That disgusts me!"
 
    Governor, I want to state something very clearly...Mr. Charles Brantley IS the best of ALL the many C & F workers I've had to deal with since 1991 while I've TRIED to protect and rear these children!  I believe he is being "pulled in many directions" with trying to do what is right while, at times, having to dance to the dictates of his superiors!  I do believe he has my grandchildren's best interests at heart.  
 
     I have told Brantley all along that "THE DEPARTMENT WILL AT SOME POINT, PULL YOU BACK MR. BRANTLEY FROM FULLY USING THE INFORMATION YOU'VE GATHERED IN INVESTIGATING THIS HORRIBLE CASE. BECAUSE TO PROSECUTE MY DAUGHTER TO THE FULLEST EXTENT, WOULD BE THEIR TOTAL ADMISSION THAT THEY WERE WRONG WITH ALL THE WORK THAT THEY DID IN ORDER TO RAM ROD THE FIVE AND ONE-HALF HOURS TRIAL IN JUNE, 1997, that sent these kids back into a hell--THEY WORKED TOO HARD TO ACCOMPLISH REUNIFICATION in 1997, to MAKE A FULL ADMISSION OF THEIR GROSS ERRORS that has and WILL continue to damage my grandchildren's lives permanently--THEY WILL NEVER ADMIT THAT!''
 
     Now, let me share with you the events that led up to me NOT EVEN BE CONSIDERED AS A PLACEMENT NOW even though these kids lived here with me successfully for over 6 years of their childhood:
 
I.  On March 14 around 2:00 P.M., Mr. Charles Brantley called me while at was at school teaching in my classroom to say that Amanda (then just 13) HAD TRIED TO COMMIT SUICIDE!  
 
     Mr. Brantley has not only handled complicated Amanda's case, but also investigated several abuses by their mother of her older brother, Jonathan, as well.  We finally got the help Jonathan so badly needed for his "HUFFING" addiction and he is currently adjudicated to the Adolescent Treatment Center near Sea World for mental and drug rehabilitation until he's 19 next January, at least.  
 
     (Note: Amanda and her mother have had MANY VIOLENT PHYSICAL FIGHTS!  Even one with a knife--which was investigated by C & F and Deputies in November of last year! (See attachments for details.)  The result was that, in their wisdom, C & F decided to "ALLOW" Ginger to "let me have Amanda voluntary", but with no paperwork, no Medical Permission for Treatment--nothing, but a verbal agreement, and no way to get the child medical assistance when/if she needed it. Amanda DID come live with me the first three weeks in December. Her grades went from Ds and Fs to As, Bs, and Cs!! But, it all blew up, when I mailed Ginger an AGREEMENT (attached) for her to sign so I would have Permission to get her treated AFTER I discovered that NONE OF THESE FOUR CHILDREN WERE TAKEN TO A DOCTOR OR DENTIST IN THE ALMOST FIVE YEARS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN GONE FROM MY HOME!!  THAT IS A CRIME AND TOTAL MEDICAL NEGLECT!)
 
    In his call to my school, Mr. Brantley went on to say that Amanda had skipped school with a boy for MANY days and when Ginger finally decided to do something about it, Amanda cut her wrist with a box blade after she and Ginger fought in Ginger's car in Bartow Middle School's parking lot. She was taken to Crisis Stabilization by ambulance on Wednesday, March 13. Mr. Brantley said Amanda was still in Crisis Stabilization Unit in Bartow and he had to PLACE her somewhere. He asked IF I would take both Amanda and Joshua (16 years old) back into my home for a Shelter Placement? He said C & F had to remove Josh too, because "IF ONE CHILD IS IN DANGER, then of course the other one is also!" He asked if I would not teach the next day and be in the dependency hearing in Bartow at 1 P.M.?
 
    Of course, I said to him, "YES!!", Then I added "but the Department should have never put those kids back in 1997 with my mentally ill daughter from me in the first place, because now all we have is MORE DAMAGED KIDS!!  DO YOU REALIZE THAT THIS IS THEIR THIRD (3RD) TIME BEING LEGALLY REMOVED FROM THEIR MOTHER??  And EVEN THOUGH FOSTER CARE 'CLEANED OUT THEIR FILE ON GINGER' after the kids were sent back the second time so she could GET A TEACHING JOB LAST YEAR, Ginger couldn't hold it because the students got volatile with her!  WHY CAN'T YOU GUYS AT C & F WAKE-UP and see my sick daughter is destroying these children? Are you going to keep putting them back there--UNTIL I BURY ONE OF THEM--OR GINGER??  GOD FORBID!!"
 
    That same night, Thursday, March 14, at 10 P.M., the tired case worker arrived at my home with Josh and Amanda and each had only a backpack of their belongings (to this day "mom" refuses to give them their things and C & F COULD get the law and go in and get these children's personal belongings. Mr. Brantley said he had to get the Sheriff's Department to even help him get Josh and his things out  from my uncooperative daughter at her paramour's (Dave Young, PR man for Bartow Ford) home.  Mr. Brantley said he was sorry that they were getting to me so late at night. He asked did I make arrangements to be in court the next day and I said, "Yes!" 
 
So the kids were actually placed here BEFORE the judge ordered it the next day!
 
II.  On the next day, Friday, March 15, Judge Roger Alcott presided in Juvenile Court.  He asked me from the bench IF he should recuse?  (Because he had been my deceased husband's and my attorney and also HAD BEEN MY DAUGHTER'S ATTORNEY DURING THE 5 AND 1/2 HOURS trial that resulted in the kids being given back to their mother in June, 1997.)  (MANY TIMES I HAVE ALSO WONDERED JUST HOW ATTORNEY ALCOTT WAS ALLOWED to represent Ginger, when he had been my attorney first and was privy to family history information...but it happened!)  I answered, "Yes sir, Judge Alcott, that's exactly what you should do!"
-------------------------------
 
- Now, Governor Jeb, it is important to be able to fully understand the recent events for you to know this history, so you and your ombudsman can understand what's happening in the courts here in Polk County:
 
   A few years back, it was in the paper here that Attorney Roger Alcott was up for your appointing him Judge. I sat at this computer then and decided NOT to write the following information and send it to you, Governor, because I decided to let God above judge Roger Alcott and not "tattle" to you about his early misconduct as a professional that might stop him from becoming a judge. I felt that was the RIGHT THING TO DO for me not to interfere... Never did I dream that I would live to regret that decision!
   
    STORY BEHIND THE STORY:  In the late '70s, Roger Alcott represented my deceased husband and I with some legal matters and we paid him off. Then in the early 1980s, my husband (Thomas C. Bryan, Sr.) was diagnosed with the same mental illness--bipolar/manic depressive--that my daughter Ginger has also been diagnosed with and after much alcoholism and many other problems, Tom divorced me after 27 years of marriage on September 26, 1985. 
 
    Fifty-nine days later, on December 2, 1985, Tom was very drunk as he chased me in his truck and he passed me losing control. I WATCHED IN HORROR as Tom's truck's bumper hit a huge oak tree 16 foot off the ground and then it flipped and killed him. It took me years and years to get beyond the grief of all that!
 
    I began to get attorney bills from Roger Alcott. I called Mr. Alcott's office and said, "Roger, Tom and I paid you off, what is this bill for??"
    Roger answered, "Ellen, months ago, I cleared up some bad checks written by Tom's girlfriend, Betty Fountain, for Tom."
    I answered, "But, Roger, you were Tom and MY lawyer. I didn't even know he had a girlfriend at that time, we were married--and you KNEW that! You have broken your fiduciary with me. This is NOT right!! IF you ever send me another bill for representing my husband's girlfriend, I'll go to the Florida Bar and report you!"
 
    Needless to say, no more bills ever came. 
 
--------------------------
 
Back to March 15, happenings:
 
III.  After Judge Alcott recused, we were told to wait and we all would be told which judge and what courtroom we would go to. At 3:45 we convened in another section of the courthouse with Judge Kornstein presiding. Ginger had a friend with her, Mrs. Shirley Porter, who Ginger asked the Judge to place the kids with--even after they had been moved in with me on Thursday night.
 
   After a short explanation of Amanda's situation by the C & F Attorney, Mr. Lazaro and the case worker, Mr. Charles Brantley, I was quickly given dependency custody of BOTH Amanda and Josh. This was the THIRD TIME in their short lives that they have been placed with me! I leave with a signed "SHELTER ORDER" in my hands.
 
     Mr. Brantley then told me that it was "only a FORMALITY to go back to court again on Monday because Judge Kornstein hadn't been a Juvenile Judge and it had to go through one. He also told me to go to Bartow Middle and Senior High and withdraw both kids on Monday morning so I could put Amanda into my middle school with me and put Josh in high school here. 
 
    So, all weekend, Amanda, Josh and I rearranged their old bedrooms and got used to our new situation on my farm.  We had a lot of catching up to do because the kids have not been allowed to see me much see 1997.  Maybe their birthdays and at Christmas. Amanda had been difficult to deal with on Saturday--she wanted to phone all the boys for hours and didn't like it when I limited her, but Sunday she had settled in and was more like her old self of almost 5 years ago.
 
    Then, at 9:10 P.M. Amanda ran away with a boyfriend who is now having to answer to the court about his actions in this! The Deputies later found her about 15 miles away in the bedroom of this 17 year old boyfriend. The Deputies call me, saying they were taking her to the Lakeland Regional Hospital because the deputies felt that she may still be suicidal. At 4 A.M., she was released to me and we came home to bed.
 
     The next morning, I got someone to stay with Josh and Amanda and left to WITHDRAW the kids from their Bartow schools and to go to the court hearing. After getting all the withdrawal papers for Josh, I ran out of time and couldn't get Amanda's withdrawal then so I went straight to Juvenile Court by 1 P.M.  As I arrived, we were told that Mr. Brantley, the case worker, had TWO cases at the same time period and I really began to get worried. Only he knew all the details on all the kinds of abuses that these kids had endured. WHY WAS HE SCHEDULED FOR COURT IN TWO PLACES AT ONCE??  WOULD HE BE WITH ME, when we were before the judge??
 
(Now, I start to really wish that I wasn't still paying off my big mortgage and that I had a "Cracker-Jack" attorney with me for my representation!!)  
 
     After a wait, we were told to go over into another part of the Courthouse, which was strange, where Judge J. Tim Strickland would be REVIEWING our Shelter Order.
 
   There was only the pertinent parties in the room. No other cases were being heard there. I looked around and couldn't see the usual stenographer or even a recording machine and wondered what kind of record was being kept of this particular hearing. They began, and sure enough, Mr. Brantley, the case worker was NOT PRESENT.  He was still down in the other part of courthouse do the other case scheduled at that SAME TIME. I started to ask Mr. Lazaro, C & F attorney, IF we could wait on Mr. Brantley to begin, but things had begun being said, so I just stood quietly before the bench.
 
    My daughter, Ginger, had an attorney, Mr. John Griffin with her. I wondered how her boyfriend, Dave Young PR man for Bartow Ford, had come up with the money so quickly. (I never believe much Ginger says, but Ginger later confided to her sister that even though Dave had told Ginger for months that he DID NOT WANT HER KIDS THERE ANYMORE, he had cashed in a C D just so Ginger could have representation to fight and prevent ME from getting the kids!)
 
    Mr. Griffin started hammering points showing that they wanted the kids MOVED from me. At this point I began to become physically sick. Mr. Brantley said that this hearing was "just a formality"...what was happening?
 
     I felt a little better when Judge Strickland make the very clear statement that, 
 
     "We're NOT HERE to change the placement of the kids who were just placed with Grandmother on Friday, we are here just to review the Shelter Order."
 
    Mr. Brantley was STILL NOT in the Courtroom and my uneasy feeling would NOT go away. Mr. Griffin kept on about Ginger not wanting the kids with me again. Finally, Ginger stepped forward and handed some papers to Judge Strickland, he concentrated on them for a few minutes.
 
------------------------------
     Now, Governor Jeb, this is the hard part for me to share...This is WHY I've been so unset since March 18th.  THE AWFUL THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN THIS SECTION IS WHAT FINALLY GAVE ME THE DRIVE TO INVOLVE YOU AGAIN IN THIS:
 
    I still don't know EXACTLY what papers Judge Strickland was reading that Ginger handled to him. (I've repeatedly asked Mr. Brantley to ask the Court for clarification to NO AVAIL!!)
 
    I still MUST know WHAT Ginger had that would turn the Judge from me!!  I KNOW I'm an "approved" adult because I teach 106 sixth graders in my classes EACH DAY and teach in a school with over 1,000 students!
 
    IF I'M O.K. for the school system, then what's wrong here?  And WHY won't they tell me the problem?
 
    At Ginger's Arraignment on April 10, they set her abuse on Amanda trial for July 8, and since this her THIRD time around, aren't they planning to Terminate her parental rights?  So, it looks like they would be praying to find someone to take these two troubled kids and finish raising them.  OR, ARE THEY PLANNING ON SENDING THESE CHILDREN BACK FOR MORE??  Again--what's going on here??
 
     (Note:  Mr. Brantley said his investigation was hampered because most of C & F files on Ginger were sorted out or had been tossed out.  He asked me SEVERAL TIMES IF I WOULD BE WILLING TO SHARE what documents I've accumulated through all these years of "court sessions"?  I said, I'd do what you need to help these kids!  So, on April 21, my younger daughter, Julie, and I went to Bartow after school and met with Mr. Brantley at his office with my huge storage tub of documentation since 1991 tracking the abuse cases of Ginger and her ex-husband, Curtiss Martin.  From 5 P.M. until 8 o'clock, Mr. Brantley had me search--especially for items about Ginger's and the kids' mental evaluations over the years.  I took them out of many five-inch notebooks, he copied what he wanted, I put them back into the notebooks and Julie collated his copies chronologically for him.  When we finished working at 8 P. M., he had a stack of copies almost 12 inches high.
 
    As Julie drove us home, Mr. Brantley called, excitedly saying he may have found what Ginger had used against me in court to get the kids removed from my home in March.  I still say that just need to petition the Judge for it.
    
    He thought maybe is was a statement by Judge Curry after the 1997 trial that I "was NOT for REUNIFICATION and was NOT helping the children to get ready for that."
 
   Well, Governor, as a mother, a teacher, grandmother...I will still say that even today.  When there was enough evidence to REMOVE kids TWICE by then...WHAT do people need before that say, "Don't send them home--A CHILD'S BODY??  So, yes--guilty as charged, because as her mother, I KNOW just how sick Ginger is...I'll never be for reunification--can't people see the DISFUNCTION OF ALL FOUR CHILDREN NOW??  Something caused those bad changes when they were doing O.K. with me!
---------
     There is one more possible thing that Ginger's papers MIGHT have been:
 
      Foster Care decided to send the kids back to Ginger only AFTER Dave Young, her paramour appeared on the scene to provide the financial support that Ginger was not able to do. Foster Care had all four kids, Ginger and myself (and maybe Curtiss ? ) evaluated by a psychologist in Winter Haven, named Linda Munro. My evaluation was not very positive.  This was not long after Ginger wanted to divorce Curt and I paid for it, thinking after 17 years of being married to an alcoholic, Ginger would get better when he was out of her life.  Later it was discovered that Ms. Munro had DATED THE CHILDREN'S FATHER IN HIGH SCHOOL, AND HER MOTHER IS BEST FRIEND WITH THE PATERNAL GRANDMOTHER!
______________________________
 
But, Judge Strickland leaned back in his chair and addressing the attendants there in court, he said,
 
     "You know, ALL THIS IS, IS A MOTHER-DAUGHTER FIGHT!"  Still talking to those in the courtroom Strickland mockingly said, "Yes, we can have all these 'mother-daughter' fights...less see now, on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursdays, we can have mother-daughter fights... and then on Fridays...yes, then on Fridays we can have ALL our REGULAR court cases!  Don't you all think that would work out?" 
 
Of course, no one answered...
 
     Governor, Sir, I do NOT have words to tell you how I was feeling! Just writing this to you now, I am crying as I relive it!! I'll always remember looking up at that courtroom ceiling and saying in my mind, "God, are YOU hearing this?? You know my heart, you KNOW my love for Ginger and that the only way I'm able to help her, is to help her kids not be hurt by her in any way. 
 
     Just HOW can this man, who's a JUDGE, MOCK ME like this when he doesn't know all the hurts of the past 19 years I've endured with and because of my daughter? 
 
     He doesn't know the large mortgage I carry here at retirement age.
 
     He doesn't know that I COULD HAVE retired last June, IF I had not chosen to keep these abused grandchildren for SIX YEARS!
 
     He certainly wouldn't recognize how I'm STILL struggling to fight the system who caused them even more hurt--he believes this is 'just a mother-daughter' fight!
 
     WHY and HOW can this judge be doing this, when mere minutes ago he clearly said, "We're NOT HERE to change this placement!"
 
     Mr. Lazaro tried to make a point or two, but it was plain to see that something that the Judge had read had CHANGED his mind. I made myself speak up, determined to try to make him see that poor Joshua desperately needed back on his meds for mental concentration so he could focus in school because WHY would a GIFTED child with a very high I.Q. fail three or four times??
 
    I quoted all of Joshua's bad grades, bad behavior, and about the many morning he was LATE for school, etc., from the withdrawal papers I had just gotten from Bartow High.  I tried to tell Judge Strickland of the MANY days he had missed school or been in the school's in-suspension, etc. The Judge just made light of it, with some comment like, "That's not so bad, do you think?"
 
    Then I said, "Well, Judge, I do know Josh is crying out for help because he's in a very bad situation at home because Josh wrote, F-U-C-K about twenty feet across in the middle of the football field!"
 
     Judge Strickland looked at me with a small smile on his face and said, "Now, don't you think that's just normal for boys to do?" He waited for my answer...I finally managed to say, "No! Sir, as an educator of 31 years, I really DON'T BELIEVE that that is a 'normal' thing for a boy to do!"
 
     IMPORTANT:  Judge Strickland indicated with his arm that I was to hand him the papers in my hand.  He didn't know it was withdrawal papers, he just wanted whatever I had.  I handed them up to the judge.  He looked at them for a minute, then...
 
       As I was still reaching for my papers back with my arm up in the air to grasp them, Judge Strickland asked Mr. Brantley (who had finally came into the courtroom from the other case THAT HAD BEEN SCHEDULED AT THE SAME TIME SLOT IN ANOTHER PART OF THE COURTHOUSE).  
 
      JUDGE STRICKLAND HANDLED MY PAPERS ABOUT JOSH'S WITHDRAWAL TO GINGER'S ATTORNEY, MR. GRIFFIN, IGNORING THAT MY HAND WAS STILL OUT TO GET MY PAPERS BACK!!
 
     Mr. Brantley seemed as astonished as I. The next thing I knew, I heard the Judge questioning Brantley if there was ANOTHER PLACEMENT FOR JOSH AND AMANDA--OTHER THAN MY HOME!  Mr. Brantley mentioned Ginger's friend and the Judge asked if he had done a home study. Brantley said, No. The judge said, "Well, I think you need to get on it, I want them moved today!"  It was then after 4 P.M. 
 
     Governor, I'll always remember looking up and screaming in my mind, "God, WHERE are you?? HOW can this be happening??  These kids NEED STABILITY that ONLY I as their Guardian for over SIX YEARS can give them now!  God, what's happening here...someone's been paid off here...this just isn't right!
 
Then...during the long drive home--to tell my two grandchildren who had just gotten settled back in their bedrooms for over six years for THREE DAYS that Mr. Brantley would be coming for them--shortly--to move them to ANOTHER HOME!  Dear God, I don't think I can do this one!!  
 
Then...insult added to injury:  Mr. Brantley calls after I get home and tell the kids they are leaving me.  He WANTS ME TO BRING THEM TO HIM!  Just WHAT do these people think I'm made of?   
 
Thank God, Julie is still here and she goes ballistic and yells to him on the phone, "Just what else can you guys think of to put my mother through today??  I'll bring my niece and nephew to you!"
 
But, then...when the dust settles...pieces of conversations and bits of isolated facts began to come together:
 
How could Ginger WORK there in this courthouse for several years now--as a paid GUARDIAN for old people with those in authority thoroughly aware of the then TWO times that her four kids had been TAKEN AWAY FROM HER by the Courts??
 
Which one of the players possibly gave Ginger a document that stopped me from being considered as a placement for these kids?
 
WHY would Judge Charles Curry ALLOW GINGER TO be a GUARDIAN and HANDLE THE FUNDS, the LEGAL BUSINESS, AND MAKE MEDICAL DECISIONS FOR MANY OLD PEOPLE in his court knowing all the many ABUSES that Pediatricians, etc. testified in front of him about things Ginger had done to her own children that he heard in that 5 and 1/2 hour trial in 1997 in his Court?
 
Just what role did all this play in MY BEING SHUT OUT OF KEEPING THE KIDS with no clear explanation??
 
Why, at one point early last fall, did Ginger have a man to deliver an expensive electric cart for a disabled person to my house for me to "keep".  In typical Ginger fashion, I had NOT asked for it, she just wanted it kept here.  She left it here for some time, with me constantly sending messages through her sister for her to come get it! (Even though this hurts, I try never to deal directly with Ginger because she can be so cruel and her remarks sting long after she's gone.) Ginger finally indicated "it belongs to one of 'my old ladies', but you might need it some day with your bad knees, Mama."
 
SO WHAT'S GOING ON HERE???????????
 
ARE THE BEST THINGS FOR KIDS BEING UTILIZED BY OUR SYSTEMS??
 
****************
Each of Ginger's four children are troubled and carry mental/emotional problems as follows:
 
1.  Melisa Lynn Martin, Ginger's oldest is nineteen and not working or going to college.  Melisa was in home through Foster Care placement from 9 to 15 years old. Melisa was under several psychiatric and other mental health counselors while in my home and was on several different medications for mental/emotional distrubances.  After being sent back to her mother, Melisa has lived with several men, but she now has a 31 year old alcoholic paramour who has a 12 year old daughter living with his mother. Melisa miscarried his baby back after Christmas.  Thus, Melisa is patterning her life just like her mother's and living with someone because she is not capable of supporting herself.
 
2.  Jonathan "Jon" Curtiss Martin, 18 last January.  He only lived with me for about 6 months when he was turned back to his mother from my home by Foster Care workers although he did make pretty good grades then and was in the Gifted program. Jon was under several psychiatric and other mental health counselors while in my home and was on several different medications for mental/emotional distrubances, including Prozac. While Ginger had him, Jon was in more than 10 drug rehabs for "huffing" different substances in order to--an I quote him, "hurt my mother as she has hurt me!"  C & F investigated several incidents of violence between Ginger and Jon last year and Jon was finally adjudicated dependant by C & F last fall after Ginger moved him into an unfurnished apartment with no furniture.  Ginger's paramour, Dave would not allow Jon to live with them anymore. According to Jon, Ginger refused to give him his Social Security card and other items he needed to get employment--thus Jon began to steal items to support himself and his drug habits. Jon was caught stealing and placed in Juvenile Detention in Bartow last December through January after he ran from THREE adjudicated TEEN CHALLANGE programs! I heard Ginger scream at Judge Prince in January that she was "no longer responsible for Jon and all he needed was jail", then she left the courtroom! Judge Prince then asked me what Jon needed. I said BOTH mental and drug counseling! Jon was finally adjudicated to a mental/drug rehab (Adolescent Treatment Center near Sea World in Orlando) where I visit and write to him now regularly. His counselor, Luz ??, shared with me that Jon is a very disturbed young man and she is very concerned for his future and that Jon has "MANY ISSUES that he needs to settle with his mother, but that Jon refuses to be in any counseling sessions with Ginger at all!"
 
3.  Joshua Lynn Martin, now 16 1/2 was also under mental health counseling while in my placement for over 6 years, and was also on a lot of medications. Joshua was also in the Gifted Program and made good grades while here. He, more than both the girls, FEARED going back to his mom. Josh has FAILED several grades in the 4 years and 11 months he's be back under Ginger's care. Josh ONLY HAS 4 CREDITS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND HE SHOULD HAVE ABOUT 16 BY his age.  Josh has buried all of these hurts internally. I truly worry that he will never be fully functional, and even though very bright, not be able to hold down a job and work. Josh has been dabbling in Witchcraft lately.
 
4.  Amanda Ellen Martin, became 14 last week--and is going on a very street-wise 35! Much of this document has been about Amanda.  All the above descriptions of Amanda are the TOTAL OPPOSITE of the Amanda that left here in 1997.  Amanda was then quiet, settled, well-like by peers and adults and pretty mature for her age.  What a crime has been done to change this child into what she is now! I only pray that a miracle can transpire that will serve to turn Amanda around--to her former self!
 
Thank you to anyone long-suffering enough to read all this mess...
 
I PRAY you can help us before it's totally TOO late fpr any of these children...
 
I am NOT a militant or someone just looking for a cause to beat a drum over. 
 
My "cause" has always been children--for 31 years...but, if I fail my own blood, what possible good can I be to those I teach at school?
 
My grandchildren are my HEART--and America's FUTURE!!  
 
Sincerely yours,
 
Ellen Irene Bryan, as always--a/k/a Your very own Personal Encourager -

Florida Redoubles Effort to Accommodate Aged
By DANA CANEDY
UNEDIN, Fla. ? Evelyn Kusk used to fret about crossing a busy intersection
here on her way to the bank and the grocery store. She is 85 and not as
speedy as she used to be.

"Every time, I'd run even to make it halfway," said Mrs. Kusk, a retired
seamstress from Brooklyn. "I'm getting old, so I don't run that fast."

But Mrs. Kusk has been able to relax a bit lately. In recent months, the
city has begun adjusting its traffic lights to give pedestrians 15 seconds
more to cross the street. It has also been putting in wider sidewalks,
shelters for bus stops and stop signs with bigger, easier-to-read letters.

That is not all. Elderly residents like Mrs. Kusk, who walks and cycles
around town and insists on being independent, can now find emergency call
boxes on sidewalks and a ready supply of church volunteers to escort them on
errands and visits to the doctor. In addition, Mayor Tom Anderson says, a
$1.7 million center for the elderly, largely state-financed, will offer
computer and fitness classes, a dinner theater and line dancing. The city
has also begun providing many low-income elderly residents property-tax
breaks beyond those allowed by the state.

What has gotten into Dunedin (pronounced duh-NEE-din), a town of 35,000 on
the Gulf of Mexico 25 miles west of Tampa?

The answer is that it is in the middle of a half-million-dollar effort to
make life safer, easier and more appealing to people 65 and older. The
reasons have to do partly with some hard generational truths, partly with
enlightened self-interest. 

Dunedin is one of more than 40 Florida communities working to be certified
as "elder ready" under a program introduced in 2000 by Gov. Jeb Bush and the
state's Department of Elder Affairs. The program, Communities for a
Lifetime, is the country's most comprehensive effort to encourage
independent living by older people, whom Dunedin and the rest of Florida
have in abundance.

Communities that meet the program's guidelines will get state help in
marketing themselves to retirees, who will then, the thinking goes, buy
homes there, pay taxes there and stimulate the local economy. 

"Once you explain the concept to people ? that the whole purpose is to allow
elders to remain in their homes with dignity, security and purpose in an
elder-friendly environment ? then it makes sense for a community to begin to
prepare," said Peg Cummings, Dunedin's coordinator.

Cities in Florida and elsewhere have for years been making adjustments for
the elderly, like adding handrails to showers in hotels and, since adoption
of the Americans With Disabilities Act in 1990, ramps to buildings. But
under Florida's program, communities are making comprehensive changes.

"In the 50's, people said, `We need to set up an infrastructure to handle
all these children,' " said Bentley Lipscomb, director of the Florida AARP.
"Well, now it's the reverse."

Florida often confronts issues concerning the aging long before the rest of
the country, and for good reason. By at least one measure, it is the
nation's oldest state: in the 2000 census, its 2.8 million residents 65 or
older accounted for 17.6 percent of its population, compared with 12.4
percent for the nation as a whole. In Dunedin, 40 percent of the residents
are at least 65.

Census projections put Florida's figure at 26.3 percent by 2025, with the
national figure 18 percent.

"Florida is looked at as the incubator as to what the rest of the country
will look like in 20 years," said Terry F. White, secretary of the
Department of Elder Affairs. "Because of this, we need to be better prepared
than the rest of the nation."

To gain "elder ready" status, a city must demonstrate that it has made
changes to help the aged in categories including transportation, medical
services and law enforcement. A city that wins approval will be permitted to
post signs proclaiming itself elder-friendly and receive promotional support
from the state.

Under guidelines issued by the Department of Elder Affairs, the
participating cities themselves assess everything from ambulance response
times to whether the police department trains officers to spot schemes that
bilk the elderly.

The state also encourages communities to look for ways to make everyday life
easier for older people, like asking banks to install A.T.M.'s with large
buttons and encouraging grocery stores to include checkout lanes exclusively
for the elderly.

"This is the most comprehensive program I've heard of," said Charles Jarvis,
chairman of the United Seniors Association, an advocacy group. "When Florida
moves in a particular direction, other states follow." 

Cities seeking certification are permitted to pick and choose among the
state guidelines. 

"This isn't a `one size fits all' state," said Cathy Brown, executive
director of the Council on Aging of St. Johns County, which includes St.
Augustine, one of the participating cities. "The whole point is to have each
community say, `This is what we need in our community.' "

So communities begin by evaluating what changes would most improve the lives
of elderly people locally. St. Augustine has refurbished its senior
citizens' center and added new services there. 

The city also plans to build low-income housing for older residents, and
strengthen in-home services for them, she said.

Other cities, however, are still deciding whether to join the initiative.
But in the cities where changes are already under way, people like Donald
Blades voice appreciation.

"This isn't just elder-friendly," said Mr. Blades, 83, of Dunedin. "It's
just plain friendly."

Dear Governor Bush:

During my research on DARE,  I discovered a speech by your drug czar, James McDonough, to District School Superintendents.  The speech was given on Thursday, March 7, 10:45am at the Ramada Inn North according to the information provided by the following website when searching McDonough.  http://www.myflorida.com/myflorida/government/governorinitiatives/drugcontrol/presentation.doc  The final paragraph of his speech is as follows:

Closing

"Our job is not to pass more work to you or your teachers.  We are cognizant of the demands and pressures in your classrooms.  And yet, we are together responsible for the growth and healthy development of our children.  We are working with you.  That is why I have asked the Department of Children and Families, Health and Education to work cooperatively to develop alcohol and other drug, tobacco and violence prevention and education passages for consideration in the preparation and test materials for the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test (FCAT).  This is a statewide activity and a specific strategy recommended in the Florida Prevention System:  A Vision for the Prevention Component of the Florida Drug Control Strategy.  The work on this has begun, and we expect to begin delivery by 2004."

Although we do not have a problem with a proven or promising drug awareness/prevention program, we became somewhat concerned when we learned drug prevention questions are to be placed on a test children must pass in order to graduate.  After our local school district taught our elementary school aged child where to inject heroin to avoid detection we pulled her from the "drug prevention education" being provided in this area.  We have always spoke to our kids about the ill effects of drugs and bad choices but our instruction  might not match the "correct" answers on the FCAT.  We cannot agree with the state testing children on drug prevention, particularly on a test which is supposed to measure academic achievement.  
       But even putting our disagreement with Mr. McDonough on the matter of FCAT drug prevention testing aside, recent history leads me to honestly say that we would not trust DCF to design a drug prevention test for our children.  
       We strongly support you. We also support accountabililty but frankly, based on  history, DCF appears to be a dysfunctional department with an accountability deficit.   
       Because of our concerns, we would greatly appreciate it if your could ask your staff to obtain a sample of  FCAT questions for different grade levels. 

Respectfully,
Shannon and Scott Knox

Dear Governor Bush, 

The proposed language by the House for school readiness proviso (line 2235) -- last sentence, fourth paragraph regarding prioritizing services for four year olds is well-intentioned in our efforts to meet school readiness goals.  However, there are unintended consequences and its impact on families is detrimental as follows: 


1.  Families who are eligible for services but have more than one eligible child would not be able to receive help for the other children (infants, toddlers, or school-age children).  The impact of that policy decision could prevent a parent's ability to work 
and force some families back on public assistance for the child care priority alone.  Throughout the history of these programs, families have been served as a unit. 


2.  School readiness does not just happen the year prior to kindergarten.  Research supports that the earlier the intervention for high-risk children, the better the outcomes for school readiness.  I know that is your goal as well and we applaud you for that. 


3.  This policy would appear unfair to the thousands of families on the waiting list for care.  We have been averaging over 40,000 eligible children per month. 


Even more critical, however, the priorities as stated in proviso would make children who are at-risk of abuse or neglect THIRD on the list for service!  Given the headlines and criticism about our system of protection for children, this simply doesn't make sense.  Nor do I believe that is your intention, Governor Bush. 


The priority as stated in proposed budget is as follows: 


1.  Children transitioning from welfare. 
2.  Four year olds who are eligible by income. 
3.  Children referred who are at-risk of abuse and/or neglect. 


Governor, please reconsider your support of this proposed proviso language.  We worked diligently to get support of your requested increase for school readiness.  If we had been successful, this would make sense.  And we sincerely thank you for your efforts to secure new dollars.  However, with over 40,000 eligible children on the waiting list, I fear for the safety and well-being of at-risk children in our state as well as the damaging effect this has on families with more than one eligible child. 


I know you care about children and I appreciate your support of school readiness.  Please reconsider.  Thank you Governor. 


Sincerely, 


Phyllis Kalifeh

Our View
Politics at its best 
WEST BAY: The vision takes shape.

From Congress on down, elected officials tend to focus on the moment. They're bored stiff by the kind of policy tree-plantings in which the fruits ripen on some successor's watch. Their calendar doesn't go past the next election - nor, often, does the electorate's patience. 
So this week when the Bay County Commission approves the broad draft of a 100-year West Bay sector plan, assuming it does, the public service most exalted by civics textbooks will be on rare display. 
The document is a long-term agreement between regulators and the regulated - in this case the County Commission, which makes land-use rules, and the St. Joe Co., which owns virtually all the land. 
They're saying that to the best of their knowledge, this is the most responsible development vision they can imagine for a time when they're all dead. 
The plan before the commission on Tuesday is responsible. It promotes land uses not only compatible with each other, but with regional growth trends, with a wondrous environment and habitat, and with job-creating industrialization contingent on a new regional airport. 
Sector planning is a new concept in Florida. To see if works, the Legislature authorized five local governments statewide to adopt the broader planning framework as pilot projects. The plan drafted by St. Joe and the County Commission faces still more refinement this summer. Then it must pass muster with the state Department of Community Affairs. Eventually, though, the state and county will have the same vision for West Bay's 78,000 acres. 
Some changes will be necessary over time. No one can really imagine a hundred years off. St. Joe's most realistic projections encompass only the next quarter-century. By then, the new airport and adjacent industry would be in place, as would some low-density residential development and a network of controlled-access roads. 
Future commissioners can't be prohibited from attempting piecemeal changes in trade for immediate political gain. But they will do so in the knowledge that they chip away at Bay County's dream. 
One way to imagine the future is to change the past. Imagine if Panama City Beach had been developed under such far-sightedness; 25 years is a short time compared to the changes that come within that time. 
The West Bay model is not easily adopted by others, however. Cooperation of the property owners - or owner, fortunately, in the West Bay process - makes the work so much easier and not heavy-handed. A joint effort on the heavily plotted beach likely is impossible to achieve in a meaningful way. 
Nonetheless, the West Bay plan demonstrates that the best interest of property owners and the best interest of the larger community really can be the same. In this case, the same can be said for politics.

Thanks Reed.  Our good roadmap is provided by Governor Bush and, like you,
we move at light speed to follow it.  It is challenging, invigorating, and
rewarding and we wouldn't have it any other way.  Your good words about
Florida, both in its proactive business environment and state leadership,

Dr. Perez presents a self serving view of our meeting.  We do not dispute
that "saw palmetto extract" is effective in relieving the symptoms of BPH.
However, potential savings for Medicaid are not in the millions of dollars
since total spending for approved drugs in this category only represents
about two million and we get good rebates on these.  There could be some
savings but these should not be overstated.  Dr. Perez' specific formulation
may or may not offer improvement over other saw palmetto products.

Making payment for a product marketed as a nutritional supplement is
potentially problematic in that other marketers would insist on equal access
to Medicaid funding for their various "nutitional supplement" products with
disclaimed but clearly medical treatment marketing intent for everything
from headache and depression to cancer.  In addition, these products do not
have NDC (national drug code) listings which are required for claims
processing.  HIPAA will prohibit assignment of local billing codes and
require use of NDC's for claims processing later this year.  There are
dozens of products marketed with a "nutritional supplement" disclaimer that
make a variety of health benefit claims, some with some documentation and
others with only anecdotal support, but none with FDA approval.

Subject: Coverage of Urinozinc-Prostahelp, dietary supplement for the
prostate by Medicaid


May 3, 2002
 
Honorable Governor Jeb Bush
Tallahassee, Florida
 
Dear Jeb:
 
On May 2, 2002, I was in Tallahassee in separate meetings with John O.
Agwunobi, M.D., Secretary of Health, and Ms. Mary Pat Moore, Assistant
Deputy Secretary for Medicaid Operations, to discuss the possibility of
Urinozinc-Prostahelp, dietary supplement for the prostate to be covered by
Medicaid.
 
I presented to both of them a presentation letter along with a company
packet of Urinozinc-Prostahelp, of which I am sending you a copy under
separate cover via mail. 
 
Mr. Jerry Wells, Pharmacy Program Manager for the Medicaid Pharmacy Program,
was also present during my meeting with Ms. Moore, and has been very much
aware of this product for quite some time.  Although Mr. Wells is an active
defender of drugs, he admitted to Ms. Moore and myself that
Urinozinc-Prostahelp really works, and that he has personally used the
product.  He further admitted Medicaid coverage of Urinozinc-Prostahelp
could save Medicaid a lot of money.
 
I actually think, based on my experience of ten years in the Miami area that
the Medicaid coverage of Urinozinc-Prostahelp could save Medicaid 30% to 40%
of total monies spent on prostate drugs.  Please see the price comparison
chart below:
Price Comparison
Drugs v. Dietary Supplement
Price per year Medicaid cost
Proscar
$1040.76
Hytrin 1 mg
$716.76
Hytrin 2 mg
$752.76
Hytrin 5 mg
$806.76
Cardura 1 mg, 2 mg, 3mg
$500.76
Cardura 5 mg
$518.76
Urinozinc-Prostahelp, dietary supplement for the prostate
$250.00
 
Mr. Wells raised the issue of the difficulties involved for the processing
of payment for non-drug products. The whole situation regarding this product
is now open and we are trying to find a solution that as a result will save
Florida Medicaid millions of dollars and serving the purpose of helping
seniors maintain a healthy prostate. 
 
Jeb, I sincerely hope a pilot program can be initiated in the Dade county
area for one or two years in order to properly evaluate its results.
 
Another, issue raised during this meeting was that perhaps companies of
other dietary supplements will argue that they also deserve the same
treatment.  However, as I pointed out to them, Urinozinc-Prostahelp is the
only dietary supplement for the prostate with a U.S. Patent, and the only
one submitted to two clinical studies with excellent results as mentioned in
their letter (see attachment).  Finally, you can be sure this is a win win
situation for the state of Florida.
 
Sincerely yours,
 
 
Carlos Perez

The school code says:  if the staff and SAC cannot agree, all money shall be

Remember, however, that the law does not take effect until 1/7/03, so this

Schools have given their money to other schools in the past.  If the staff

14 churches collected diapers and baby misc items for us on May 5.  They
have until May 10 to finish their collections.  Some wanted to do the
entire month of May.  Many designated diaper drive coordinators at the
churches noted on their form that their place of business would also
collect.  All had a choice of delivering to us or being contacted for a
pick-up after May 10.  One church has delivered their donations already.
We have an ample supply of stuffed baby/toddler diaper bags and loose baby
items on hand (Jr League and Prudential Financial Services).  Catholic
Charities provides baby formula/baby food bags on-going.  Turn around time
from CC is less than one hour, if we run out of formula/food.

FANG has committed to doing a diaper drive in conjunction with Operation
Christmas Stocking in December. I also talked with TV12 about doing a
diaper drive in their viewing area but have not heard back yet (see below
e-mail sent to TV 12).

. . I enjoyed talking with you on the phone last week.  It is exciting to
know that Channel 12 may work with us on a Diaper Drive for children in
foster care.  Here is some information regarding a future diaper drive:
More than 1,300 abandoned, neglected or abused children are currently in
foster care in Baker, Clay, Duval, Nassau and St. Johns Counties.  45%
or more of children in foster care are in diapers.  When they come in to
care, they usually have just the clothes they are wearing, and no personal
belongings, much less diapers.  The average newborn to one year old uses
8-10 diapers a day.  Older children who have been severely neglected or
that have special medical needs and wear diapers are especially in need
of diapers. Older children may use 4 - 6 diapers a day. At an average of
six diapers
per child, 365 days a year, that equals 2,190 diapers per child, or
1,281,150 diapers
a year for 585 children.

Imagine what a diaper drive would do to help all these children.  There are
so many
fun ways that we could kick off this project. Perhaps Channel 12
personalities (the dads or dads to be) could have a diaper changing contest
on the air to see who was the fastest change artist.   This project would
blend well with Mother's Day, Father's Day, or on its own.
I hope that you will consider this worthwhile endeavor.  Please feel
free to contact me at 723-2143 or via e-mail to respond.  I look forward to
meeting with you to answer any questions you might have.  Thank you.

We also have two Jax Wal-Marts that call me to pick up packages year round,
and also two Target sources, one here in Jax and one in Orange Park.

I know you didn't ask, but the 2002 Back to School Party is 7/23 at
SkateWorld.  FP&L will again sponsor the party so every child in foster
care can skate free and Prudential again has committed to being the other
major sponsor.  We are meeting in two weeks to plan the party.

I read a great book on growing companies that warned the problem with most companies is they put their best people in solving problems instead of creating new revenue.

RED MARBLES  


During the waning years of the depression in a small south eastern Idaho  
community, I used to stop by Brother Miller's roadside stand for  
farm-fresh produce as the season made it available.  Food and money were still  
extremely scarce and bartering was used, extensively.  


One particular day Brother Miller was bagging some early potatoes for  
me. I noticed a small boy, delicate of bone and feature, ragged but clean,  
hungrily apprising a basket of freshly picked green peas.  


I paid for my potatoes but was also drawn to the display of fresh green peas.  
I am a pushover for creamed peas and new potatoes.  Pondering the peas,  
I couldn't help overhearing the conversation between Brother Miller and  
the ragged boy next to me.  


"Hello Barry, how are you today?"  

"H'lo, Mr.  Miller.  Fine, thank ya.  Jus' admirin' them peas......  sure look good."  

"They are good, Barry.  How's your Ma?"  

"Fine.  Gittin' stronger alla' time."  

"Good.  Anything I can help you with?"  

"No, Sir.  Jus' admirin' them peas."  

"Would you like to take some home?"  

"No, Sir.  Got nuthin' to pay for 'em with."  

"Well, what have you to trade me for some of those peas?"  

"All I got's my prize marble here."  

"Is that right?  Let me see it."  

"Here 'tis.  She's a dandy."  

"I can see that.  Hmmmm, only thing is this one is blue and I sort of go  
for red. Do you have a red one like this at home?"  

"Not 'zackley .....but, almost."  

"Tell you what.  Take this sack of peas home with you and next trip this  
way let me look at that red marble."  

"Sure will.  Thanks, Mr.  Miller."  


Mrs.  Miller, who had been standing nearby, came over to help me.  
With a smile she said: "There are two other boys like him in our  
community, all three are in very poor circumstances.  


Jim just loves to bargain with them for peas, apples, tomatoes or  
whatever. When they come back with their red marbles, and they always do, he  
decides he doesn't like red after all and he sends them home with a bag of  
produce for a green marble or an orange one, perhaps."  


I left the stand, smiling to myself, impressed with this man.  A short  
time later I moved to Utah but I never forgot the story of this man, the boys 
and their bartering.  


Several years went by each more rapid than the previous one.  Just  
recently I had occasion to visit some old friends in that Idaho community and 
while I was there learned that Brother Miller had died.  
They were having his viewing that evening and knowing my friends wanted  
to go, I agreed to accompany them.  


Upon our arrival at the mortuary we fell into line to meet the relatives  
of the deceased and to offer whatever words of comfort we could. Ahead of  
us in line were three young men.  


One was in an army uniform and the other two wore nice haircuts, dark  
suits and white shirts...very professional looking.  
They approached Mrs.  Miller, standing smiling and composed, by her  
husband's casket.  Each of the young men hugged her, kissed her on the  
cheek, spoke briefly with her and moved on to the casket.  


Her misty light blue eyes followed them as, one by one, each young man  
stopped briefly and placed his own warm hand over the cold pale hand in  
the casket.  


Each left the mortuary, awkwardly, wiping his eyes.  


Our turn came to meet Mrs. Miller.  I told her who I was and mentioned  
the story she had told me about the marbles.  Eyes glistening she took my  
hand and led me to the casket.  "Those three young men, that just left, were  
the boys I told you about.  They just told me how they appreciated the  
things Jim "traded" them.  


Now, at last, when Jim could not change his mind about color or  
size...they came to pay their debt.  We've never had a great deal of the wealth of  
this world," she confided, "but, right now, Jim would consider himself the  
richest man in Idaho."  


With loving gentleness she lifted the lifeless fingers of her deceased  
husband. Resting underneath were three, magnificently shiny, red  marbles.  


Moral: We will not be remembered by our words, but by our kind deeds.

Importance:	High

For your meeting w/ Citigroup today, we are working w/ JAX community and EFI
on keeping Citigroup in JAX.   Below, you will find text from a letter I
sent to Jim King (Copied to George Seegers and Mayor Delaney) April 17.  We
stand ready to provide incentives to assist.  However, in order for us to
provide QTI for job expansions, the locals will have to put up a match.  So
far, the Mayor doesn't support providing incentives to encourage businesses
to grow on the South versus the North side of town.

CONFIDENTIALLY:  We are looking at using the remainder of the Closing Fund
($700K) as an incentive to keep Citigroup in Jacksonville.  This has not yet
been decided but it may be something for you to throw on the table if
discussions turn that direction.


-----------------------


The Honorable Jim King Jr.
State Senator
9485 Regency Square Blvd, Suite 108
Jacksonville, FL  32225

Dear Senator King:

On behalf of Governor Bush, thank you for your letter regarding Citigroup
and its Jacksonville operations.  George Seegers placed a call to the
Governor's Office and spoke with Kathleen Shanahan earlier this week to
discuss the company's long term plans as they relate to Jacksonville.
Kathleen immediately contacted my office to ensure we were aptly engaged.

While details are confidential per the company's request, Enterprise Florida
has been working with the company's consultant, as well as local economic
development leaders since February on Citigroup's growth and success in
Jacksonville.  Without all the facts before me, I can say that if Citigroup
were to expand its presence in Jacksonville, there are significant
incentives that the state could offer them--of course, if requested and
supported by the City of Jacksonville.  Such incentives include the
Qualified Targeted Industry (QTI) Tax Credit, Quick Response Training,
Incumbant Worker Training, Capital Investment Tax Credit, and the Closing
Fund. 
 
Please know, we greatly value the presence of Citigroup throughout our state
and stand ready to support their retention and continued expansion in any
way we are able.  Importantly, we will need to work closely and
cooperatively with Jacksonville leadership on this and therefore appreciate
your attention to this matter.  I would recommend that you place a call to
Mayor Delaney to affirm your support of the company in Jacksonville and your
readiness to assist in building its presence.  At that time, the Mayor can
outline those matters of concern to the City, if any.  I will ask the
Governor to consider doing the same.

Please do not hesitate to contact me directly if ever I can provide
assistance.  I can be reached on (850) 487-2568.

Sincerely,


Pamella J. Dana

Office of Tourism, Trade, and Economic Development

Subject:	Transporation Disadvantaged Funding - Please increase

** Low Priority **

Dear Senators:

Please support the House Offer presented this morning for Budget Line Item 2102 to increase the Transportation Disadvantaged Trust Fund. It has not been increased in eight years and we need trips to the doctor, work and other activities of daily living in our community, especially here on the Treasure Coast.

Thank you for your past, and continued, support of transportation disadvantaged funding.

Best,

Governor Bush, 
I respectfully request your consideration of Mike Whitehead to fill one of the vacancies on the Escambia County Commission.  As a former Escambia County Commissioner, Mike brings the experience and knowledge the community needs during this difficult transition.  I understand that if he is appointed he will not seek re-election to the Board.  During his tenure on the commission, Mike was an active member of the Florida Association of Counties.  He also successfully completed the Florida Counties Foundation Certification Program.  This is a voluntary continuing education program, which includes training on a range of topics such as county government roles and responsibilities, financial management, and ethics.  As you know, these appointments must reassure the citizens of Escambia County and the county government staff that there will be stability and strong leadership in its local government.  Mike will bring the needed leadership and confidence to move Escambia County forward.  Call me if you have any questions or need additional information.  Thank you.

Subject: graduation rates


Dear Governor,
        Thank you for your support of the school code bill as it would not have passed without your help.
        During the press conference you expressed some frustration at how long college students take to graduate and most of us in higher education agree.  We are taking steps to reduce the time to graduation but I did want to point out that we are doing a better job than it appears and part of the problem is how we define and report graduation rates.
        The term "time to graduation" is made up of many interrelated factors.  In the simplest case we could report a 70% 6 year rate but this is a 65% 4 year rate with another 5% of the students taking more time.   Also, the graduation rate in Florida is complicated as a result of our excellent job of articulation among institutions so that many students start at one institution and graduate at another yet these students are not counted at either institution.
        The chart below shows that at FSU (and most institutions in FL) most students do graduate in 4 years with an average of all students at 4.3 yrs.  How we report data affects our perception.  That said we are working hard to have all students graduate in 4 yrs or less.
        Thanks again for your support, Larry Abele

We never saw any effort on your part to try to "find common ground."  We couldn't get a 15 minute appointment to tell our side.  Your reliance on Ms. Castille in this issue is as obvious as her bias toward Save the Manatee Club (and Pat Rose) and away from your Republican base.  You are not well served by an aide that will not listen to our side and promises things she has no intent to deliver (she has promised justification for the draconian new speed zones in Brevard--we know there is no real justification, only emotional).  
 
You have been misled by environmentalists who tell you that "these rules only add 15 minutes to a boating trip.".  The new rules in Brevard, which you promised would not happen (see attached image) eliminate almost all the good watersports areas and make boating a thing of the past for hundreds of waterfront homeowners in Brevard.  Now what are we going to do?

Sorry to be so tardy in my response. 

I think that the article is an accurate depiction of the situation with some
students who are not proficient/literate readers - for whatever reason
(e.g., dyslexia, provided a reader in lieu of effective reading instruction,
etc.).  The issue will still boil down to whether a standard diploma means
reading comprehension in Florida or not.  

Also highlighted here is that we (K-12) are perceived as keeping students
from getting access to colleges (who will assign students a full-time reader
as an accommodation) because they can't pass the HSCT or FCAT.  Remembering
that many states do not have standards for receipt of a high school diploma
(e.g., in Texas students with disabilities who complete their IEP goals get
the same diploma as students who take the TASS and high school courses) - I
believe NCLB will change that for all!

The School Code Rewrite does include the language about the disconnect
between classroom instructional and test accommodations.

Let me know if you need more!

Manny Mencia aked that we keep you posted on our meetings with U.S. Customs
regarding the implementation of the recently-issued Modified
International-to-International Transit Program.  I am pleased to report that
we met yesterday with Customs and the major international airlines operating
ITI flights at MIA and have agreed on the procedures for processing ITI
passengers and baggage.  The goal is to implement the modified procedures on
May 15 - the start of the peak summer travel season - provided we can make
certain minor facility modifications.   All the major issues with Customs
have been resolved, and they have been very cooperative.

Unfortunately, INS has not been as cooperative.  They did not attend the
scheduled meeting yesterday morning, however, we have a tentative meeting
scheduled for this afternoon.  At this point, we do not know how INS will
interpret the Modified ITI procedures issued jointly by the Justice
Department and the Treasury Department.  Because the inspection procedures
for ITI passengers are under INS' control, we cannot implement the modified
procedures without their cooperation and approval.  Our efforts to establish
a dialogue continue.

As you know, the issuance of the Modified ITI procedures is a major victory
for Miami International Airport and its international airlines operating ITI
flights.  One airline in particular, Iberia Airlines of Spain, was seriously
considering moving their Miami international connecting hub to another
country.  The modified ITI procedures were joyously welcomed by Iberia,
American Airlines, United Airlines, and others.  Hopefully, we will be able
to make progress with INS so that the Modified ITI procedures can be
implemented by May 15.

I hope you know how much we appreciate the Governor's support and active
participation on this issue.  Without his personal involvement, these
modified procedures would not have been possible.  Once again, you have our
deepest gratitude.

Please feel free to call me at (305) 876-7533 if you have any questions.  We
will continue to keep you posted.  Thank you.

 Wall Street Journal
 REVIEW & OUTLOOK
 Chokehold on Charters

Imagine a businessman who sees an opportunity to build a Burger King in
a
town that has never known anything but McDonald's. Then imagine that the

town's response is that he needs the permission of McDonald's
management.

That's precisely the model all too many states have imposed on charter
schools, one of the few innovations to come out of the public school
system.
And it looks as though it is about to get worse before it gets better,
as
the enemies of school choice agitate for "reforms" intended to claw back

political control.

New York state alone has almost two dozen restrictive bills now working
their way through the legislature. The one introduced by Assemblyman
Paul
Tonko, a Schenectady Democrat, would halt the opening of a dozen
charters
that have already been approved. As he puts it, "Charter schools drain
precious resources from public schools."

News flash: Charters are public schools.

But with one crucial difference. Charter schools were designed to work
outside the system, by giving parents more accountability and choice and

giving teachers and administrators more independence from the
bureaucracies
and unions. Clearly there is a huge public appetite for charters. From a

single charter school in St. Paul, Minnesota, serving just 20 students
10
years ago, America today has 2,357 charters serving 579,880 children.

The growing popularity of charters is precisely what is provoking the
education empire to strike back. As the Center for Education Reform
points
out, mostly this is a question of authority: In about half the 37 states

that allow charters, they remain hostage to state education departments
or
local school boards. That means that the people who decide whether a
charter
can open are often the same people who see charters as a threat to their

power.

Take the Vista Literacy Academy Charter School in California, which won
its
charter in the teeth of resistance from the local establishment. When
more
than 100 charter supporters turned out to persuade a reluctant Vista
school
board to approve their charter last year, the board moved their final
vote
to an 8 a.m. meeting -- when most parents would presumably be on their
way
to work. Undeterred, the parents threatened to mount a recall effort
against
any board member who voted "No." That seemed to persuade them; the board

voted 5-0 in favor.

But now the push has moved well beyond slowing down new charters. In
Michigan, political stalemate has given charters a reprieve from a bill
that
would have introduced more oversight from the state's Department of
Education -- but the political price was leaving intact a state cap on
the
number of charters. In Minnesota, the teachers unions say their aim is
to
force charters to "operate under the direction of locally elected
officials
with union representation." In Florida, the head of the School Board
Association wants to eliminate a charter applicant's ability to appeal a

denial from the local school board.

It speaks volumes about the charter movement that while it is parents
who
lead the effort to establish charters, the anti-charter agenda is pushed
by
school boards and teachers unions and the politicians who flack for
them.
And though these vested interests talk about standards and reform, what
they
really want is the control that would make charters indistinguishable
from
the one-size-fits-all approach of the education status quo. As one
anti-charter Tennessee legislator recently put it, "Says who we need
options?"

We don't pretend that charters are the answer to the education crisis
that
is leaving so many American children behind. But charters are one
answer,
and they do have the virtue of making money follow the child. The
hostility
that generates should remind us that to the education blob the enemy
isn't
merely vouchers. It's anything that takes money and power outside their
hands -- even if it's another public school.

Hi,

Do you remember me? I'm the one who fought long and hard to get my elderly 
invalid stepmother, Naoma Hollis Innanen, back from the clutches of a young 
caregiver who took her away from all the family she had left.  Well, she 
died a year ago this last December. The caregiver got everything and we 
didn't even get her ashes so we could scatter them with our late father. 
Even if we had got the ashes  it wouldn't have helped as the caregiver took 
the house away and sold it off as well.  I got no help from the Volusia 
County DCF people, the sheriff or even the Titusville people when she was 
spirited off there.

I tried to tell you back then what problems I saw in the department. You 
didn't listen to me then. You even attempted to fire the one really 
wonderful case worker who tried to help us. You didn't listen to her 
either. Now I see in the news that you have a missing little girl who's 
grandmother was blown off in a similar way to me.

Are you ready to listen now? I'm still here and I still am willing to help 
you but first you have to listen.

Subject:	from disabled students at Woodhouse

We are 16 disabled adults living at Woodhouse Group Home in Dania Beach, FL.  
We are writing in an attempt to discourage you from voting for a reduction in 
funding for Adults with Disabilities education in order to fund Vocational 
Rehab.  Our funding for all of the various programs and services that we 
receive are constantly under the threat of cuts.  Over the years, we have all 
attended and benefitted from adult education.  Billy G. has learned to add, 
subtract, and has increased his knowledge of Florida.  Ralph L. has learned 
to add values of coins and has received training and assistance in using 
Talking Books for the Blind.  At the Lighthouse for the Blind, Ralph attends 
the Broward County School's home economics class to learn how to cook and use 
the microwave.  Tony A. says he has learned to read and write.  Phillip S. 
has been learning to dial the area code when calling his relatives in Palm 
Beach.  Many of us have become proficient on the computer and use the 
internet regularly to find out about our community and to e mail friends, 
relatives and support coordinators. Due to our disabilities, it is difficult 
for others to understand our speech, so we need this.  

There is so much that we have gained over the years-
And none of this would be provided through Vocational Rehab.. 

We understand that some people benefit from V. R., but it isn't fair that we 
would lose services in order to help them.  There should be enough money for 
us all.  We already lost money two years ago when the adults with 
disabilities program went from being funded by FTE and the DOE, and went on a 
grant.  Then, this year, Governor Bush cut our grant money even more.

I feel education is very important for all of us at Woodhouse.  Do you 
realize that it is very important that we get as much education as we can 
get?  In the past, we weren't able to go to public school, and many of us 
didn't receive all of the help we should have.  It's sad to hear that you are 
thinking of not continuing with the education we have now.  I feel very str
ongly that this should not be discontinued because all of us are very 
important.  How would you feel if you were in our shoes?  Evidently you don't 
realize what I am talking about- because maybe you have never been to see an 
Adults with Disabilites education classroom.  Mr. Bush, please think about 
this before you allow them to take away our classrooms.  I am a registered 
voter like everyone else here, but I am speaking for those who can't speak 
for themselves.  Please find another way to find money besides taking it away 
from education.- Billy Gunn

Yes..... these checks can be done, either by "name checks" only or
preferably with fingerprints.  Remember, DCF did a namecheck only on
"Gerrilyn Graham" and got a negative reply since she had not used this alias
previously (it is one of many used by her).

i need to know the number of "caregivers".  Typically these  Florida
background checks are $15 each as established by Administrative Rule and
appropriated by law, but in this case, if the number isn't extremely large,
we will grandfather these in and  waive the Florida  fee to get these checks
current.   Then, DCF should establish a prospective policy immediately of
doing these checks prior to placement, for both relatives and non-relatives.


Finally we have convinced the FBI to provide federal criminal history
information for these purposes, but they will only provide if a fingerprint
card is submitted within 5 days after the "name check" is done.  The FBI
charges $24 per fingerprint check, and we do not have standing to solicit a
waiver.

 On a related note, while all DCF caseworkers are fingerprinted and checked
on original employment (as i understand it),  i would suggest that all DCF
caseworkers be checked again against both our criminal history file and
against the outstanding warrants file.  We stand ready to help make this
happen.

Subject: DCF Scandals


Dear Governor Bush:

I am an attorney with 24 years of experience. I was employed by the  
Department of Children and Families (District 14) for fifteen months
ending 
February 2002.  I am sure you are aware of the  missing child case in
Miami, 
who did not receive the supervision required by law.  You are probably
aware 
the child was placed with someone with a criminal record. 

I can assure you from personal knowledge that failure to keep track of 
children is not an isolated incident at DCF.  Nor is placing children
with 
people with criminal records. While working in Bartow, I observed in
open 
court a case in which the department admitted that a  DCF protective
services 
worker  falsely  documented visits that were not made: in that case, the
case 
worker documented visiting a custodian-even though the custodian was
dead!  
Before I left, I observed that it was becoming common place for
protective 
services not to have seen the child for several months. (Though as of
last 
week there was a CYA order from the district office for every child to
be 
seen within 1 week). What I am describing here does even address the
category 
of misplaced children-children not necessarily missing, but unlocatable 
because the department did not keep records where they placed them!

In Polk County, the failure of a protective service worker to visit a
child 
would not make a blimp on a radar map.  Turnover of protective service 
workers is so rapid, they barely become familiar with their case loads
before 
they leave. They leave because of an abusive environment maintained by
middle 
management.  Duties best assigned to other parties are often assigned to
"PS" 
workers. Imagine assigning a rookie more than 100 cases (which
translates to 
100 monthly home visits and 400 supervised visits per month) in addition
to 
extensive writing of case plans and court appearances at judicial review

hearings. It is physically impossible to do their job completely. Middle

management offers them little help and relies on blaming the judicial
system 
(including one  of your appointees) for the mess they created.  If
anything 
goes visibly wrong, management scapegoats the case worker even when the
case 
worker may be correct. 

I doubt that Kathleen Kearney is aware how bad things are in District
14.  
Management's best skill is covering their mistakes. At DCF, employees
are 
told they  by management that we would never want to communicate with 
Kathleen Kearney, who the management  portrays as an irrational,
narcissist 
tyrant whose primary concern was getting her title correct on official
agency 
letterhead. When I was in private practice, I dealt with Kathleen
Kearney and 
she is not the person management described. I surmise the last thing 
management wanted is for the Secretary to know the truth.

What is the truth? Although DCF is a group of well intentioned social
workers 
, they  think they are not bound by the law. Historically, DCF was an
agency 
of social workers who were enjoined by the Florida Supreme Court from 
practicing law without a license.  The relics of the old system became
middle 
management, which perceives the agency as a turf war between the relics
and 
the legal system that oversees them.  The agency views legislative
mandates 
and judicial determinations with contempt. You made a fine appointment
with 
Roger Alcott. However, DCF would rather rationalize its failures by
blaming 
judges rather than bringing its practices in conformity with current
law. In 
the 15 months I was there, it would have been the uncommon case that met
any 
time standard set by the legislature. 

More importantly, DCF middle managers tend to make up their own law. The

legal division has no backbone and frivolous cases are often filed .
Even 
extreme conservatives would have to admit that the constitutional rights
of 
innocent parents are being trampled.  Taxpayer money is being wasted. 

To get more directly to my next point, a missing child is a terrible
thing. 
However, a much greater scandal is brewing. To state it simply, DCF is 
participating in a legal, but highly unseemly practice. The federal 
government pays a $4,000.00 incentive for each child, over a quota,
adopted 
out.  DCF gets its "inventory" of children to adopt out by terminating 
parental rights. DCF is filing lawsuits it knows it cannot win in an
attempt 
to obtain federal money. It hopes that some parents will sign surrenders
or 
default out of frustration with the system. The lead termination
attorney in 
Lakeland even publicly admitted he would take advantage of an
unrepresented 
person.   To give you an example, in one case I defended in private
practice, 
DCF tried to terminate one mother's rights because she repeatedly had
dirty 
laundry in her house! Our courts call termination of parental right
cases  
the equivalent of death penalty cases, and DCF is filing them to
subsidize 
their operating budget. Even when DCF loses these contested cases, the
public 
loses because of the  unwarranted trauma to the families and the legal
and 
court costs to state and local government are unconscionable.

One final point, before I go. DCF has a complete lack of understanding
of 
constitutional rights, I have personally seen a case where DCF insisted
it 
receive final divorce papers from a fundamentalist Christian as a
condition 
to the return of her daughter. This is not an isolated incident in
District 
15. The state has liability for such behavior under federal law. 

In summary, I once was opposed to privatization. DCF is so intrinsically

flawed, it must be totally abolished to serve the public. Privatization
may 
or may nor work better, but it will offer more accountability.


Sincerely,


Christopher DeSantis

To whom this may concern:
 
As Account Executive of D&A Nutrition Inc. , former NFL player and graduate of Florida State University, I have had occasions to work closely with Hiram Clayton Ingram for approximately seven years.  From July 1995 through May 5, 2002.
 
It has been a true pleasure and privilege to get to know Clay on a personal and professional basis.  In my lifetime I have rarely encountered an individual with the enthusiasm, spirit, and commitment that Clay exhibits.  He has continuously adapted to and embraced many new challenges and has never let me down in our business or personal relationship.  He always represents his company well internally and externally.  I consistently receive positive comments on his positive attitude and professional manner from others.  His ability to perform at any level clearly stems from his natural ability that is truly genuine and sincere.
 
I can highly recommend Clay for any position that would utilize his broad set of skills including sales, customer service, and project management.  He will have an immediate and positive impact on any organization that is fortunate enough to have him join their team.
 
For further discussion I am available to expand on my comments on Hiram at 850-251-6473 from 8am to 8pm Eastern Time.

Dear Child Advocate: 

This afternoon (Monday, May 6th), Governor Jeb Bush appointed a four-member Blue Ribbon Panel on Child Protection to review the performance of the child protection system in Miami-Dade County.  The panel members are: David Lawrence, President of the Early Childhood Initiatives Foundation (who will chair the panel); Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, President of Barry University; Sara Herald, currently Chief Administrative Officer of Union Planters Bank and formerly Regional Vice-President of the Children's Home Society of Florida; and Carol Licko, a partner with Hogan and Hartson law firm, and former General Counsel for the Governor. 

The Panel is on a stringent time frame.  The Governor has asked for an interim report by May 20th, and a final report by June 3rd. We applaud the Governor for taking this assertive step and welcome the direct involvement of four such distinguished Floridians.  Given the intensity of nationwide interest in the plight of Rilya Wilson, and the depth of coverage of the series of missteps which have been documented in this case, it is essential that the community of Florida understand more about the intricacies of our child protection system.  

Advocates are eager to assist in this process, and are encouraged to communicate with the Governor and his staff regarding perceptions about the needs for system improvement, and opportunities for policy and program reform.  More information about the Blue Ribbon Panel (including the panel's mission/charge and members biographies) are available at www.myflorida.com.

READINESS PROVISO LANGUAGE UPDATE 

We reported Friday, May 3rd regarding proviso language being proposed in the budget which would target readiness funds for "four-year-olds", perhaps at the expense of services for children of other ages......We received unofficial word on Monday morning that the proposed language is "off the table" - meaning it is no longer being considered.  We do not have that on authority, however, so we're continued our advocacy on this matter of importance.....

WELCOME YOUR FEEDBACK AND VALUE YOUR SUPPORT.

Ms. Avery,  I finally got a "nibble" on some potential funding for this
project.  David Roach, Executive Director of the Florida Inland Navigation
District, said he has some grant money the county could apply for if there
were some other funding partners.  I talked with Richard Bonner at the Corps
of Engineers and he will check to see if they might have some leftover
end-of-the-year money they could tap.  Nothing definite yet but wanted to
keep you posted.  I will let you know what I hear back.

Karen Estock of the Army Corp of Engineers in Clewiston has stated that
their funds have been cut in half. She has no money to clear the Okeechobee
Waterway. She has much less money to repair locks in dire need of
maintenance. Her funds come from a formula that relates to % of commercial
usage on the waterway, however, only 10% is commercial, 90% is recreational.
Shouldn't someone redo that formula so that funds are available to dredge
the sand bar that is in front of Port Myaka and in a couple of months boats
may not be able to pass. Stopping desperately needed traffic crossing the
state from ocean to gulf. The counties around the lake depend on its well
being from all angles, commercial, recreational, agricultural, environmental

Governor,

About ten days ago, the Appointments office sent out a memo requesting
additional candidates for the North Broward Hospital District.  Jim Blosser
figured my mom's background might make her an interesting candidate and
asked me to speak to my mother about applying.  After some research, she
decided it would be something she would be interested in applying for.  I
know you are familiar with her real estate development background, but she
also has served on a conciliatory & arbitration board, a national
scholarship panel as Florida's representative, chaired a social welfare
committee in Florida and been a religious education teacher.  I think this
involvement illustrates her commitment to addressing the needs of people in
our community.  Of course, since she's my mom...I only have great things to
say!  I just wanted to give you a heads up that she applied.  Thanks for
considering her and I understand that these are not easy decisions.

It will be nice to have session behind us.

Subject:	Re: What is your suggestion?

Governor,
 
I will try to be brief.  But since this is not my area of expertise, I may be a trifle long...please bear with me.
 
I have briefly scanned through SB 46-I Health Care bill, mainly the "clean claim" section, the pilot health flex plan and the single insured provision.  
 
Since I view the primary reason for higher medical premiums almost exclusively on uncontrolled medical costs, forcing carriers to pay medical providers before a clean claim will simply allow the medical industry to gouge the consumer even more.  The clean claim proviso will make it even harder for carriers to hold down medical costs, or even develop an incentive to do so.
 
Governor, I am a court reporter. All I do all day long is take EUOs (examination under oaths) and IMEs (independent medical examination) testimony. Under our present structure there is no incentive for medical providers to cut costs. And as long as the insurance industry can simply go to the state and raise premiums to meet rising costs, they will not play their natural and vital role in reducing costs -- that leaves the consumer virtually powerless and defenseless. We should be passing laws that strengthen the insurance carrier's hands in making sure these medical costs are reasonable, necessary and affordable.  The mere fact that insurance carriers are not asking the Legislature for more tools to address rising medical costs tells me the direction of this bill is headed in the wrong direction.
 
The health flex pilot plan is designed to help provide medical coverage for the uninsured whose family gross income equals to or less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level..about $30,000 per year. I make around $60,000 a year, gross. I pay about $800 per month in medical coverage for my wife, daughter and myself. This amount is due to go up to $890 next year. I will not be able to afford 150 percent increase on this amount. I also will not qualify for your health flex plan at present, neither will a lot of other one-life groups. There is at present no safety net for us. The health flex plan must be far more developed to insure that no one is singled out to carry an unfair burden or be left behind.
 
That leave me with the single insured issue. I have nothing against joining a larger consumer group if the transition is seamless and harmless. I see nothing in this bill that assures me that bringing one-lifers into a larger consumer pool will be a simple matter of paperwork. I have paid into my present medical coverage for the past 15 years with very little medical expense. At my age, I am not a very good prospect to a new insurance carrier and an inticing target to jettison by my insurance carrier if given half a chance. The law must ensure the pooling of one-life groups is carried out in a transparent and professional manner.
 
Yes, Governor, there are good provisions in this bill, and insurance reform is needed. But this bill is premature in its design and puts people at risk needlessly. 
 
I know you will do your best to do what is right, as you have done before. But no irreversible harm will come from putting this reform bill off another year so adequate provisions can be made to protect all the people.

Governor,
I am glad you are concerned about the uninsured in this state, as the Miami Herald states. Because if this Heathcare Bill is allowed to stand...I will be one of the uninsured, as well as thousands of other presently insured, hard working, taxpaying, self-employed citizens. 
 
If the issue is covering small business' medical needs -- that's an industry problem. If small businesses are being formed by sick people just to get small-business rates, why has the industry so aggressively sought our business, and still seek our  business? The insurance industry has enough remedies under current law to deal with this issue without putting the gun in our elected officials' hand and asking them to pull the trigger.

 
I can't see how throwing thousands of otherwise insured people out on the street will reduce the number of uninsured in this state.
I will be the first one to tell you Governor, this state needs insurance reform, it needs its uninsured covered, but like any doctor oath's, lets make sure we first do no harm in our solution to these problems.
 
 
Governor, if you allow this bill to stand, please advise me on your justifications....I will need to weight them closely for my own peace of mind if for nothing else.

I was appaulled and and saddened to hear the comments of Kathleen Kearney
regarding more than 300 "missing children".  With the attitude of the head of 
the agency being so nonchalant, I now see how the entire organization could 
function
so irresponsibly and without regard of safety.  This entire situation is an 
outrage.
I was in the process of writing a letter for all legislators in the state (my 
first ever)
when I saw tonight's news broadcast.  Ms. Kearney should be immediately 
removed from her position with DCF.  She should be a leader and example- from 
her comments tonight, it appears that these employees have followed her 
example.
What an uncaring attitude portrayed.   Cynthia Crews

Thank you, Governor.  I know everyone on the panel, and I know we'll do our very best.  I continue to be very troubled by the fact that all the dcf safeguards, all the studies, all the experts -- even all the money -- can't substitute for the two loving parents this child should have had.

Subject: GOVERNOR, YOU JUST WILL NOT BELIEVE TODAY'S COURT HAPPENINGS!


Dear Governor Jeb,
 
     Jeb, Sir, I PROMISE NOT to write to you about EVERY LITTLE ISSUE that arises in this unending cycle of trouble, but I would like to share with you about how today's court session went--it had some very rough moments for me--from a surprising source--a Children and Families Attorney...read on: 
 
We were to be in Judge Roger Alcott's courtroom at 1:30 P.M. for Amanda's hearing.  When I walked in my daughter, Ginger, was already seated in a crowd and she hatefully said, getting louder and louder, "Just what are YOU doing here? You don't belong here! Judge Strickland has put you out of the loop! You are no longer to have anything to do with my children. Judge Strickland is going to THROW YOU OUT OF HIS COURTROOM... YOU ARE NOT supposed to be here! Judge Strickland is going to charge you with CONTEMPT OF COURT!" I just ignored her and sat down in an empty seat. Ginger made a few more quiet remarks then settled down.
 
After Judge Alcott handled the next case, with about 50 people in the room, he startled me when he said loudly, "Ms. Bryan, Ms. Bryan--WHAT are you doing here?" I didn't know that he was aware that I was even in the room.
 
I answered and said, "This is where the caseworker told me to be." 
 
He then asked my daughter and I to come forward so he could see why we were in his courtroom. Ginger answered saying that we were there to have a "Pick-up Order" hearing from Amanda's last run-away that had to be signed. Alcott said, "Well, I'm not going to do it. We'll call up stairs and see when Judge Strickland is available to hear it." So we were told to go upstairs.
 
As I moved outside into the hall, Ginger was ahead of me and she turned around towards me started getting very loud saying, "Have you received your papers yet? Melisa, Jon, Josh, Amanda and I ARE SUING YOU FOR YOUR HOUSE because of all your interference in our lives throughout the years! Why, you even managed to get me kicked out of college!" Having heard threats like this from Ginger before, I just tried to ignore her.
 
To get away from the scene, I just turned on my heel and went right back into the courtroom and waited for the caseworker, Mr. Charles Brantley, and the C & F attorney, Mr. Bob Hancock, to come out. There was another gentleman with them only identified as an "observer". Then I followed them out and lagged behind so Ginger couldn't say anything else to me. I trailed them up to the 7th floor to Judge Strickland's area. 
 
At this point I was worried because it was NOT possible to find an attorney this morning who would go with me to court on such short notice and make financial arrangements with me--so once again, I was alone. But, I had to find out where they have placed Amanda, so I went on up to Judge Strickland's courtroom anyway--dreading the embarrassment of being found in Contempt just because I want to know what happens with my grandchild that I raised for years.
 
After we five sat down in the foyer, the C & F attorney, Mr. Bob Hancock, told Mr. Brantley that he wanted to talk so they went into a witness room to confer. Then Ginger really lambasted me. I tried to ignore her, but she kept on. Then I told her to just look out and enjoy the view of the area from that high. When she began again, I turned to her and said, "You know Ginger, I wish I could go back and spend more time with you when you were young. I'd go over the story of Solomon, the one where he held the baby up with the sword and the two women were there."
 
Now, I know that she knows that scripture story, but it seemed to just go over her head and surprisingly she made no comment. She started fussing at me again so then I just got my purse and went down the hall to the next seating area.
 
In about 10 minutes, the men came out of their conference. Mr. Hancock, a Children and Families attorney, whom I had never spoken to before, walked over to me and said, "Mrs. Martin?"  I said, "No sir, I'm her mother, Ms. Bryan."
 
He introduced himself and sat down. The first thing he said was, "Now I've reviewed this file, and I have seen enough here and I think we ALL know where these two kids should be."
 
I'm thinking, now I surely hope he's means with me, but all he's really said is just so much double-talk and he probably had or will use those same lines on Ginger when he talks to her about me. Thus, the Department is safe, with NO commitment to anyone--whose who are really helping the children or those who are hurting them.
 
I said, "Sir, just what do you mean by that? Would you clarify that for me?" He drew back surprised and got flustered. 
 
Seeing he didn't know where I was coming from I said, "If you are saying that you can see from the records that my daughter is really sick mentally and these kids have been damaged during these years they were sent back with her and that they don't need to be with her now--I totally agree!"
 
He went on to share that although he had NOT gotten the children's evaluations back from the testors yet, the preliminary information shows that BOTH OF THE TWO KIDS ARE REALLY MESSED UP!" 
 
I answered saying, "Yes Sir, I'm totally aware of that! I was their Foster mother for years, and BECAUSE OF THAT I can help rebuild these kids BETTER than anyone else--IF you'll work with me! I have eleven years of dealing with the Department because of my daughter's ill treatment of my grandchildren. I have much time invested in them, a big mortgage and lots of love as well as many heart aches!"
 
After that, everything went South--in a hurry! Mr. Hancock fished out a 1997 document from his file that I, myself, had just provided to Mr. Brantley when we copied most of my reams of documents a couple of weeks ago to REPLACE ALL THE FILES THAT THEY DESTROYED AS THE KIDS WERE SENT BACK TO GINGER.
 
Mr. Brantley walked over then and said, "Ms. Bryan's own notes are in the margin of that sheet in her handwriting."
 
Then Mr. Hancock said, "As you can see from this document, the judge in 1997 wrote here that you were alienating the children from their mother."
 
I answered, "Sir, the judge only had the information gathered by your department's caseworker, who was later found to have benefited from getting the kids send back to mom by getting a brand-new Ford van..."
 
Before I could finished he got very angry, raised his voice and said, "I don't care about all of that! We are NOT going to go back and re-litigate what was done then!! ALL I'M INTERESTED IN IS TWO VERY MESSED UP TEENAGERS!" 
 
"But Sir," I said, "I KNOW what I'm talking about Governor Jeb Bush had an internal investigator look into this and.." 
 
Before I could finish my statement, Mr. Hancock interupted me while he was striking Ginger's C & F file hard with his hand, "JEB BUSH!  I DON'T CARE ABOUT JEB BUSH!  WHERE IS HE??  HE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS!! We're got two messed-up teenagers to deal with here!"
 
I interrupted him saying, "Yes, Sir...and that's exactly WHY I'm here--and going through all of this again! But, Sir, (I couldn't remember his name), since Mr. Brantley has told me repeatedly that all the documented abuse to the kids that we have on Ginger in the 1997 paperwork can't be USED AGAINST her NOW, HOW CAN YOU POSSIBILY USE A 1997 PAPER AGAINST ME, SO I CAN'T HAVE THE CHILDREN'S PLACEMENT IN MY HOME AFTER HAVING THEM FOR SIX YEARS??"   
 
Mr. Hancock really lost it then with me then saying, "We are just NOT going to deal with that old stuff!"
 
I said, "Then Sir, in the name of FAIRNESS, again, HOW can you use what a bad worker wrote then a judge put in a report about me, but NOT use all the evidence on my daughter abusing the children?"

He angrily got up and said, "I DON'T CARE ABOUT FAIRNESS, LADY!!  I KNOW what's in this file and IF you don't like this Department's views" then he began walking away..."GET YOU AN ATTORNEY AND GO TO COURT!"
 
I said loud enough for him to hear me as he walked away, "Sir, you said how messed up these two kids are, well, THEY WERE NOT LIKE THEY ARE NOW--when your Department sent them back to their mom. They were doing well in school and functioning in the community--in 4-H and all Church functions--not dysfunctioned like they are now... 
 
THAT'S WHY THIS DEPARTMENT OWES THESE CHILDREN THE BEST HELP THERE IS TO HELP THEM COME OUT OF SOME OF THIS DAMAGE--IF THEY CAN!!" 
 
By the time I finished by statements, he was back over where Ginger was and totally ignoring me...
 
After the emotional hurt Ginger had put me through and now this, I couldn't help it--I began to quietly cry. I tried to quit--knowing we would go into the courtroom soon so I went into the ladies' room to pull myself together. I couldn't understand how that conversation had gotten so bad--C & F and I MUST work together IF these kids ever have a chance for a life!!!
 
When I came out of the restroom, I was surprised to the see young man only identified as an "Observer" just outside the door waiting politely on me, to show me which way they had gone to the courtroom.
 
I took a back seat and saw that Ginger, Mr. Brantley and Mr. Hancock were already standing before the Judge. Judge Strickland looked up at me, made eye contact and then went on about their business. I was relieved that HE ALLOWED ME TO STAY AND LISTEN EVEN IF I COULDN'T HAVE A VIABLE SAY--at least I didn't get charged with CONTEMPT OF COURT like I've heard some do when the "parent" doesn't want them to stay!
 
The judge asked where Amanda was in placement and the answer was in a private home--a Foster home. Dear God, I think she'll run again--soon!!
 
There was quite a bit of discussion on Amanda's "Lewd Sex Acts" charge. Judge Strickland made it clear to Mr. Hancock and Mr. Brantley that under 16 years of age there is no "consent" by either party--boy or girl, and he was adamant that both Amanda and the young boy were to be charged and it was to be followed up on. It was brought out that Amanda's next court date is on the 17th, they didn't say for what.
 
When the session was over, I asked Mr. Hancock if he would please come back and talk to me.  He answered, "Why certainly."
 
I said (still not remembering his name), "Sir, you upset me earlier as we talked because my only purpose here is to HELP my grandkids!"
 
He then went into his routine again about how well versed he was on this file, (which was, by the way, only about an inch thick) mentally, I compared it to my plastic storage tub of the many 5-inch notebook chronicling years of hearings--court orders--abuse reports--etc. and thought, Mister, you don't know ANYTHING about this case!
 
I said to him, "You know, I really am a nice lady, and I would like to apologize about what happened between us before court. I just want you to know that you can't possibly know all that Ginger's put me and her children through the last nineteen years, (That being the age of Melisa, her oldest.) and I'm upset because IF WE CAN JUST TALK AND WORK TOGETHER, we can MAYBE HELP my grandchildren to RECOVER SOME from all they have been put through."
 
He was angry and started toward the courtroom doors. I hurriedly said, "Sir, Sir, I want to ask you WHEN may I have a VISIT with my grandchildren??"
 
As he shoved open the door he turned his head and looked at me hard and said very loudly as he went out into the hall, "Lady, YOU GET YOU AN ATTORNEY and get them to REQUEST A HEARING WITH A JUDGE FOR VISITATION!!
 
I thought, "Oh, dear God!! These people (the Department) are going to keep me AWAY from the kids just as Ginger as done these last five years!! That's way the kids have lost all of the ethics, manners, and character I was trying to build into them.  
 
By then Judge Strickland was gone and no one was left but the "Observer", and the lady Clerk of the Court and Mr. Brantley, who were talking.
 
I tried to get hold of my emotions as I waited for Mr. Brantley because he has been so respectful to me (even when things would get heated) I knew I could talk to him. 
 
He saw me crying and stopped walking towards the door.
 
 I said, "Charles WHAT did I do to set that man off--OR is he ALWAYS A JERK??"
 
Charles didn't answer, then as I was crying I told him, "That man just told me I HAVE TO GET AN ATTORNEY TO GET TO HAVE VISITATION--IS THAT TRUE?"
 
Mr. Brantley stopped still and really frowned and said, "Well, I think we'll have to negotiate that one with him." 
 
As I cried, both Mr. Brantley and the other gentleman saw me into the elevator and out of the courthouse.
They stopped to talk, as I walked on to my car and then it hit me why I was crying so easily...
I'd been up all night writing to Jeb, I hadn't had but an hour and one-half of sleep 
So then as I stopped crying as I came back to Lakeland,
 I began thinking:
 
Just WHAT have I accomplished today?
 
Somehow, without meaning to I messed up my relationship with the Department.
 
They STILL use all the paper documents as THEY SEE FIT.
 
   i.e. Using old, erroneous information about me "alienating the kids against Ginger"
 
        (written by a worker that got a payoff to send the kids back) against me,
 
         while C & F chooses to NOT USE ANY OF THE OLD EVIDENCE AGAINST GINGER!
 
Now, they are demanding that I MUST GET AN ATTORNEY 
 
TO BE ABLE TO VISIT MY OWN GRANDCHILDREN 
 
WHOM THEY HAVE PHYSICALLY PLACED IN MY HOME--THREE TIMES NOW, 
 
AND THEY GAVE ME "OUTSTANDING FOSTER HOME" AWARDS SIX YEARS IN A ROW...
 
Now, I'm the enemy...when in any other case AFTER TWO REMOVALS the children are PROTECTED 
 
by TERMINATING PARENTAL RIGHTS!!
 
Dear Lord, is there ANY SENSE IN ALL THIS??
 
And my final thought: I MISSED a day's work--with NO pay
 
      because I used all my sick days staying here with Jonathan
 
      for over a week last October, while he was BETWEEN DRUG REHABS...
 
Yes, Mr. Hancock, you TRULY don't know ANYTHING about this case!!

seem in our favor.

open still: teacher liability insurance, reading (I spoke to carlton and 
elton about this), TOPS, PECO, university "equity", residential group homes, 
community mental health, substance abuse, and a number smaller issues. I have 
not discussed any of the language isses with you (proviso and implememnting

Did Liz Hirst ever get a chance to show you Shelby's 10 min. iMovie on Shelby's renovated "Hip Tech Home"  I must say it is quite good for a ten year old and also clearly protrays the impact technology and enviromental access is having on her life.

There is also a few that would be bad news for Escambia County and Florida. I won't mention any names, but, I would stay clear of former county commissioners. ( they are former for a reason)
  Escambia County is very diverse from farm lands in the North end to our white sandy beaches and Navel Air Station on the South end.

Buen dia Jeb!!

I understand that you will be meeting about the DD Redesign
recommendation today.  I know that you haven't asked, but I still
intended to write to you before the meeting about my thoughts and
impressions. Unfortunately, I haven't had the opportunity to do that. 
Today, I have been up since 3:30 a.m. working on our grant project
issues.  I will like to send a few comments about the redesign.

First, as I mentioned to you before, I feel that the system is currently
in good hands. I feel comfortable with most of the recommendations made. 
Susan is knowledgeable about the issues.  She may lacks on the political
aspect that Carl had, but I think that with you as an involved leader we
can overcome that aspect.  She, and nobody else will ever be able to
satisfy everyone all the time.  Shelly, is very young, but is very smart
and sensitive. She is an extremely fast learner.  I do not know Larry
Pintacuda very much, but he has impressed me as a caring, and honest
person that wants to learn about our issues.

I have been a little disappointed with the fact that they are not
consistent with making sure that meeting ground rules are kept. This has
cause some hard feelings among some of the members. On our last meeting
again, they didn't go over the ground rules at the beginning of the
meeting. People from the public were getting involved in issues that had
been previously discussed and agreed by the redesign committee.  I
quietly mentioned it, but nothing was done.
 
As I think about your most recent issue with the 4 year old girl from
Miami, it scares me that we may encounter such situation with our
population as well.  This was not addressed during the redesign, but for
years I have brought up the issue of the Waiver Support Coordinators
(case managers) case notes.  Why can't the state mandate for every case
worker to have a visiting log were someone at the home/facility signs it?
 Instead, WSC and other case workers spend long hours writing case notes,
and as in the little girls case, they may had not even visited the home.
Therapist, home health aides, and others have a signing log, why can't
that substitute for most case notes?

I have to be at a meeting at 7:00 a.m. and must now get ready.  I wish I
had more time.

Carinos,

Berthy

Good morning...I heard you were going to be at Homestead High on Thursday...unfortunately I will be out of town...but I wanted you to be aware that Homestead High is one of the schools participating in our Youth Crime Watch program, Battle of the Belts (a statewide initiative funded by the Safety Office FDOT) This school sadly lost 2 students in a crash recently, the report indicated that "had they been wearing their seat belt", they would have survived. My YCW coordinator, Philene Hart will be at the school that day, over seeing the events of the day along with the Homestead Police Dept. Therefore, I am giving you some statistics in case you are asked or if you want to comment.. ...Carmen
INFORMATION:
Traffic crashes are the number one killer of young people. Yet studies show that taking four seconds to buckle a safety belt reduces both the fatality rate and the serious injury rate by 50 to 75 percent in motor vehicle crashes.
It is recognized that a 10% increase in safety belt use throughout Florida will save approximately 200 lives per year, reduce horrific traffic injuries by over 6,000 and save Floridians approximately $385,000,000 in related cost.
Why High School Students? 
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Association, about 54% of young people who die in vehicle crashes are not wearing seat belts.
Motor vehicle crashes were the leading cause of death for 15 to 20 year olds in the year 2000. Accounting for roughly 1/3 of all fatalities in this age group.
In the year 2000 - 3,594 drivers 15 to 20 years of age were killed in crashes, an additional 348,000 were injured.
The fatality rate for teenage drivers, based on estimated annual rates, is about 4 times as high as the rate for drivers 25 through 69 years old.
Youths age 16 to 20 have the highest traffic-related fatality rate of any age group.
Traffic accidents are the leading cause of disability and spinal cord injuries among youth.
A 16-year-old drive is 20 times more likely to have a traffic accident as the general population.
The leading cause of death among young Hispanics is failure in wearing a seat belt. It's the second leading cause of death for Afro-Americans.
The above statistics come from National Highway Traffic Safety Association & Teen Driver Safety Series
The school that achieves the highest overall increase in safety belt usage rate in the state will be presented a $500.00 cash award.

Ana, I did not have your address to directly email you so hear goes. State law is real specific regarding who is eligible to attend Kindergarten in public schools. Private schools is another matter. If you email me directly, I will try to help.

Governor Bush is actually the gentleman I have modeled my management style after in being open and inclusive with the 30,000 employees of Miami-Dade County.  For years, he has emphasized the importance of technology and email has been a 24 hour virtual open door.  I have copied him on your request and I am sure he will have someone direct you appropriately....
 
Have a great week....

I want to know if you have an e-mail address for the State of for Governor Bush.  I would like to find out about the program where a child is eligible to attend a private school in their community.  The reason is a have a set of twin girls who will turn 5 in November but cannot be admitted into Kindergarten until the 2003-2004 school year.  I
also heard that the Pre-K program in public schools is not available to everyone and it is very expensive.  
 
I would appreciate it if you can give me some information on this program or a phone number to call.
 
Thanks,

I hope your weekend was a good one....
 
As you may have heard, Governor Bush announced the appointment of Jose "Pepe" Cancio to the Miami-Dade County Board of County Commissioners for District 12.  We will meet with him today and he will be sworn in officially on Tuesday.  On be-half of our Miami-Dade County team, I want to welcome him and please join me in that greeting should you see him in the office.
 
To update you on our budget process, we are still meeting diligently to try to meet the departmental savings plans that were put in to place as a result of the unforeseen expenses and revenue losses after September 11th.  While we are facing a very difficult time, I am confident we will be able to make it through this year.  However, our next fiscal year is a significant challenge.  As we go through the departmental meetings, we are looking a various ways of saving monies and I want to thank those of you who have sent me suggestions.  We are looking at all options at this point with an emphasis on not cutting service or programs that are currently in place.  Unfortunately, some of this may be unavoidable.  We are taking a look at some administrative efficiencies that may prove to save money as well as help many of you that are in this area and over burdened.  
 
I don't want to be an alarmist but I do think it is important that we are all kept as informed as possible.  Please feel free to email me if you have any questions or thoughts on how we can improve our service and achieve cost savings...
 
Have a great week.....

>Osceola County School Superintendent Blaine Muse said he is sympathetic

> 
>Bob Meyer sent the form back, saying Joey, who turns 18 on May 14, would

> 
>"The other students are walking because they met the requirements. He 
>did not," Muse said. 
> 
>The Meyers argue that an official could change their son's individual

Subject:	White Elephant Space Coast Airport

Dear Sirs
Please do not fund the TOPS program of $1.7 million for Space Coast airport.
The airport authority has miss spent millions of tax payers dollars in the past few years on the airport and it will never be returned.
They have spent $1 million on an empty lot or industrial complex as they like to call it.
No one has built a thing there.
the county commissioners Scarborough and Carlson have refused to listen to pilots and appoint people to the authority board that are tenants and pilots or people that have an aviation back ground.
And the FDOT continues to give grant money to the authority for signs and planning of the office building but refuses to give 80/20 funding for hangars that are sorely needed and there is a waiting list of 100 people.
Instead they keep raising hangar rents to fund this sad display of wasting our tax money.
Any comments would be greatly appreciated.
I cannot get Commissioner Scarborough to respond to  a letter I sent to him Feb 2 of this year, in regards to this wasted spending.
Thank You for your time.

Dear Committee Members,

I urge you to please support the House Offer presented on 5/6/02 for Budget
Line Item 2102 to increase the Transportation Disadvantaged Trust Fund.  It
has not been increased in 8 years and we need trips to the doctor, work and
other activities of daily living in our community.

I have a small child, four years old.  I am totally blind.  I also have four
other teenaged kids and sometimes I need to go places with them.  I need to
take my four-year-old to the doctor, preschool, etc.  In some cases, I
cannot use the ADA transportation, so I must use ADA.  I am also active in
my community, Orlando, where we have many people who cannot drive
themselves.  Please consider these people when making your decision.

We have not yet seen any update to the implementing bill since the
conference committees started meeting yesterday.  I called Rep. Johnson
Friday evening and asked that he take this out of the bill; also spoke to
House staff and asked that they be sure it gets removed.  I'll keep checking
with them.

Commissioner,

The Offense Date on this case is 11/3/01 and per the information from
Representative Farentino the incident was not reported until the first week
in December (1 month later). The evidence was not submitted to the Tampa Lab
until 1/10/02.  The items submitted were a t-shirt from the child and paper
towels from a trash can in the house.  A standard from the subject was
submitted but no samples from the child's body were received.  

On 2/8/02 the Detective called and asked for a priority on the case.  The
case was examined the detective notified on 3/22.  No semen identified on
the T-shirt and a very limited amount of semen with very few sperm was
identified on the paper towels.  DNA testing is being done and should be
completed by the end of the week.  Based on the semen found it is very
possible that all that will be identified is the subject's profile and since
he was living in the house at the time, this will have no probative value. 

Please let me know if you need anything further.  Judy had passed on the
message from Representative Farentino's Office to me.  Do you want me to
contact them and let them know that it will be completed soon?  (The case
age is now 116 days, just over our standard)

Subject:	RE: City of West Miami Wastewater Collection System Appropriation

This project did not meet the criteria established for wastewater projects this year and was vetoed last year.  Last year's criteria required that a project be approved through the water advisory panel, be funded the previous year, be under construction and serve an area that has a medium household income below the state average.  This years policy required that the projects be funded each of the last two years.  We have not told anyone what position the Governor might take on any of these projects, but have made it clear to the legislature which projects do and do not meet the criteria established.
 
The reason we have put these criteria in place regarding funding is because in the last three years the state has contributed $335 million towards the completion of these projects, and to complete the projects we have already started would cost close to $1b, so the policy was to complete those projects begun before starting new.  It is my understanding from the house that this project will be on the "final list" at $750,000.

Kathleen,

       It is our understanding that our request in the amount of $750,000.00 is not likely to be approved by Governor Bush for the July 1st budget.

       It is imperative that we ask him (through your office) to reconsider our petition to grant us the Legislative Appropriation as it is vital for the continued stability and well-being of the City of West Miami.

       West Miami is in the heart of Dade County.  33% of our population is composed of seniors who live on fixed income and simply cannot afford to pay more for a sewer system.  Our community is largely composed of Republican registered voters who support our Governor.   Our community needs his support at this time.

       I am a new mayor, just inducted two weeks ago facing critical issues.  If you feel that it would help, we would arrange to meet with Governor Bush or his designated staff, our City Manager and Independent Auditors to discuss the matter further.

       Our County Commissioner (former Mayor) Rebeca Sosa and Representative Rubio met with the Governor at the beginning of session seeking his support.

                                                                   Sincerely,

thanks for reply.  I don't know that they are involved.  Interestingly the potentially guilty party controls the budget of law enforcement.  I know the clerk of the court is looking into it, and he is good and honest.  I just thought that maybe there was some solution at state level that looked into things when the highest elected officials in the county might be the source of the problem.  SORT OF A FOX GUARDING THE HENHOUSE PROBLEM.
 
But thanks anyway.    I don't know if you or your brother have read Atlas Shrugged  (my guess is Tom Feeney has) but I would hate to see this country bring the book to life.     WE NEED TO ELIMINATE CORPORATE INCOME TAXES  so that money now going to the government could be returned to consumers either in the form of dividends, stock increases, salary/benefit increases or new jobs..

Yes, Ilene, I have been working through the landfill site for over six months.  For four months I was denied public documents until I threatened to sue over them.  In this case, the stone wall is the Administration, with the Commission blankly looking on.  $7.2 million for property under contract for $1.2 million, a $6.0 million profit for the seller who held title less than one day.

Thanks Pat for your email. The Governor has been actively engaged on this
issue as he clearly understands the importance of international visitors to
Florida.  As such, the Governor sent a letter of concern in late April to
INS Commissioner Ziglar which I am attaching below. I would appreciate it if
you could spread the word to your membership on the Governor's leadership in
this regard.

You should be aware that other states and their respective leadership have
been slow to respond to this issue.  It may behoove FIBA to reach out to
sister organizations to garner support with their elected leaders.

Subject: INS proposal to limit tourist and prof visas


Dear Pam,

Following up on my conversation with Tony Villamil, FIBA  has become
concerned about the INS proposal which would provide a "default" business or
tourist visa of 30 days.  In reading the Federal Register, it appears that
the INS has flexibility, but it is uncertain how or if it will be exercised.

FIBA brought this to the attention of Senator Nelson, who has already
written a comment letter to the INS.  The comment period was only 30 days
and ends shortly, I believe on May 12th.

FYI, today I was speaking with a private banker from First Union in Miami.
She has a  customer from Latin America who has been coming to the U.S. for
the past 50 years. He owns a condominum in the Santa Maria, which is one of
the luxury condos on Brickell Avenue in Miami.  His experience makes it
appear that the INS is already enforcing the 30 day default rule because he
was given a 30 day visa. His question to the private banker was "Why do I
want to own a condo in Florida if I can only stay 30 days?".

I have also been told that one of the large domestic banks in Florida which
is active in real estate construction is  very concerned about the impact of
this regualtion on their business.  The 30-day visas could also impact the
ability of businessmen who want to open new banks or businesses in Florida,
because they would not be able to stay long enough to get their business
completed.

It goes without saying that there could also be a negative for Florida's
tourism.

FYI, I have attached the letter from Senator Nelson, as well as a comment
letter from Nino Lucio's firm (Nino is General Counsel of FIBA).

Although this is not directly a banking issue, the impact will be felt
across the Florida economy and will affect banks as well as other
industries.

Please let me know if there is anything FIBA can do to assist you,


Thank you,

governor bush,      5-7-02
 
i hate to keep complaining, but the dbpr search engine isn't worth a shit!
u can't find any real estate or appraisers on the search engine, and they haven't fixed the new system in months, so what good is it? 
it isn't!
the old system was great, u put in the type of license that someone has, 
the county, and all of that type of licensees come up. 
now u need there full name, license number, and then if ur lucky, the name will come up. if i know all of that, i don't need a search engine!!! lets use some common sense here, about what we are talking about! and they aren't! 
the real estate and appraisal depts in the state are so screwed up, u wouldn't believe it!  
the problem is that the people running the department have no idea what is going on in the field!  thats why they can't help the people in the real world, and they are in the FREC world, or the FREAB world.
some of the stuff they do is just right down stupid! it makes no sense at all ! who thinks in the department? anyone? the people who do it everyday for a living are wondering ?
and laughing- and laughing hard!!!
i am glad to see the head of education dept. for real estate get the hell out finally. he had a choke hold on the education department, the question now is, does the replacement have any idea of what she is doing? does she know anything about what it takes to teach or run a school?  so far, i don't think so! im an instructor-real estate,residential and commercial appraiser instructor, and i have yet to recieve any e-mail or letters of any changes to state rules or regs, or any info on schools or whats going on around the state from the education dept.  
think that would be a good idea? 
it has never happened! 
do u think it will?
appraisers in this state are about to take there continuing education of 30 hours- its alway 30 hours, do we need 30 hours, has the business changed that much? NO! so why not reduce the hours? gee, i never thaught of that!!!
the whole system is screwed up, and if i had to tell u about it, u would have to laugh at the system. it needs to be straightened out by someone in the field, not the people who think they know what they are doing, because we know that they don't!  the dept. is in a sorry state of affairs. 
i still think buddy johnson would be a better hotel and entertainment director promoting visitors to come to florida, than he would be in the real estate dept. that makes no sense to me at all. of course, he is from plant city, and it is in my county, and that helps sometimes. thats politics! 
so i applied for the frec and didn't get it, ok, so what does marie powell care about the business, she sold out! she made her money years ago, why have someone on the board like that.
how about someone young? we need  some young blood in the system, i don't mean me, i mean find someone young and give him/her something to say, its 2002! lets get on the stick, and get with the program here! lets all get on the same sheet of music!  its so screwed up, it isn't even funny anymore!
u want to shut down the community association managers council, i wish u would appoint me to straighten the mess out, and i can save the state alot more than it could pay me. with over 12 years in the business, and
one of the most highly licensed people in the state, doesn't make sense to seek out someone who know whats going on , and has a macro view of the department?
this micro management has got to stop, there is no common bond between departments. no standardization of policy, terms, prices,procedures, or forms.
everyone is doing there own little thing and living in there own little world, well out of many- one!
the day is coming and hopefully soon!

DEP, CARGILL AGREE TO LONG-TERM SOLUTION TO MULBERRY PHOSPHATE'S
ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS

TALLAHASSEE - Department of Environmental Protection Deputy Secretary Allan
Bedwell today announced that DEP and Cargill Fertilizer, Inc. have reached
an
agreement that will further protect the Tampa Bay region's waterways and the
residents of the area surrounding the abandoned phosphate plant formerly
operated by the bankrupt Mulberry Corporation.  The end result of this
cooperative effort will be the permanent closing of the environmentally
dangerous phosphogypsum stack.

For the past several months, DEP has taken financial responsibility and
worked diligently to stabilize the Mulberry site and reduce the level of
acidic process water in the phosphogypsum stacks to the point where they
could withstand heavy rains. At least one spill has been averted by these
actions.  

 Pending approval of the federal bankruptcy court, Cargill will acquire the
existing plant facilities and the remainder of the site - the phosphogypsum
stack system - will remain under the control of a court appointed receiver
charged with ensuring the environmental security of the site. The DEP will
contract with Cargill to immediately initiate the closure of the
phosphogypsum stack system, the same system from which a catastrophic spill
(and subsequent massive fishkill) overflowed into the Alafia River in 1997. 

"What we have been able to accomplish up to this point has been
significant,"
said Bedwell, "but we can now, once and for all, ensure the environmental
security of this site. Last year we applied the band-aid, but now we must
perform the corrective surgery. We are pleased to work with Cargill to take
immediate action to provide long-term protection for the environment."

Since February 2001, the DEP has spent approximately $13 million to maintain
the environmental integrity of the site.  Without this new agreement, it is
estimated that Florida taxpayers would have to pay in excess of $50 million
to close the Mulberry facility. Now, thanks to DEP's successful negotiation
and pending court approval, the taxpayers will save between $20 to $25
million.

Cargill will immediately initiate the closure activities, which will take
approximately five years to complete, by mid-May. In order to protect the
environment, Cargill will use its industry-specific engineering and
operating
experience to secure the gypsum storage area and the system's water. Cargill
is expected to consume most of the 2 billion gallons of acidic process
wastewater from the site at its Bartow plant, which is adjacent to the
Mulberry Phosphate Corporation's property.

Dear Governor:
I respectfully request that you veto this bill - 

The Everglades Restoration Bill, designated as HB813

-  although I recognize the importance of it, the very limiting amendment to it  requires that it be vetoed. It is unfortunate that Senator King found it necessary to further endanger the Everglades by adding this amendment...therefore, I ask that you add my name to the list of those seeking a veto. To do otherwise would destroy the intent of the original bill.
Thank you

Hello Governor ...

I am proud of you.  I read about your heartfelt experience during a drug
summit in Tallahassee.  It was very courageous to feel it more important to
speak candidly about a recent pain.  I continue to pray for you and your
family as my family is going through our own experience with Gallen. 

The greatest part about you, Governor, is that you take your experience and
say "how can I better the world by it".  To confront drugs ... at anytime
... is difficult.  To do it now, is pure honesty, compassion and
determination. 

I said this to you in January of 95 as we were experiencing another type of
pain ... disappointment in the recent outcome of your first run for Governor
... "you make the world a better place simply by being in it".  Never lose
that quality, Gov. It wears on you very well and we all benefit from your
wisdom, your intellect, your passion and your leadership.

Be Well,
Be Blessed,
Be JEB!

Another said,

"...Did I menchin I met the govner.  I shook his hand and got a pictur with

Still one more,

"...I was glad to finally Governor, Jeb Bush.  I wanted to meet him my whole

The Legislature is in special session and the Adult Handicapped Fund is 
once again under siege.  This time it doesn't appear to be the 
legislature's fault, but rather, is at the request of the new VR 
Director, who is also in charge of this program.  TIME IS OF THE UTMOST 
IMPORTANT.  Please send the following message to the following people. 


THE MESSAGE: 


We have learned that Department of Education staff has asked that funds 
be taken from the Adult Handicapped Fund in order to address deficits in 
the VR and Blind Services Programs.   It is extremely unfair to adults 
with disabilities that one of the programs benefiting them should be 
compromised in order to benefit another.  The individuals who receive 
the benefits of the Adult Basic Education provided through the Adult 
Handicapped Fund are those who will likely never be able to be 
competitively employed, and therefore, not able to benefit from VR 
services.  In Miami-Dade, approximately 2,863 adults with disabilities 
are registered at 25+ agencies.  Each receives an average of 25-30 hours 
of educational services weekly.  While we recognize that there are many 
competing funding priorities, we urge you NOT to reduce funding for the 
DOE's Adult Handicapped Program.

Caseworker was wrong to deceive, but my biggest question, why did it take so long
for the family to inquire about the little girl....curiosity...grandmother's and mother's
bank account before and after the little girl disappeared.....amount of money change at all.....

another problem with caseworkers that have such an overwhelming caseload, they
become tired and become very relaxed in their job.

Sad thing is this little girl will bring to light many questions that should have been asked and done before she disappeared...

Government Worker in U.S. Fired for Speaking English 


An employee of Miami-Dade County, harassed by Latino co-workers for being a white American, says she was fired for speaking English on the job. 


"I was referred to as the gringa, the Americana," Zita Wilensky told Miami's WSVN-TV. "Did they mean it in a polite way or a derogatory way? In some ways, at times, it was joking. But then it was like every single day, and you know what? I have a name." 


She was the only "Anglo" in the Domestic Violence Unit. All of her co-workers were Hispanic, and she says they liked to play tricks on her. 


"My boss presented me with an envelope one day when the anthrax was going around and told me: 'Come here; could you smell this? This just came in the mail.' Big joke in front of the whole department. Made me look like an idiot." 


A 16-year county employee, she has a personnel file full of letters of praise, but the racial discrimination began to take its toll. 


"Then Zita was told she had to speak Spanish in the office. She was given 60 days to learn. After 30 days her boss disguised her voice and called her," WSVN reported. 


Wilensky told the station: "So she called pretending to be someone who didn't speak English." 


"And when you could not communicate she fired you?" 


"Yes ... that's how it happened." 


According to the county, she was fired (merely) for transferring the call to the clerk's office. Wilensky says she transferred it because she wanted what she thought was a Spanish-speaking caller to talk to someone. Her boss claims she just requested that Wilensky learn Spanish, but a letter from the boss says Wilensky must speak Spanish, the TV station reported. 


The result: After her long service with the county, she was fired and replaced by a Hispanic. 


Now she is looking into whether an American can be fired for not speaking Spanish on the job. 


WSVN says that according to its legal expert, Howard Finkelstein: "The Florida Constitution says that English is the official language of the government. So you can't fire someone simply because they don't speak Spanish, and you can't fire them simply because they are Anglo. That's discrimination. That's illegal." 


Finkelstein added: "An employer cannot allow an employee to be subjected to racial slurs like 'gringo' or to be ridiculed or intimidated. ... That's called a hostile work environment, and that's illegal." 


If Wilensky sues the county, she has an excellent chance of winning, he said. 


The banana republic of Miami-Dade County, by the way, is the same government that failed to  <http://www.newsmax.com/showinside.shtml?a=2001/10/26/165850> fire three black firemen who refused to respond to emergency calls until an "offensive" American flag was removed from a fire truck.

I gave an interview today with the ABC affiliate, pointing out that
government was never designed to function as either a father or mother
to a child.  Unfortunately, we have been thrust into this role due to
abuse, abandonment, or neglect by the father, mother, or other
relatives.  The system ultimately comes down to its lowest common
denominator; the human being with the responsibility to love and nurture
these children.  We must never lose sight of the fact that the system is
absolutely imperfect and although you, Kate Kearney and so many others
have done so much for Florida's children, we have both an imperfect
society, and an imperfect system.  While these tragedies must be
prevented, we will always have them as long as parents and relative
caregivers fail and refuse to fulfill their moral and legal
responsibilities.

Our thoughts and prayers are with you.  The Holder family loves you
dearly and appreciates your efforts.

Governor Bush, 

      I am forwarding a copy of an e-mail I recently sent to Michael Moore, DOC secretary.  I would like you to read it.  You may feel it does not concern you, but as the governor of our state, I think you should be aware of what goes on in agencies you are ultimately responsible for. 
       
      The issues facing my daughter are particularly troublesome to me, because she's been in a prison setting since she was 15-years-old, and I know how fragile her state of mind is.  As I mentioned to Mr. Moore, as her mother, I do not like to see my daughter mistreated and feel I must try to protect her in any way I can. I'm sure as a father you can understand that. 

Thank you,

Dear Governor Bush,
       	 I am still so excited and motivated by all of the information
shared at the two day Leadership Summit.  I am honored to have been invited.
I am a veteran principal charged with starting a new school in Polk County.
The physical facility is 90% complete and the staff nearly hired.
	 Thanks to the leadership and guidance of the Suncoast Area Center
for Educational Enhancement (SACEE) I have received ongoin updates on Just
Read, Florida.  I have been blessed to have three full days of staff
development with the new school staff and have summarily passed on the
information about the reading initiative to them.  This Friday I meet with
the fully assembled staff and I am thrilled to be the ambassador of all of
this great news.  We have already  been using the terminology from Just
Read, Florida and teachers have worked on polishing up their background
knowledge on reading pedagogy.  One of the speakers described your actions
as "picking up the gauntlet".  I want to tell you that you probably felt me
jerk it out of your hand and run all the way back to Polk County to be sure
I didn't leave anything out as I prepare for my Friday staff meeting. 
	Just Read, Florida and Reading First have paved the way for my staff
to refocus on a school's most important responsibility....teaching reading.
I have repeatedly touted the richness of the Sunshine State Standards to my
staff......but the strategies and research advocated in these reading
iniatives will be the glue that binds together all the academic areas at R.
Bruce Wagner Elementary.  Tools, materials, a road map, training, public
affirmation and a wonderful destination!  What more can we ask
for....welllllllll!
	I could go on forever.....but my thanks to you, your staff, SACEE,
for improving the academic futures of millions of boys and girls in
Florida!!!

Most sincerely,

Debra C. Edmiston

I am constantly hearing your commercials on the Florida education system and 
thought I would let you know about a success.  My daughter Samantha is in 
third grade at Meadowpark Elementary.  Before the school year started it was 
like pulling teeth to get her to read.  Early on in the year Samantha had a 
reading comprehension test and did very poorly and was very upset.  I am 
happy to say as the school year is coming to a close her scores have 
skyrocketed and she is make her way through Harry Potter Books.  Thank you!  
If you could send her some words of encourgement to keep up with her reading 
I know it would mean a lot.  Her name and address are:  Samantha D'Uva

Dear Governor:

I forgot to provide you with a little note from a foster family that is leaving fostering due to the system failures.  I realize that running a state is more difficult then running our foster/adoptive parent association.  But sometimes, I believe the problems are resolved because of the information I receive back.  Then the problem raises up to smack me in the face because I did not ask the correct questions from the individual(s) most affected.  Are you listening to the most affected?






Suzanne,

Thank you for responding.  I will remember and cherish fondly each and every child we were blessed to have in our home.  We begin fostering as what we thought would our "ministry."  But I must admit now that had we known then what we know now, things would have been much different.  Dealing daily with DCF, their incompetence, and endless redtape fails the children of Florida and is a disgrace to the wonderful, caring people that choose to foster.  Deciding to stop fostering was one of the most difficult decisions that we have ever had to make.  To say our hearts were torn out is an understatement.  But along with those children that touched our lives, our prayers are with the foster families as well as those who work for DCF.

Respectfully,
Tom and Pam

May 7, 2002

The Honorable Jeb Bush
Governor, State of Florida
Capital Building

Dear Governor Bush:

I am writing regarding Allen L. Register, County Judge in Washington County.

I understand that Judge Register is being consider for Circuit Judge of the
14th Circuit.  I have known Allen Register my whole life and honestly feel
he is one of the last good men in the world.  We are first cousins (our
fathers were brothers) and through the years have kept in contact with each
other.  He has the qualities that more people should try to obtain.

As a father, he stands by and with his children.  He is very supportive in
their activities, social and academic.  His relationship with his children
and wife is one of mutual respect, open communication and a very comfortable
and safe atmosphere.  Which tends to put everyone around him in the same
frame. 

Through the years he has been the solid ground for his family, for his
parents and siblings.  During all the personal and professional events, good
and not so good, in his life I think that his strong Christian beliefs has
carried him, along with his light-hearted sense of humor, through those
times.

I believe that Judge Register would carried these same qualities into this
new position.

Sincerely,

Deborah L. (Register) Johnson

RE:	HB 319

Governor Bush – I would urge you to sign HB 319 which 
essentially privatizes the work having been done for over a 
decade by the Florida Self-Insurance Guarantee Association in 
conjunction with the Department of Labor. 

This is a superb bill which further privatizes the role, scope and 
function of the Florida Self-Insurance Guarantee Association in 
relationship to paying Workers Compensation claims when 
companies in Florida enter bankruptcy.

The Florida Self-Insurance Program Board of Directors has an 
excellent track record in handling its assigned functions. 
Passage of this bill will decrease the number of state employees, 
increase the efficiency, cost less and thus would be a benefit to 
the business organizations of this state.

Thank you very much for considering this recommendation.

        The only equitable solution is for the Legislature to task the BOE to undertake a study, develop credible data and report before the next session.

Let's paws to chew on a trust law


Stephen Van Drake  
------------------------------------------------------------
   Things are looking up for cats Sugar and CeeCee Jr. and Marvin the dog.

   The top dog in their household, Gov. Jeb Bush, last week signed a bill
   that would allow Florida pet owners to set up trusts for pets.

   "This bill will allow man and woman's best friends to be taken care of
   if their masters pass on," Bush said.

   "There are a lot of orphaned animals," said Bobbie Ozer of the Animal
   Rescue League of the Palm Beaches in West Palm Beach. She said she
   strongly favors the new law.

   Florida's pet trust law takes effect Jan. 1. The state joins 17 other
   states with similar probate laws permitting pet owners to designate a
   trustee to spend the money in such a trust for the animal's care.

   "Many Floridians treat their furry friends like family," said Barbara
   Buxton of Aventura, who has a law degree in estate planning. "They
   deserve this."

   She said one of her clients, Bobbi Ford of Delray Beach ­ "proud mother
   of two golden retrievers" ­ set aside $10,000 for her dogs.

   "Chelsea and Patches are my babies," Ford said. "These are defenseless
   creatures who are totally dependent on us. I would hate to think that
   they wouldn't be taken care of after we're gone."

   An increasing number of people own pets, from exotic birds and reptiles
   to horses and, of course, cats and dogs. Buxton said she's thrilled that
   Bush signed the pet trust bill on April 23.

   She can now amend her own will to include care for her Shih Tzu, Daisey
   Sue Dumpling.

 Law demands accountability
   The new law recognizes pet trusts and makes trustees accountable to the
   court for money spent taking care of a decedent's animals. If the
   trustee doesn't want to serve or has died, the court can appoint a
   trustee "having an interest in the welfare of the animal."

   A probate judge can also remove a trustee. The new code sets out a
   method of distributing the remainder of the trust once the last of the
   animals dies.

   Before these formalized pet trusts, pet owners set up an "honorary
   trust," said David Westfall, Harvard University Law School probate
   professor. The trustee, however, could spend the money without any
   accountability, Westfall said.

   "I think the trend is with the Florida statute," he said.

   "The new pet trust law is practical and reasonable, a loving way to
   exit," Buxton said.

   Pets are generally known to help lower blood pressure, reduce mental
   depression and provide a host of other benefits to their owners, Buxton
   said. "It's a very responsible way to provide for a pet when they go."

   Some pets, such as cockatoos, which can live 80 years, will outlast
   their owners.

   Pet estate planning might well become a growth industry, Buxton noted.

 Third of homes have cats or dogs
   At least a third of all homes in the United States have a dog or a cat,
   according to a survey conducted last year by the American Pet Products
   Manufacturing Association of Greenwich, Conn.

   The association's survey concluded that more than 63 million U.S.
   households own pets and nearly 47 percent of these own more than one
   type of pet.

   The new Florida code doesn't discriminate. It refers to "animal." So,
   the Wellington polo horse owner could provide for the horse; the reptile
   lover, for a python, and so it goes.

   Pet trusts also open the door for inventive charitable giving.

   For example, Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., last year introduced a bill
   currently lingering in the House Ways and Means Committee that would
   provide tax benefits to "charitable remainder pet trusts."

   In short, the remainder of the trust might pour over into a charity,
   such as the Animal Rescue League or other charities.

   The remainder would then be tax-deductible, said Bill Andrews, another
   Harvard law professor. His colleague Westfall agreed.

   "It would make a good development vehicle, say to prospective donors,
   after the pet dies."

Gentlemen,
Unlike federal employees, Florida state employees are dependent on you. 2.5 % is not a lot of money. The good ones deserve much more.  Please pay them what they deserve. They work harder than teachers and most do not loose children.  Our state employees deserve at least as much as teachers.

Dear Governor Bush -

I am Izzy Rommes, Commander of the 160th MP Bn which was mobilized in 
January. You attended our ceremony, and also gave me your email address 
if we needed anything. Something has come up pertaining to the state 
which I hope you can assist with. I work for the Department of 
Agriculture and have also asked them to assist with this matter.

My wife received a letter today from Bill Hoard / Employee Benefit 
Consultants who provides the DACS insurance administraton. The letter 
stated my insurance would be cancelled after 6 months of active duty, 
and this will occur in June. I am presently paying for life and extra 
medical coverage. The state also provides life and medical as I am a 
select exempt employee.

I do not know what insurance is referred to, but whether it is 
insurance which I pay for or insurance provided by the state, I do not 
believe my insurance should be terminated. Terminating insurance seems 
contrary to the soldiers and sailors relief act and clearly is 
detrimental to all of the reservists who are state employees and were 
called to active duty.

Thank you for listening and for any assistance you can render in this 
matter.

FYI our unit will be leaving for Guantanimo Bay soon and we will fly 
the Florida flag which you gave us as soon as we occupy the site.

Subject: Graduation Diploma


Dear Governor Bush,
My name is Theresa Danzey, and it the last name sounds familiar it is because my husband is Ron Danzey, School Board Member in Bay County.  I have a situation I would like to share with you concerning my son Andrew.
 
First of all, I agree and support testing like the HSCT and FCAT, however this is what has happened in my family.  Andrew is a LD student and was identified as such in and elementary school 10 years ago.  Andrew is about to complete High School and has done everything he was supposed to do.  He made A’s, B’s, C’s and one or two D’s through out his high school years. His attendance has been good and his classroom work has been good.  Our situation is that he has taken the HSCT for the 4th time.  He has passed the math portion, but has fell a few points from passing the language portion. (This is his LD area) I do not feel it is fair for a student who had accomplished everything that has been asked of him to not be allowed a graduation diploma. A certificate of completion does not amply provide or state his accomplishments.  There must be another option for All students who do not test well or have learning disabilities or just learn a different way.
 
This situation has really broken my heart, because I have watched him work hard for the last 4 years and now it apparent that it is all in vain because of ONE test given; instead of looking at the whole child.  Is there anything you can do to help my son?
 
I hope that you and others with our children at heart can take another look at options that will help my son and those like him.
 
Thank you so much for all you do and  for taking time to listen to my concern!
Theresa

I was pleased to see that you created a Blue Ribbon Panel of some of our finest citizens to review the child welfare department in Miami. I am sure that with their expertise and commitment that they will be effective. 

I wanted to let you know that I have served for the past three years as the Chairperson of the Florida Bar Commission on the Legal Needs of Children and that we have spent substantial time reviewing the needs of children who find themselves in our court system and in our foster care system. We produced an Interim Report last year and we are drafting our Final Report at this time. The Secretary of DCF served on our commission as did a wide variety of experts in child advocacy from around the state, including Representative Sandra Murman and Senator Burt Saunders.

I would be happy to send you our interim recommendations and our final recommendations which should be complete by the end of May. This may be of some help to the panel and for the purpose of long range planning as the commissioners did extensive research on children's issues. <<Special Committee Commission on the Legal Needs of Children.url>> I am including this link to our web site so that you can see our members and some of our work.

thanks Dave. 
 
Part of the problem is part of the solution. We opened the spicket with the Keyla bill that requires more people to call the hotline. the funnel has increased by law and the number of kids in the system is actually lower than 1998. I think this is a good thing but it creates more angst since more calls are being investigated. 
 
You and I must know that being a child welfare investigator is a really difficult job. You are asked to make judgements that a mom and dad should have already done. Sadly, wholesome family life is not always the norm in Florida. 
 
thanks to the Florida Legislature in the last three years, we have nearly doubled the funding for our child welfare system. Case loads have dropped, quality assurance funding and implementation is up, the technology project will begin to bear fruit, more kids are being adopted, more mental health and drug treatment funding are  going to parents who have lost their way, and perhaps most importantly, we are moving to a community based care model that gets DCF out of the direct business of caring for kids that are neglected and abused. I honestly think we are on the right track and I intend to use this tragic case as a means to accelerate our efforts to improve the system. 
 
Dave, should our review find that there is a systemic problem with our current system, I will take the necessary action.

Good Morning Gov.
 
This e-mail that I am forwarding to you is just one of many situations I have heard about DCFS since taking office.   I know you have taken a personal interest in the case of the missing child Rilya  in Miami.  I would venture to say 50 % of constituents calls are about incidents with DCF. When it finally gets into the Court System our hands are tied.  When it involves children it is confidential information.  The staff as DCF are in some cases are heartless. I know this is one of the hazards of the job. But common sense needs to be exercised when some vindictive neighbor for one reason or another use DCF as a way of revenge and cause families undo harassment and harm to not only the institution of the family but harm the children mentally.  Thank you for your " LETS GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS" AGENCY and start helping families instead of doing more harm.   We need an audit of finances, as well as workers capabilities and not tell us what we want to hear.  Right now things are in an uproar in that Agency, and we need accountability.

Subject: A concern


Greetings and good morning Rep Russell.
 
You don't know me, but I am a registered voter in Dist 44.  In 1994, my family was almost destroyed by the DCFS (then known as HRS) because of false allegations that were made by incompetent and untrained case workers. When we dared to stand up to their gestapo tactics, HRS did EVERYTHING in their power to destroy us.  By the time HRS backed down, my family was torn apart and it cost us 70K.  All charges (which were based on hearsay and based on NO tangible evidence what so ever) were dropped to the dismay of the HRS case workers.  They appealed but to no avail. HRS continued to harass my family for months.  HRS never did apologize despicable behavior.  My wife and I went on to worked with SEN Steve Wise on getting new laws passed to prevent future HRS abuse.
 
As a commissioned officer with the U.S. Army (Military Police/CID), I am stationed away from my home in Florida, but I still keep on top of current events in my home town (Spring Hill) and home state.  I am a conscientious voter. Because of being stationed away from home, I can no longer be as active in helping families who are falsely and maliciously attached by DCFS as I once was.  I can however, communicate to my legislative representative and look to see that he/she is doing what is necessary to ensure that DCFS is doing their job responsibly to protect children and families alike.
 
 
Now, the purpose of this e-mail is to express a concern regarding a new license for DCFS to over react.
 
When I can get a free moment to catch up on Florida news, I can't help but notice that DCFS and their failures are once again in the lime light.  Most of the attention appears to be directed towards DCFS' continuing failures which are resulting the the "misplacement" and injury and death to children.  We both know that some of these unforgivable results are because DCFS continues to focus much energy and resources towards persecuting good wholesome families who stand up to DCFS gestapo tactics; families who have been attacked by DCFS based on pure hearsay and unsubstantiated speculations.
 
I can foresee that with all the new attention given DCFS failures resulting in death, injury and lost children, they will increase their gestapo tactics and cast a wide net - just so they can say "look at all the children we have taken into custody now Governor Bush.  Aren't we doing a great job now"  
 
I hope that the governor will take strong action to force DCFS to do its job responsibly and NOT to go after families unless there is clear articulated evidence that abuse and neglect exists - and not destroy families based on hearsay - which as you know is a common practice by DCFS.  I hope that the legislature will demand that DCFS does its job to protect BOTH children from dangerous situations AND families from false persecution by DCFS.
 
If only we could convince the legislature and the governor to take DCFS out of the criminal investigations business and put investigations of child abuse crimes in law enforcement hands.
 
Thank you for allowing this Florida  citizen the opportunity to express a concern.  
 
Thank you.

Dear Gov. Bush

Thank you for signing the Relative Care Giver Bill.   I am a grandparent that has written you several times and thank you for you email answers and support. However statute 39.509 did not protect my visitation rights after parental rights for my daughter were terminated.

So I turned my energies to Kinship Care.  I was one of the 100 Grandmothers that stormed the capital to support our House Bill #161 and Senate Bill #360.  Also thanks for hearing my friend Carolyn Palmer in Lakeland story about the needs for Grandparents Rights.

With the events of the abuse and neglect of CFS in the past few weeks, I am saddened by the attacks upon you.  Let me assure you of my support.  With God's help we can make Florida an outstanding state with Grandparents rights.

Both you and I know that Florida's greatest resource is our children.  With God's help we can be NO #1 in the country!!!

Peace

A broken hearted Grandmother

P.S.  My Church St. Paul's Lutheran Church in Clearwater has allowed us to have a support group for Grandparents, I trust that some monies connected to the Relative Care Giver funds will be available to support  Kinship Care Givers.  I wish I could have contact with Jenny and John, but maybe God has other plans.  We will be up lobbying for the 2003 Session.

Education finished, bumping: Abel grants, community college distribution, PECO. We got $9m reading money, the $1.2m teacher liability insurance. They went to $9m on the SUS "equity" issue.

HHS just finished, bumping several items, including residential group homes, community mental health expansion, guardian ad litem (all McKay issues), as well as the medically needy, community based care risk pool. They did agree to cut all member projects 10%.

The senate is in session at 9:00a. Nothing will happen on the budget until the Miami bill is settled...that may mean that the senate would have to come back Thursday for third reading on the Miami bill before the budget gets settled...we need to see what happens to the bill on second tomorrow.

Hi Waymond,
 
So, here is the outline I will be presenting to anyone who will listen:
 
1.  I tried to talk the Fl Lottery into using the Internet to increase their sales.
2.  I am a CEO of a Tallahassee based company who is dedicated to the growth of this region and this state and who has 6 other Lotteries as clients
3.  I presented new ideas (patent pending) to the Lottery through demos with you and David for the past 2 years
4.  You stalled me based on legal issues you said you had and I worked with Ken hart, at your direction, to solve these issues
5.  you deployed a solution on your own (good for you if it is good for the Lottery and the state and as long as it does not infringe on my patents and as long as it is legal)
 
I have invested time, money, and energy into this solution (IMARCS) and I took the time to educate you and your staff and in return you bypass me.  I understand this approach and actually respect it...it creates competition.  Up till now...however, I have supported you and David consistently, that is over and we are now playing on a different field.  I went to your site today at www.fllottery.com , clicked on the bravenet link (your survey and polling system) and was taken to an illegal gambling site...endorsed, obviously, by the Florida Lottery since you have it on your site. (the link actually exposes me, the lottery consumer, to over 100 illegal gambling sites)
 
I want to be perfectly clear.  For close to a year I have told you that your Lottery site has hyperlinks on your website that takes consumers to www.gambling.com.  You have not responded to these emails or phone calls...you have taken no measures to stop it and you have even expand on it.  I have no other option than to make sure that people who will take responsibility see this.  I want only the best for the Lottery and for the state.  You have absolutely disregarded my consultation and advice.  The federal wire act that is being redefined will charge the State of Florida with a violation for exposing (and driving) consumers to off-shore gambling sites.  If I didn't knpw better I would wonder if these overseas gambling sites are paying you for this exposure.

Hi Jeb,

How are you doing?  Well, I hope.
We are doing alright, my boys are doing wonderful.  My older son Tristan, is 
18 months now, and my baby Sebastian is 2 months.
I am writing you to ask you for a favor.
Doug is being honorably discharged from the military at the end of the 
month, and we are trying to locate employment for him in the tampa bay area. 
  He has applied for a State job, Marine Mechanic for Hillsborough County. 
(Position number 07196, class code 6552) And I was wondering if you could 
put in a good work for him. (I know you don't know him very well, and if you 
don't feel comfortable I understand).  He wants to work for the state, or 
one of the cities, I believe he also applied with the city of Clearwater and 
Temple Terrace.
I am planning on getting my real estate license when I get home and working 
part time.  I still want to be able to stay home most of the time with my 
boys, but its getting difficult to live on one income. So, I figure I am a 
good salesperson and will do well in Real Estate.
Well, I appreciate you taking the time to read this, and considering my 
favor.
Love Gina

PS are you running for office again?  We will be glad to support you with 
our time,  and Tristan will love the sign waving! :)

Subject: Department of Children & Families


Dear Jeb,
 
I regret that I have to write you this e-mail at a time when you are already faced with mounting problems with the Department of Families and Children but a problem arrived on my doorstep unexpectedly and I can't just turn away.  
 
Over the weekend, Debbie brought a co-worker, Stefani home to join our family for a Sunday BBQ. Debbie had expressed concern for this girl because she had no parents and said her landlord wasn't very nice to her, so we decided to have her join us for a family day.   During the day, Stephani, who is 16,  told us about the exorbitant rent her landlord was charging her.  She explained that she pays over $600 per month rent for a room in the home of an employee (case worker) of the Department of Families & Children.  In addition,  the woman charges her extra for food, telephone and other incidentals, and gets angry when she has to pick Stefani up from work.   
 
If that wasn't bad enough, last night, the woman told the girl to "Pick up your sh#$ and get out!!"   Being 16, the girl the only person she knew she could call, a 19-year-old former foster sister to come get her.   She was picked up and spent the night with her foster sister.  To make matters even worse, the landlord/caseworker, reported the girl as a runaway today, and then had the girl's only means of communication, her cell phone (that Stephani pays for) shut off.
 
Before her phone was shut off, Stefani called Debbie  asking her what she should do.  Debbie handed the phone to me, and I have spent an entire day trying to find this girl some help.  To me, this is an inexcusable situation . . . certainly not as heinous as that of the missing 5-year-old, but certainly of major concern when those in charge of  protecting these kids are the ones taking advantage of them.
 
I have contacted a family court judge, the public defender's office, the state attorney and Gus Bilirakis's office and am awaiting replies.   When I spoke with the State Attorney's office I was told I needed to contact the girl's caseworker.   When I explained that the problem was with one of the case workers in the same office, they still insisted that I would have to talk with the case worker if there is a problem.  It seem to me, that calling the case worker who placed the girl with a co-worker who is charging this girl rent plus is liking asking the "wolf to watch the hen house!"  I was so baffled by the response, that I asked the person at the State Attorney's office if there was anyone who looked out for children in these situations and the answer I received was "I don't know.  You have to call the case worker."    
 
I'm sure there are all kinds of rules and regulations that I don't know and probably wouldn't understand.   But what I do know is that this "case" is not a number but a child, without any parents, who is working hard to maintain an 3.5 GPA in High School, works 30-40 hrs a week, and is being grossly taking advantage of by the very people who should be looking out for her.   I can't even explain how disgusted and frustrated I am.
 
I realize you can't get involved in all the individual cases all around the state, but considering the current scrutiny of this department, I wanted to share this situation since it seems to involve employees of the department using their positions in an improper way.
 
I will continue to work with the professionals locally until we can find a suitable solution for Stefani.  My only concern is that I am leaving on Monday for a trip to Washington D.C. with Debbie & Lisa. Although our main purpose of the trip is for Debbie to visit Georgetown University where she is seriously considering applying to the  School of Foreign Service, we plan to send a couple of extra days touring the city, since neither of the girls have ever visited before.  We planned the trip early so when Debbie returns she can begin her search for a summer job/internship or volunteer position with an agency or organization associated with International or Latin American Relations to further explore her possible career choice.   
 
Although I'm really excited and looking forward to taking Debbie & Lisa to Washington, I am very concerned with leaving Stefani.  I hope we can get her situation resolved before I leave on Monday, but I'm not very optimistic at this point.  
 
Regardless of what happens with the Department and Stefani's immediate situation, I have decided that I will continue to meet and work with Stefani and be an adult she can trust and count on.  She seems to be a remarkable young lady who has dreams and goals and appears to have the strength of character to overcome her difficult childhood to achieve them.  I only I hope I can help her see them come true.  
 
Thank you for listening.   
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Sandy Faulkner

In response to our discussion, it is very important that we use some
strategy to balance flexibility and choice with budget parameters. If we
allow families maximum flexibility and choice with no budget parameters, we
will be in a program deficit again next year. Just as we experienced
significant resistance to managed care type arrangements (especially for the
disabled) it is difficult for most stakeholders to accept any type of
monetary limit. It is critical that the increased flexibility and choice are
tied to a budget based on individual needs especially when we try to
promulgate policies into administrative rule. This will require the
assessment tool and budget/rate analysis included in the RFP to be completed
first. The assessment tool, individual budgets based on level of need
(derived from the assessment) and standardized provider rates are the most
controversial because they are all linked to the bottom line; money. 

If all the good news is implemented first (flexibility, greater choice,
direct provider billing, reduced workload and paperwork for support
coordinators, fair and equitable rates) and then we try to phase in budget
parameters based on level of need, it will be extremely difficult to gain
any kind of stakeholder buy-in and phase 2 (not so good news) will be
challenged and protested in rule hearings.

As I mentioned earlier, it would be similar to handing everyone in the
consumer directed care program a Platinum American Express Card with no
limits instead of the monthly cash budget they work within now based on
their LTC needs. (Or worse, giving the CDC participant the credit card first
and then explaining limitations and credit card dept later).

 Another gross comparison would be handing a 16 yr old the keys to a new car
on his birthday and then announcing at the end of the month that he will
need to make car payments, buy car insurance and baby-sit his sister every
Friday night.

Unlike capitated arrangements, prior authorization or other more traditional
delivery models and cost containment methods, this model gives the consumer,
not the provider or the government, maximum choice and control over their
long term care needs.

I had a fantastic, 2 hour strategy session with Accenture yesterday. We are developing the statewide business case for enterprise licenses.  We plan to lay out two or three innovative funding and integration options for an enterprise licensing solution to be used for licensing processes at 10 agencies.  As we work through the overall strategy, the initial focus will be on the convergence of the DBPR, DOH and AHCA Versa systems and business processes. I want to ensure that Dr. John, Dr. Medows and Secretary Binkley-Seyer clearly understand how we get from where we are today to the vision of enterprise licensing that we all share. The plan is to have this decision paper completed near the end of next week.
 
While the current Versa solution at DBPR is workable, there are a few technical shortcomings that Versa must address prior to or to extending this solution to DOH and AHCA.  Versa is a small company but a good one and they understand the potential benefits of ensuring that their product is "robust" and scalable.    Accenture and I agreed to work together to ensure that Versa places the appropriate priority and focus on the immediate resolution of these problems.

Governor and Kathleen, The STO's Microsoft Agreement is exceeding our expectations!  We have 21,400 seats already signed up for an actual savings of $2,298,061.   We have 35,150 seats from county and city organizations in the pipeline for completion by June.  Additionally, we're working with the remaining state agencies to transition their current Microsoft coverage to the new Enterprise Agreement which will result in continued significant savings.

I met with both Raymond and Kim today to discuss the current Microsoft Enterprise Agreement progress to date.  The end result thus far is that $2.3M have been saved thus far by the new agreement.  In discussions with some of other the CIO’s recently, I became aware that not all of them totally understood the agreement.  We thought that it would be a good idea to report the details of the agreement to the CIO council to clear up any questions.  I would like to accomplish this next week if you are amenable?  15-30 minutes depending on questions should suffice.

Dear Jeb,
 
I regret that I have to write you this e-mail at a time when you are already faced with mounting problems with the Department of Families and Children but a problem arrived on my doorstep unexpectedly and I can't just turn away.  
 
Over the weekend, Debbie brought a co-worker, Stefani home to join our family for a Sunday BBQ. Debbie had expressed concern for this girl because she had no parents and said her landlord wasn't very nice to her, so we decided to have her join us for a family day.   During the day, Stephani, who is 16,  told us about the exorbitant rent her landlord was charging her.  She explained that she pays over $600 per month rent for a room in the home of an employee (case worker) of the Department of Families & Children.  In addition,  the woman charges her extra for food, telephone and other incidentals, and gets angry when she has to pick Stefani up from work.   
 
If that wasn't bad enough, last night, the woman told the girl to "Pick up your sh#$ and get out!!"   Being 16, the girl the only person she knew she could call, a 19-year-old former foster sister to come get her.   She was picked up and spent the night with her foster sister.  To make matters even worse, the landlord/caseworker, reported the girl as a runaway today, and then had the girl's only means of communication, her cell phone (that Stephani pays for) shut off.
 
Before her phone was shut off, Stefani called Debbie  asking her what she should do.  Debbie handed the phone to me, and I have spent an entire day trying to find this girl some help.  To me, this is an inexcusable situation . . . certainly not as heinous as that of the missing 5-year-old, but certainly of major concern when those in charge of  protecting these kids are the ones taking advantage of them.
 
I have contacted a family court judge, the public defender's office, the state attorney and Gus Bilirakis's office and am awaiting replies.   When I spoke with the State Attorney's office I was told I needed to contact the girl's caseworker.   When I explained that the problem was with one of the case workers in the same office, they still insisted that I would have to talk with the case worker if there is a problem.  It seem to me, that calling the case worker who placed the girl with a co-worker who is charging this girl rent plus is liking asking the "wolf to watch the hen house!"  I was so baffled by the response, that I asked the person at the State Attorney's office if there was anyone who looked out for children in these situations and the answer I received was "I don't know.  You have to call the case worker."    
 
I'm sure there are all kinds of rules and regulations that I don't know and probably wouldn't understand.   But what I do know is that this "case" is not a number but a child, without any parents, who is working hard to maintain an 3.5 GPA in High School, works 30-40 hrs a week, and is being grossly taking advantage of by the very people who should be looking out for her.   I can't even explain how disgusted and frustrated I am.
 
I realize you can't get involved in all the individual cases all around the state, but considering the current scrutiny of this department, I wanted to share this situation since it seems to involve employees of the department using their positions in an improper way.
 
I will continue to work with the professionals locally until we can find a suitable solution for Stefani.  My only concern is that I am leaving on Monday for a trip to Washington D.C. with Debbie & Lisa. Although our main purpose of the trip is for Debbie to visit Georgetown University where she is seriously considering applying to the  School of Foreign Service, we plan to send a couple of extra days touring the city, since neither of the girls have ever visited before.  We planned the trip early so when Debbie returns she can begin her search for a summer job/internship or volunteer position with an agency or organization associated with International or Latin American Relations to further explore her possible career choice.   
 
Although I'm really excited and looking forward to taking Debbie & Lisa to Washington, I am very concerned with leaving Stefani.  I hope we can get her situation resolved before I leave on Monday, but I'm not very optimistic at this point.  
 
Regardless of what happens with the Department and Stefani's immediate situation, I have decided that I will continue to meet and work with Stefani and be an adult she can trust and count on.  She seems to be a remarkable young lady who has dreams and goals and appears to have the strength of character to overcome her difficult childhood to achieve them.  I only I hope I can help her see them come true.  
 
Thank you for listening.   
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Sandy Faulkner

I humbly disagree with my property rights brethren -- i do not see the Bush Administration advancing the creation of new national monuments under the antiquities act as Clinton did, and in fact see the Administration undoing many of the restrictions the Clinton administration placed on private use on public lands, such as snowmobiling, logging and mining.

Park Service Plans Massive New Land Grabs! 

Republican Appointees in the National Park Service are hatching a new 
attack 
on private property rights! 

A May 1, 2002 article in the Portland, Oregon newspaper, the Oregonian, 
shows how the Park Service seems to be out of control in the Bush 
Administration.  FULL  ARTICLE PRINTED  BELOW. 

At a meeting of Park Service superintendents in Portland this week the land 
grabbers were setting their sights on your land and other lands between 
national parks across America.  The proposal uses soft words and invokes 
children and wildlife to hide the real agenda, a huge land grab of private 
and Federal land. 

The first thing that occurs when parks are created is that large areas are 
designated off-limits, roads are closed, campgrounds shut down, public 
services reduced and the public limited to using as little as 5% to 10% of 
the land area of the park to recreate. For example, 95% of the new Death 
Valley National Park is wilderness, closed to the public! 

A current proposal to force people to use busses in Yosemite is one 
example. 
If the Park Service gets its way,  the public won't be able to visit 
Yosemite unless they are willing to ride a bus and stuff all their camping 
equipment on a bus.  People do not leave their urban area to be forced into 
another urbanized area.   The public is going to support parks less if they 
can't go there. 

See article below - using a sea lion as an illustration with no barriers in 
the ocean is exactly what the superintendents really want with the park 
corridors -- no barriers.  That means the loss of private land, grazing, 
farming, forestry, recreation and many other multiple uses that take place 
adjacent to the parks.  It means local communities losing tax base and 
economic support for schools and roads, often used by park personnel. 

This new initiative has support from Park Service Director Fran Mainella, a 
liberal Democrat.  How did a liberal Democrat get appointed to a top job in 
a Republican Administration?????  Simple - her former boss was Jeb Bush, 
the 
Governor of Florida and the President's brother. 

Mainella has, as you might expect, appointed two liberal Democrats to help 
her to trash private property rights and restrict recreational access to 
the 
parks.  Here they are, the National Park Service's two deputy directors: 

Deputy Director Randy Jones is was brought in after serving as Park 
Superintendent in Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado.  His claim to 
fame at Rocky Mountain was that he was opposed to any private land in the 
park and refused to set foot on private land if it was inside the park 
boundary.  He even attempted to prevent a 73 year old widow from repairing 
a 
bridge to her property, but was overruled by the Corps of Engineers. 
Jones's anti-private property stance is now guiding the Park Service. 

The other new Deputy Director is Don Murphy.  His claim to fame is 
spending the past four years running an outfit called Americans for 
Heritage 
and Recreation (AHR).  This was the umbrella group the ran the campaign 
to approve CARA, the Condemnation and Relocation Act, the infamous $47 
billion land acquisition trust fund!!!! 

Here is what Murphy thinks of private property rights.  This is the 
"Guiding 
Principles" from which he ran AHR: 

"AHR adamantly opposes any restrictions on the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund, especially those that limit acquisition, employ arbitrary geographic 
restrictions on the use of funds, require new authorizations, or prevent 
condemnation." 

Believe it or not, these are the liberal Democrats appointed by Interior 
Secretary Gale Norton to run the National Park Service.  Anti-private 
property rights, anti-recreation. 

The Park Service should be actually following the supposed Bush 
Administration agenda that they want to take care of the existing parks. 
It looks to us like the Park Service is spending more time on how it can 
expand the parks! 


ACTION ITEM: 

Call and e-mail your Congressman and both Senators.  Let them know you 
oppose more land acquisition funding and ask them to vote against HR 701, 
CARA, the Condemnation and Relocation Act, and S.990, the "Son of CARA" 
Land Grab. 

Urge them to question the funding for massive "wildlife" connecting 
corridors and additional expansion plans by the Park Service.   Wildlife is 
just being used an excuse 
for land use controls.  Tell them to force the Park Service to take care of 
what they already have, instead of expanding their empire. 

You may call any Congressman or Senator at the Capitol Switchboard -- (202) 
224-3121 or the temporary FREE NUMBER  (800) 648-3516. 


The Oregonian  -- Portland, Oregon - 

Park Leaders See Value In Networking 

05/01/02 by Michael Milstein 

Spectacular national parks such as Crater Lake and Mount Rainier may be 
icons all by themselves, but they will lose their value to people and 
wildlife if they become lone refuges all by themselves, said national park 
superintendents who gathered Tuesday in Portland. 

Park superintendents from around the West focused on a Bush administration 
goal of building "seamless networks" of parks around the country. It does 
not involve creating new parks as much as building connections among 
famous and lesser-known national parks, plus the state parks, playgrounds 
and inner-city parks that may be the first place many children enjoy the 
outdoors. 

Such connections may be as simple as attracting children from Portland's 
city park programs to Crater Lake to admire its pristine water and 
wildlife, or as elaborate as a parklike path for people to Rollerblade 
from Mount Rainier to Puget Sound. 

By building such connections, park managers will inevitably create 
corridors that also serve wildlife, they said. Without them, isolated 
national parks will become overcrowded final refuges for wildlife and an 
increasingly urban society trying to escape the development and sprawl 
that go with it. 

"That's the future of Mount Rainier if we don't save all that stuff from 
Mount Rainier to Puget Sound," said Jon Jarvis, superintendent of Mount 
Rainier National Park. "It becomes the last place wildlife has to go, but 
also the last place for recreation." 

The new initiative has support from National Park Service Director Fran 
Mainella and Interior Secretary Gale Norton, said Randy Jones, deputy 
director of the Park Service. They and park managers see it extending the 
reach of national parks to city residents who otherwise may lose touch 
with such natural places and the reasons for protecting them. 

"We have enjoyed tremendous support for the parks, but we have to make 
sure the parks remain essential to what is becoming our new and diverse 
constituency in this new century," said Chuck Lundy, superintendent of 
Crater Lake National Park. 

Studies in California have found that wildlife uses even tenuous links 
between park and forestland that involve crossing bridges over an 
interstate, said John Reynolds, regional director of the Park Service. A 
sea lion tagged at Point Reyes near San Francisco turned up in Russia this 
year, evidence of long-distance connections between wildlands, he said. 

The Bush administration has made national parks the core of its 
environmental strategy, vowing to repair the backlog of almost $1 billion 
worth of decaying buildings and potholed roads. 

But Liz Raisbeck of the National Parks and Conservation Association told 
superintendents Tuesday that her group is concerned "the pendulum may be 
swinging heavily" toward more intensive uses of parks that could damage 
them. She mentioned administration moves to compromise policies that could 
have banned snowmobiles and Jet Skis in parks. 

Donald Leal of the Political Economy Research Center, a free market think 
tank in Bozeman, Mont., said parks could control such uses by charging 
higher fees to account for the noise and pollution they may emit. 

"Don't send the idea that recreation is free -- it does have costs; it 
does have impacts," Leal said. "There is no mechanism in place that tells 
people who are using the parks, who are using the snowmobiles, that they 
have to bear some of the cost."

Despite his daily challanges, he graduates from our public High School soon with all A's and one B each reporting period for the last 3 years, as well as all A's at Marchman Adult Education Center's  2 year Culinary Arts Program. We are going to have some party! In attendance will be current and past teachers and principals to help celebrate his/their success.
I know you are a very busy man, but my request is that would you please just send a line of congratulations that I could read at this occasion?
Joe is an inspiration to all around him, he deserves all of the accolades that the evening will bring.

Dear Governor Jeb Bush, 

I haven't reviewed the Bill yet, but am pleased to see more serious action being taken. This will be a feather in your hat. 
This is the kind of strong gov't we need. 
I hope the actual bill and committee notes are as pleasing as this sounds. 

"A Senate committee passed a bill on Tuesday toughening criminal penalties for any state worker falsifying records. The measure creates three felony-level penalties for knowingly falsifying records on anyone under the state's supervision. The bill now moves to the full chamber"

Subject:	Your Blue Ribbon Choices

Hi Jeb, 
Regarding your Blue Ribbon Panel to "investigate Rilya": 

While your Blue Ribbon Choices may sound "impressive" because of their "job categories", they are hardly familiar with law, procedures in Juvenile Dependency, and all the goings on in "The System". 
I doubt they will be of any real effect, other than to smooth over everything for you public relations wise. 
Would be nice if you were more sincere. 

I could provide you with names of professionals with a much better familiarity and knowledge of the system, who would provide a more concrete investigation and suggestions for problems solving in the system, if impressive sounding individuals are what you want. 

Appointing the wrong people for such a task, is not a feather in your hat, but an acknowledgement that you have no serious intentions about these problems than winning your election..and to others who may not perceive it as such, that you yourself are ignorant of what goes on in the system. But we all know you are not. You have receive plenty of complaints. 
You were not concerned with these matters until the publicity, despite all the complaint letters you receive, and all the in person complaints you have received. 

Jeb, I know you can be a better man and political leader than that. 
But I gave up on you this year. Just like you are taking advantage of the "election year", we too were hoping to at least get a few good changes out of that same motive, but for good rather than votes. 

I am sure you will only do the minimum necessary to win in 2002. 

Sad it is, and a true pity for real American families, be they single parent or 2 parent homes. Too bad Sept 11 didn't bring out the real red, white and blue in you.

Subject:	College Market

Jeb,

I wanted to share this column by my colleague Mike Lynch, who is Reason magazine's national correspondent. He examines several recent reports on the cost and availability of college in the United States. As Mike explains, "in the higher ed market, there's something for everyone. Which is why the classrooms are full."  

Costly Education
By Mike Lynch <mailto:mwlynch@reason.com>

There's always something to worry about -- and for the government to spend more money on. 

The cost of college is never far down the list.

Back in January, the Lumina Foundation, which is spending a wad of cash kicked off from the student loan business, announced that Americans enjoy unequal access <http://www.luminafoundation.org/monographs/states/pdfs/Web.pdf> to higher education, since the wealthy can more easily afford to pay full freight. And last week the National Center for Public Policy in Higher Education delivered a study <http://www.highereducation.org/reports/losing_ground/ar3.shtml> that shows that the cost of public colleges and universities has gone up over the last 20 years. 

Yet if higher education is becoming unaffordable, someone has forgotten to tell students, who've increased <http://www.census.gov/prod/2002pubs/01statab/educ.pdf> from 8.6 million in 1970 to 14.5 million in 1998. Maybe this is because even as the sticker price of a college degree has increased, the returns to claiming one have shot up <http://www.acenet.edu/hena/facts_in_brief/1999/04_26_99_fib.cfm> as well. 

It's not as if governments have been neglecting the issue-college is clearly of great concern to middle and upper-middle class voters. In recent years, the federal and state governments have created and then liberalized the rules on tax-advantaged savings accounts, both Education IRAs <http://www.fool.com/money/allaboutiras/allaboutiras10.htm> and 529 plans <http://www.savingforcollege.com/>. And the average price of tuition, which appears strikingly high when quoted out of context, masks the tremendous diversity of the collection of institutions of higher learning, which include everything from inexpensive and extremely flexible junior colleges to extremely expensive elite liberal arts schools.

Indeed, one dares say that in the higher ed market, there's something for everyone. Which is why the classrooms are full.
 
Mike Lynch <mailto:mwlynch@reason.com> is Reason's national correspondent.


My hope is that someday "there will be something for everyone," in the K-12 education system.

Thank you for your continued support of Reason's education work.

Best,

Lisa

Jeb - several weeks ago I sent my resignation in from the Board of Optometry.  I was going through two major surgeries and I felt I had to resign because I didn't think I could do the job justice.  I am now well and I really miss the service on the board and the board members keep encouraging me to come back.  If I were to send you a letter would you consider reappointing me to the Board of Optometry? 

I understand my position has not been filled.

Subject:	The Rilya Wilson Case

Copy of what I sent to the Clerk of Court in Miami today. The offer stands 
for you as well.  Pat

Hi,

Yesterday I attempted to call Judge Cindy Lederman's office to leave a 
message for either a call back at another time or establish an email 
link.  It must have been a very busy day as it took several attempts to get 
a ring and the ensuing conversation was quite rushed. That's understandable 
given the situation.

I would however like to offer my observations about this case. You see, 
almost two years ago my own family's travails with the Florida DCF ended in 
total failure with the death of my elderly invalid stepmother. I 
established contacts in that case as a representative of the extended 
family with DCF attempting to re-establish contact between my stepmother 
and the family when it was suddenly cut by a young unrelated caregiver. I 
quickly learned the ins and outs of dealing with the DCF both on a local 
and state level as the case eventually widened to involve no less than 
three counties (Volusia, Orange and Brevard) and a variety of law 
enforcement departments. I fought it as far as the Governor's office 
establishing a link there by both phone and email. You can imagine how I 
felt when I saw Rilya's case in the news. Even my friends commented on the 
similarities of Rilya's case to my battle. Some of the names I saw 
mentioned there were some of the same people that I dealt with. I 
understand them all too well.

I think that if someone there has the time to speak with me I could be of 
assistance in understanding the ramifications of  the actions by DCF. I 
could possibly save you some time and grief.  I'm willing to do this 
because I hate to see another family hurt by a system that causes otherwise 
good people to do hurtful things.

Did I just hint that I think the DCF is not all bad? Yes, I did. In a way 
they remind me of a cartoon character in the "Roger the Rabbit" movie, 
Jessica Rabbit. You might remember her catch phrase, "I'm not bad, I'm just 
drawn that way."  Well, a fair number of DCF employees are "not bad they're 
just totally overwhelmed."  Some times it takes someone who has enough 
distance in time and space with enough background in the subject to see 
more of what's really going on.  I think I might be just that person.

At any rate I only wanted to offer what assistance and insight that I might 
have to Judge Lederman. She looks and sounds like the kind of judge I wish 
I had met in Florida.  I put Rilya's picture on my computer screen to 
remind me to pray for her and her family.  I shall add all of you to that 
list as well.

Thank you.

FARM BILL GOES TO THE PRESIDENT 

FLORIDA FARMERS APPLAUD FOOD LABELING 


The U.S. Senate today approved the new Farm Bill. It now goes to the President who has indicated that he will sign it. The legislation includes a country-of-origin labeling requirement important to Florida growers and American consumers. The law calls for all imported fruits, vegetables, peanuts, meats and fish to be labeled with the country of origin on grocery store shelves. A similar law has been in force and appreciated by consumers in Florida since 1979.  Based on Florida’s experience, Senator Bob Graham and others have worked for a federal law, but each year the House of Representatives has blocked the measure.   

But earlier this year Congresswoman Mary Bono of California in a late night maneuver succeeded in passing a floor amendment to the Farm Bill. In 1998 she took up the cause of country-of-origin labeling that her late husband Sonny Bono had championed as a California congressman. The House vote on the Bono amendment was 296-121, thanks to a bipartisan group of consumer advocates, including most every woman in Congress. 

Florida Farmers, Inc. (FFI), an advocacy group of Florida winter vegetable growers, commended Senators Graham, Congresswoman Bono, Governor Jeb Bush and Florida Agriculture Commissioner Charles Bronson for their efforts in the last few days of the Farm Bill conference to keep country-of-origin labeling in the final Farm Bill report. FFI led a coalition of over 200 grassroots farm organizations, consumer and pubic interest groups across the nation to win this hard-fought issue. 

“The grassroots effort overcame the well-financed corporate food chain lobby to win the right to know and choose the place of origin of our food, “ said Paul DiMare of Homestead, Chairman of FFI.  “Country-of-origin labeling helps American consumers and those American farmers who provide food for American consumers.” 

“While much of the Farm Bill is oriented toward agribusiness sectors producing for export, Florida vegetable farmers are focused on providing a safe, quality product to the American consumer. In the present free trade environment, the national labeling law will help Florida winter vegetable farmers and all farmers of America compete with foreign products which may not meet the environmental and labor standards of U.S. growers,” according to J. Luis Rodriguez, a trade advisor to FFI who helped with the 1979 Florida effort and has advocated for national legislation for the past 20 years.

repository for the disposal of high-level radioactive waste and spent
nuclear fuel, pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982.  Approval in
the Senate would allow the Department of Energy to submit a license
application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Please forgive my direct approach and what may be interpreted as "sour grapes" email I sent to you and Waymond King, Marketing director for the Lottery, last night.
 
It is very difficult for me to have so much success in the Governmental Lottery market in other states (and countries) but not able to do business 2 miles down the road at the Florida Lottery.
 
The bravenet connection on the Florida Lottery website is packed full of illegal gambling sites.  That is a price the Lottery pays for using what is called a free service to conduct surveys and polls.  The Lottery added their own winning numbers email system through the FIRN network which is suppose to be an educational communication system.
 
The IMARCS system is used by several Lotteries, the Secretary of State, Associations, General Motors, Hotels and Resorts etc... and offers a suite of tools for direct marketing, forms processing, surveying, viral marketing, second chance to win systems, Lottery subscription services and more.
 
So, in closing, I am frustrated with my inability to close a deal with the Florida Lottery and that is my fault.  I am certain my email last night did not help my cause, but, I don't want to see this gambling site link exposed by someone else and it should go away quietly.  I have told the Lottery about this several times over the past year or so and have had no response.

Governor Bush, please select ADMIRAL TIM WRIGHT to serve an interim term on the Escambia Commission.  I have known him well since he arrived as Chief of Naval Education and Training, but more closely through our involvements with Starbase Atlantis (which he chaired), Chamber, Rotary, the Univ of West Florida, the outstanding Institute of Human and Machine Cognition, and many other social and civic functions.  We could not possibly have a more qualified professional leader who is willing to serve us in this challenging assignment.

Hi, Governor Bush. I'm Mike Grunwald; I'm a national reporter for The
Washington Post. I usually write long boring series about environmental
issues, and right now I'm working on one about Everglades restoration. I
was wondering if it would be possible to talk to you about it. I've spoken
to a bunch of your aides; David Struhs, Henry Dean, a slew of lower-ranking
people at the water district and other Florida agencies. But I'd love to
talk to you about your support for CERP, what you like about it, what (if
anything) concerns you about it, how (if at all) having two brothers in
charge of it matters, what you think about the criticism from enviros and
some federal people that the state has fought to avoid specific guarantees
for the environment, etc. I'd also like to ask you a bit about growth
management in Florida, especially in Southwest Florida, where it seems like
some of the same mistakes that led to CERP are being made all over again.
(I talked to Mel Martinez about this here in DC...)

Anyway, I know you're busy, and I'm not sure you read these e-mails
yourself. But if you get a few minutes, I'm at 202-334-7440. Or you can
e-mail me...whatever works.

Thanks so much.

Best,

Mike

The other issue is that we are working to replace the union as our collective bargaining unit.  Because the union is a political organization that supports issues I can't, I've never been a member.  Hopefully, the new bargaining unit will be a non-political group made up of teachers representing each school.

4,300 school workers overpaid
Audit: Errors cost $2.1 million
BY SONJI JACOBS
sajacobs@herald.com

More than 4,300 Broward school employees -- including dozens who no longer
work for the district -- were overpaid a total of $2.1 million since July 1
because of persistent problems with a new payroll system, according to an
audit obtained by The Herald.

The problems also have left public school officials uncertain about how much
money remains in the district's coffers and may prevent them from completing
financial reports required by state and federal laws.

District officials say they are working on a plan to recover the money,
though some workers have stepped forward and admitted they were overpaid.
The plan would deduct the overpayments from paychecks and will be presented
to school board members later this month, officials said.

''Depending on the amount of overpayment, we're going to work on a payment
plan,'' said Schools Superintendent Frank Till. ``Employees don't have a
choice. We just have to be able to document the overpayment amount is
correct.''

The district has been plagued by a rash of problems since it began using the
$18 million computer payroll system on July 1.

Some employees were paid late, others weren't paid at all.

The April 4 Ernst & Young audit blames the $2.1 million in overpayments on
gaps between the actual dates of terminations, retirements and disabilities
and the time the information was logged in the computer system.

It also says many payroll and human resource personnel weren't properly
trained.

Patrick Reilly, the district's audit chief, said some of the overpayment
problems were more the result of human error than the new payroll system.

''Some employees who left the system weren't taken off payroll in a timely
way,'' Reilly said. ``That's a data entry problem, not necessarily a
software problem.''

While district officials are trying to resolve problems, the payroll
department estimates it will take about 90 minutes to explain the
overpayments and repayment schedules to each employee -- a total of 6,450
hours. The audit doesn't specify how much each employee was overpaid.

''If notices were sent to all affected employees,'' the district's response
and action plan states, ``we would be flooded with an unimaginable number of
phone calls and requests for appointments with employees to settle their
accounts.''

The memo goes on to state, ``It was suggested it might be more cost
effective to write off overpayments less than a certain amount.''

The audit also found the district has been unable to balance its key
accounts on a monthly basis for the last 10 months.

As a result, officials don't know how much money remains in the $1.4 billion
annual operating budget.

Without the reports, the district may miss deadlines for required financial
statements, according to the audit. The Annual Financial Report, for
example, is due to the Florida Department of Education in early September.
Tardy school districts can be sanctioned by the state, but DOE officials
often work with struggling districts to help them get their financial
reporting in, said Adam Shores, a state education department spokesman.

Without key accounting reports such as payroll register and labor
distribution, the district can't plan its payroll for the next fiscal year.

Those reports also help district officials generate crucial grant reports
for programs such as Title I, a federal program that pumps about $29 million
per year into the county's poorest schools. More than 52,000 Broward
students attend 83 schools that receive Title I dollars.

The district's payroll system has been mired in problems including late and
inaccurate paychecks since its implementation in July. Dozens of school bus
drivers staged a wildcat strike in November after they kept getting late
paychecks.

Teachers and other school district employees also complained about their
paystubs late last year. About 100 teachers staged a December protest at the
school district's main administrative building in Fort Lauderdale over the
problems.

John Ristow, Broward Teachers Union spokesman, said a few teachers are still
receiving late paychecks, but many more are having problems with
overpayments and automatic deductions. He said teachers still experiencing
problems are mostly new hires and those returning from leaves of absence.

''District staff does not seem very motivated to resolve these issues,''
Ristow said.

The audit report lists several ''lessons learned:'' Allowing adequate time
to transition to future new computer systems and making sure employees
understand them before the systems are put in place.

School Board member Lois Wexler said she was ''very upset'' about the
payroll problems. She said staff told her the district overpaid employees
between $300 and $400,000 during the 2000-01 school year before the new
payroll system was put in place.

''Now, in less than one year, it's over $2 million and that's definitely a
cause for alarm,'' Wexler said. ``Sometimes when the money is gone, it's
gone. I hope that's not the case here.''

Dear Governor Bush:

It is with great pleasure and without reservation that I write this letter 
recommending you appoint Judge Allen Register to the position of Circuit 
Judge in the 14th Judicial Circuit.  I have had the pleasure of practicing 
under Judge Register as an prosecuting attorney assigned to County Court, 
Washington County since August of 2000.

I have found Judge Register to be intelligent, experienced, and well 
grounded.  Judge Register makes a conscientious effort to ensure that all 
parties are able to have their say in court.  He takes great pain to ensure 
that he understands the arguments, both legal and factual, in the cases that 
come before him.  Further, when issuing the opinion of the Court, Judge 
Register  is not afraid to take a stand and tell people why he is ruling the 
way he is ruling, even when it is not in their favor.

In conclusion, It is my sincere desire that you will give Judge Register 
your earnest consideration as a candidate for Circuit Judge.  Judge Register 
embodies the conservative ideology of those of us here Northwest Florida, 
and I feel if appointed he would be an asset to both you and the people of 
the 14th Judicial Circuit.

Very Truly Yours,
Rusty Shepard

Hello again, Jeb!
 
OK, here it is…The following content is still in the current Nanny Bill. As long as these parts are still there, I still adamantly oppose the Nanny Bill.
 
Can you please answer each of the questions below, and respond to the last reason regarding the costs of the program, and guarantee your answers?
 
 
1) S.B. 1844 mandates automatic referrals of high-risk newborns to the local Learning Gateway through the Office of Vital Statistics.
Who determines what is considered high risk? There is no parental consent required for this referral. What happens if the parent chooses not to follow up on this referral?
 
2) S.B. 1844 directs that screening processes be developed and tested to address social/emotional/behavioral indicators which could be a sign of future problems.
Will the Florida Department of Children and Families take the child away if the parent chooses to follow his own doctor's advice instead of the government's?
 
3) S.B. 1844 requires that an electronic data system be developed to track children who are screened, assessed, and referred for services.
Will mom and dad be able to remove the child from the government programs if the initial screening is done without parent's consent?
 
4) S.B. 1844 creates a huge, expensive bureaucracy, with the intent of expanding the program statewide.
The pilot project is $6 million the first year for only three counties---what will it cost taxpayers to fund this program for the whole state?
 
Thanks Jeb!

Dear Jeb,
 
With all due respect, I have twice now stated my reasons why I still strongly oppose the Nanny Bill. So, I now ask for you to tell me what specific parts you think have changed and why you support the parts that are left. 
 
I also welcome your thoughts regarding the nightmare with Social Services that happened to my neighbor friend, as mentioned in my previous emails.
 
Can you tell me where I can find your veto message so that I can read it as you requested? It won’t change my opinion or requests for you to veto the Nanny Bill again, as what is left of it is still unacceptable, but I’d at least like to read it.
 
Vetoing the current bill is the only answer for Florida families. The technology initiative bill can be resubmitted at another time, without the Nanny Bill sneakily attached.

Hi Jeb!
 
I have not received a response from you regarding my last email concerning the Nanny Bill. I am resending my last email here in case you did not receive it the first time. I reiterate my very strong opposition to this bill. The bill is largely unchanged and will still greatly increase the power of the government over children at the expense of parents' rights…UNACCEPTABLE.
 
I know that you believe in parental rights and the rights and strengths of families…that is what has made this country as wonderful as it has become. I’ve relayed my friend’s story to you regarding abuse by the current Social Services Agency here in Orlando and how it overwhelmingly confirms so very much my opposition to even more interference and abuse by the government.
 
The recent stories in the news, regarding missing children in Florida under Social Services’ care, is even greater evidence of how the establishment has degraded and has become dysfunctional for the most part. Over 300 children are missing!! We were in disbelief and quite disappointed that you supported Social Services in a statement you made at Daytona International Speedway last week while at another speaking engagement. We thought that news would have helped you to see what is already wrong with Social Services and how new similar government agencies will cause even more harm to Florida families. YES, there are situations where children need help, but too often the “help” is unjustified and only bogs down and further perverts the operations of the system.
 
What is truly upsetting is the apparent deceptiveness and possible deal-making that has occurred to get this bill to your desk. This is WRONG…I don’t care how long these things have been going on it doesn’t make them right.
 
Jeb, I’m still praying for God to help you make the right decision here, the best decision for ALL Florida residents. If my husband and I were considering having more children, the passing of this bill would be cause enough to definitely choose not to have any more and that’s a horrible choice to have to make. Please veto the bill…the bill the Nanny Bill was attached to can be resubmitted later without the Nanny Bill tacked on…you know they’ll try again.
 
THANKS Jeb! Look forward to hearing from you again. :-)

Hi Jeb!
 
Thanks for responding. I realize that the technology initiative bill that the Nanny Bill was attached to is good but the Nanny Bill needs to be detached from it before you sign it. I still stand by my firm belief that the current Nanny Bill will open up a whole new can of worms with regards to invasion of families’ privacy. Families have been doing just fine for thousands of years and this bill is completely intrusive and unnecessary, including a major drain on our tax dollars and we’re pretty fed up already that a third of our income is already going to many government agencies that we don’t care for and feel are unnecessary and where abuse is already occurring.
 
There are too many questions regarding the content of the current Nanny Bill:
 
1) S.B. 1844 mandates automatic referrals of high-risk newborns to
the local Learning Gateway through the Office of Vital Statistics.
Who determines what is considered high risk? There is no parental
consent required for this referral. What happens if the parent
chooses not to follow up on this referral?
 
2) S.B. 1844 directs that screening processes be developed and tested
to address social/emotional/behavioral indicators which could be a
sign of future problems. Will the Florida Department of Children and
Families take the child away if the parent chooses to follow his own
doctor's advice instead of the government's?
 
3) S.B. 1844 requires that an electronic data system be developed to
track children who are screened, assessed, and referred for services.
Will mom and dad be able to remove the child from the government
programs if the initial screening is done without parent's consent?
 
4) S.B. 1844 creates a huge, expensive bureaucracy, with the intent
of expanding the program statewide. The pilot project is $6 million
the first year for only three counties---what will it cost taxpayers
to fund this program for the whole state?
 
 
This really hits close to home with me, Jeb. I was just informed that one of my neighbors, also a friend, was falsely turned in to Social Services very recently and it has really messed with her head. It was one of our other neighbors, whose children play with my friend's kids, that called in the report. Because of the severity of the false accusations, a Social Services worker responded to the call within an hour and showed up at her house. He required her to "pee in a cup" because she was falsely accused of smoking marijuana. She was so humiliated. Unbeknownst to my friend, the same social worker ("a big black man" according to her kids) then went to her kids' school and interviewed and strip searched all three of her kids (the oldest is 9 or 10 years of age). THIS IS A NIGHTMARE FOR FAMILIES!!!
 
This is the closest I've come to knowing someone who's been through this and it really ticks me off that false accusations can be used to torment a decent family!! Her case is still open, pending a reverse investigation into the family who made the accusations. I told her to give my name as a character reference if needed...I feel so badly for her and her family! GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO GET MUCH MORE INFORMATION BEFORE JUMPING TO STRIP SEARCHING CHILDREN AND MAKING PARENTS GIVE URINE SAMPLES!!!! This kind of business has a demoralizing impact on innocent children and their families!
 
I hope you now understand why I and so many others will continue to oppose this horrible legislation. I’m adamant about it enough that you’ll probably lose my vote in the upcoming election if you sign that Nanny Bill into law. It’s just too wide open for too many frightening repercussions to families who choose not to have the agency’s involvement.
 
I’ve supported you 100%+ and helped vote you into office, mainly because of your strong family values, which is what has made this country what it is today…the land of the free. I hope I will be able to do that again next election. I ask God to help you make the best decision for Florida families.
 
THANKS, Jeb! God Bless!

Lisa, thank you for writing. The learning gateway bill is much, much different than the previous bill that i vetoed. Unfortunately, it is attached to one of our highest priorities, the technology initiative bill that will help accelerate high wage jobs for the future.
 
I ask that you look at the new version and tell me what part of it you disagree with.

Subject: Government Nanny Bill
Dear Governor Bush,
 
My family and I have been following the Government Nanny Bill and have just learned that Senate Majority leader John McKay slipped his Government Nanny Bill (formerly S.B. 88) into S.B. 1844 and that both the Senate and the House passed it today, not realizing that the Nanny Bill had been attached to S.B. 1844 at the last minute. Talk about DECEPTION!!! Apparently, Senator McKay will do anything to achieve his agenda and will stoop as low as possible in his efforts to deceive to make it happen. This man, and anyone like him, should be immediately removed from holding any public office where he represents American people!!
 
Here's what we know about the situation:
 
S.B. 1844 is now the vehicle to create a new government
program called Learning Gateway and will involve "developing
strategies for offering hospital visits or home visits by trained
staff to new mothers."
 
The purpose of Learning Gateway is to screen children from birth to
age 9 for "biological, environmental, and behavioral risks," and
"learning problems." Furthermore, Learning Gateway providers will
conduct "intake with families," conduct "needs/strength-based
assessments of families," and "make referrals for needed services"
and "developmental monitoring."
 
This will all be done in collaboration with the Florida Department of
Children and Family Services and numerous other big government
agencies and programs.
 
Some additional reasons why we oppose S.B. 1844:
 
1) S.B. 1844 mandates automatic referrals of high-risk newborns to
the local Learning Gateway through the Office of Vital Statistics.
Who determines what is considered high risk? There is no parental
consent required for this referral. What happens if the parent
chooses not to follow up on this referral?
 
2) S.B. 1844 directs that screening processes be developed and tested
to address social/emotional/behavioral indicators which could be a
sign of future problems. Will the Florida Department of Children and
Families take the child away if the parent chooses to follow his own
doctor's advice instead of the government's?
 
3) S.B. 1844 requires that an electronic data system be developed to
track children who are screened, assessed, and referred for services.
Will mom and dad be able to remove the child from the government
programs if the initial screening is done without parent's consent?
 
4) S.B. 1844 creates a huge, expensive bureaucracy, with the intent
of expanding the program statewide. The pilot project is $6 million
the first year for only three counties---what will it cost taxpayers
to fund this program for the whole state?
 
Governor Bush, PLEASE DO NOT SIGN THIS BILL!!! Please tell Senator John McKay to stop trampling on parental rights with intrusive, dangerous legislation that is completely anti-family in nature and opens the door for a wide range of government abuses, as well as being a major drain on taxpayers’ money. American people will NOT stand for this!!!!
 
Thanks Jeb…I hope you and your family are doing very well. And thanks for all you do for Florida residents!

This is a term we use when one of ours does a good job. (Of course, I never get them as you certainly understand).

You did a really nice job Monday at the Law Enforcement Memorial and again today at the ceremony for the fallen "SEAL".

I gave Scott Maddox a ride to Sheriff Harveys cookout Monday after leaving the Capitol. Patted him on the head, etc. for making the nice remarks about you. Will try to keep them coming but the little fellow sometimes just runs amok.

FYI Sheriff Harvey was in TMH from Friday till today for some type off chest pains. They found nothing wrong with his heart and are supposedly sending him home today. He committed to me that he's supporting you. Endorsement publically doesn't look real good due to number of State Employees in his county.

Hope you took no offense at my wise crack about your tie. It really went fine with your outfit.

Democratic Presidential contenders showed up at the Florida Democratic Party 
meeting and that, surprise, surprise, video of the speeches were available 
afterward.  I also don't think that it is a coincidence that with all that 
is going on in this country and the world, that the national media focus is 
on Florida foster care.

I am not making light of the plight of foster children, as my mother was 
one, but you need to get the facts out in front of these folks before the 
national media indicts you for one of Ponce De Leon's cabin boys being 
missing for over 500 years.........Rick

Notwithstanding the fact that Jeff Minder is CEO of Imarcs and that we

anything else contained in his e-mail. The parts of his document that

not gross distortions of facts are fabricated out of thin air. We did
however find an issue with a Bravenet link that took us to a gambling

we have pulled our survey pending resolution. We have never had a

Hi Waymond,
 
So, here is the outline I will be presenting to anyone who will listen:
 
1.  I tried to talk the Fl Lottery into using the Internet to increase
their sales.
2.  I am a CEO of a Tallahassee based company who is dedicated to the
growth of this region and this state and who has 6 other Lotteries as
clients
3.  I presented new ideas (patent pending) to the Lottery through demos
with you and David for the past 2 years
4.  You stalled me based on legal issues you said you had and I worked
with Ken hart, at your direction, to solve these issues
5.  you deployed a solution on your own (good for you if it is good for
the Lottery and the state and as long as it does not infringe on my
patents and as long as it is legal)
 
I have invested time, money, and energy into this solution (IMARCS) and
I took the time to educate you and your staff and in return you bypass
me.  I understand this approach and actually respect it...it creates
competition.  Up till now...however, I have supported you and David
consistently, that is over and we are now playing on a different field.
I went to your site today at www.fllottery.com , clicked on the bravenet
link (your survey and polling system) and was taken to an illegal
gambling site...endorsed, obviously, by the Florida Lottery since you
have it on your site. (the link actually exposes me, the lottery
consumer, to over 100 illegal gambling sites)
 
I want to be perfectly clear.  For close to a year I have told you that

Dear Governor Bush: 

Hi!  This is Shayna Hart again.  I wrote you an e-mail last Friday and my Mom and I just realized you couldn't e-mail me back if you tried because we had a block on my e-mail so I couldn't get any bad e-mail.  You can e-mail me now if you want because you are on the list of people who can.   I'm really sorry about that!   

I'm attaching a copy of my last e-mail just in case you forgot what it said.  I hope I hear from you, or my teacher Mrs. Meddock does!  Thank you!

Dear Governor Bush: 

My school is dedicating a memorial garden for the victims of September 11 on Friday, May 10, 2001, at 8:30 a.m.  I got to thinking and I thought it would be nice if I invited you to come.  Our art teacher, Mrs. Boni Meddock, designed it and the students and teachers participated in the making of it.  Each of us put a piece of glass into an American flag mosaic and our fifth graders made stepping stone mosaics.  Some students even competed by writing an essay or four verse poem about September 11, why we're proud of our country, or we could make up our own topic about the USA.  The winners, one person from each classroom, (I won for my class!) got to plant something in the memorial garden.  We also get to be at the dedication ceremony!  We're even trying to get people from television stations  to come too! 

I think that my school would appreciate it if you and Mrs. Bush could come.  I know this is short notice, but I thought I would invite you anyway.  If you need to reach Mrs. Meddock, her e-mail address is bmeddock@mail.volusia.k12.fl.us. Thanks for your time Governor Bush! Good luck in the election! 

Sincerely, 

Shayna Hart

I will respond on behalf of DOH but I need a few days to confer. 
No one is to authorize unless I say so. 

Please answer these questions for me. 
Am I correct in my assumption that that the building is currently under a formal indefinite public health quarantine? 
Was the quarantine signed by Jean Malecki? Did we seek a court order or did we use quarantine powers delegated by me? 
This study could potentially give us all valuable public health knowledge for the future? 
Can DOH be formally involved in the study and credited in some way(e.g. our labs, epi, environmental health etc.)? 
Is there a long term plan to clean and reoccupy? 
Who owns the building? 

Thank you for keeping me in the loop.

Briefing Document v 1.1

Summary Description: Proposed Study of Anthrax Spore Dispersion 
 in the Indoor Environment of the AMI Building in Florida 
RATIONALE 
        Environmental sampling during the public health response to the 
anthrax attacks of 2001 was done principally with the aim of ascertaining 
the presence or absence of anthrax contamination.  Accordingly, samples were 
taken only where the suspicion of contamination was the highest. 
Laboratories analyzing these samples generally reported results as either 
positive or negative, indicating the presence or absence of anthrax but not 
the numbers of spores or colony forming units (CFU). 
        It is now clear that surface contamination persists in affected 
facilities and that resuspension of anthrax spores can occur, posing a 
potentially lethal health risk.  However, quantifying this risk is 
problematic, in part because of the very few quantitative data we have on 
anthrax contamination and the lack of systematic, representative sampling in 
contaminated facilities.  
        The study we propose is an important initial step to better 
characterize how the weaponized anthrax spores dispersed and became 
distributed in the environment. 

METHODS 
        We propose to travel a team of 40-hour Hazwopper-trained ATSDR, 
NIOSH, NCEH, NCID, and FBI staff to AMI during June 7-18, 2002. 
Investigators will enter the building first to get baseline air samples in 
the heavily contaminated mail room and the less contaminated photo library. 
Then surfaces will be sampled according to a pre-determined pattern and 
using a uniform technique.  (The exact method will be chosen based on 
sampling method sensitivity studies currently underway in the NCID 
microbiology laboratories.)  The samples will be quantified in the 
laboratory in terms of spores per square cm of surface.  Both floors and 
elevated surfaces (shelves & tabletops) will be sampled.  Deviation from a 
precise absolutely regular grid may occur in the hallways, where we expect 
foot traffic to have had a heavy influence on spore concentrations.  In 
areas where nearby samples show highly disparate values, a second stage of 
samples may be taken, involving a second series of  building entries during 
the study period.  In addition, air sampling will continue during the 
surface sampling activity, in order to detect any resuspension of spores 
that our activity generates.  
        We are currently securing permission for this activity.  Agencies 
contacted so far who are involved with the site have expressed agreement in 
principle, pending review of an expanded protocol 

ANTICIPATED FINDINGS 
*       Accurate graphical representation of interpolated spore 
concentrations 
*       Rate(s) of fall-off in spore concentrations as one travels away from 
heavy contamination 
*       An approximate representation of how corridor foot traffic affected 
spore distribution 
*       Approximate extent of surface contamination by the airborne route 
*       Estimate of airborne spore exposures resulting from disturbing 
settled spores 
*       Findings will also serve as an important point of comparison for 
further studies of airborne spread, which will likely use simulants 
(simulated spores). 

CONCLUSION 
        In combination with laboratory studies estimating the probability of 
illness with various doses of spores, this study and others like it will 
help estimate the likelihood of significant human exposure from residual 
surface spores following a primary anthrax contamination event.

Subject:	Private Public Partnership vs Traditional Methods

Frank. I enjoyed our visit last week. It was informative and I was 
encouraged. Going forward, it might helpful to the process of getting to the 
end game, if you might cite the specific authority/statute/rule for the 
private-public partnership engagement. Specifically I would like you to, in 
this context and for the purpose of the end game, dialogue with Matt Carter.

I don't know if you have or recall whether you have met Mr.. Carter, Esq.: 
Matt is presently the Executive Director of the State House Council on 
Competitive Commerce which oversees five rather significant committees in 
the Florida State House of Representatives. Prior to this appointment, he 
was Deputy Secretary at Florida Department of Management Services, where he 
extremely and damn well served the Governor in coordinating organizing and 
delivering great results in minority and small business contracting 
development and outreach. You can look at the numbers and do the math, and 
with the Governor's support, Mr.. Carter achieved a lot during his DMS 
tenure.

In that regard Matt may be very helpful in helping to craft an appropriate 
private-public partnership construct regarding Broker's International Group, 
LLC and the South Florida Water Management District, in order to facilitate 
greater participation of minority contractors, per One Florida, at the 
district, which is an ancillary, yet important, part of the overall plan to 
save the district 1 & 1/2 % to 3% saving in your O&M costs as we discussed.

Certainly would like to determine if this partnership approach can be as 
efficient in getting to the end game as would be a more traditional process. 
With Regards
Romerio Perkins

90-year-old man earns GED 
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) _ Harry Patrinelli feared if he didn't keep his mind sharp, he would end up in a rocking chair, one step from the grave. 
So the 90-year-old man went back to school to earn his GED and participated in a graduation ceremony Tuesday night at Daytona Beach Community College. 
Patrinelli actually graduated from high school back in 1930 in Massachusetts, and went to college to become an industrial engineer. He worked for a plastics factory that made pink flamingo yard decorations. 
But Patrinelli lost his diploma when he retired to Florida in 1974 and thought the $100 replacement fee was too expensive. He decided to go for a GED in 2000 because he needed a diploma to take a real estate course. 
Patrinelli took the classes for eight months, alongside classmates young enough to be his great-grandchildren. 
``It was crazy at first because some of the kids were out of this world, really,'' said Patrinelli, who complained that some students slept in class. 
He passed the test on his first attempt, almost a year ago. 
Patrinelli recently finished the real estate course, too, but has yet to pass the licensing exam. He was sidelined for a couple of months this spring after being injured in a car accident.

Jeb......FYI

Since retiring from Shands as their lobbyist, I'm with an entreprenueal 
businss named 3 Sigma (affiliated with the 51 yr. old May Companies).  Based 
in Gainesville, we provide private and govt. guranteed financing for overseas 
agricultural shipments.  When the ag. shipment is FOB the Fla. or U.S. port, 
our bank(s) cut a check and prepay the ag. producer.      We're focusing 
mainly on Florida agriculture.  Charlie Bronson and his people, and Bob 
Crawford, have been very helpful as we, in turn, can help producers.   

Also, we have two unique technology projects we're helping get started via 
private venture capital and Congressional  R & D appropriations funding (via 
DoD).  Bill Young and his people, and other Members of the Fla. Cong. 
Delegation being  very nonpartisan in their support.  

NorthrupGrumman coming next week to meet with us re: a sensing device which 
makes distinctions within and between naturally occuring radiation.  And can 
do so from a remote location, including thru a wall.  The other project is a 
blood based diagnostic bio marker for Traumatic Brain Injury.  A UF Brain 
Institute scientist is the inventor.  We're helping him set up a spin off, 
tech transfer company named Daimonion Diagnostics. 

Exciting science, good for Florida and the nation, and may prove to be 
financially rewarding.  Think your technology initiatives would be interested 
?  I only know Erik Kirk @ My Florida (in my younger days, I was a Claude 
Kirk staffer and speech writer).

Dear Governor Bush,
            I trust you are keeping busy and making us proud to live in
Florida.  Don't forget about the poor teachers up here in the Panhandle.
Lawmakers seem to forget that we are apart of Florida.  We missed you on
Friday, March 1st, for "Read Across America Day".  I doubt that you ever
got the invitation but you were invited, AGAIN, (3 years in a row) to
read to our wonderful First Graders.  Remember-a good person learns HOW
to count but a great person learns WHAT counts.  I hope you can remember
to pay attention to what is really important in life.
                                                Thanks,

Well if you liked that you will love this--look at the Brevard Federation of Teachers "The Brevard Teacher" Flyer.  I had to leave the teachers lounge this morning--they say you are spinning--note the absence of 9/11 altogether--like it never happened and has nothing to do with anything.  The May 7th issue doesn't seem to be online yet.  It starts off with a chart and says there is 1.37% increase--or $69 per student.  Most teachers are believing every word without question too!

there is an appeal to counter your teachers of the year ads with letters to the editor with a suggested paragraph which end with how FCAT has harmed teaching :-(  the latter particularly bothers me when in fact the students individual FCAT results with specific data on deficient standards the teacher can then use to target for each students learning.  GW said it best yesterday--don't know where he was--but he said that he knows students don't like taking tests but...."too bad"!  So what is the teachers union saying?  We don't want to know what the students don't know?  argghhh

Schools spurn budget increase

$1.1 billion for education insufficient, DiPatri says

By Zenaida A. Gonzalez
FLORIDA TODAY

SATELLITE BEACH -- Brevard Public Schools Superintendent Richard DiPatri
and
14 other superintendents throughout Florida held simultaneous news
conferences Wednesday to say the $1.1 billion education budget state
legislators are expected to approve Friday, isn't nearly enough.

"We want to make it clear," DiPatri said. "This is not an attack on the
governor or legislators. . . . We're just trying to inform our community
so
they know that when they read the newspaper and see a 9.1 percent
increase
in the budget, it's really not a 9.1 percent. It's a 1.7 percent
increase."
Student growth, the reinstatement of budget cuts made this year and the
cost
of health care and insurance eat up most of the $1 billion, leaving$201
million to be divided among 67 districts, DiPatri said. That is about
1.7
percent.
Rep. Bob Allen, R-Merritt Island, disagreed and was irritated by the
school
district conferences.
"I get a little fed up with school boards meeting after every increase
and
saying it's not enough," Allen said. "They need to make the point to
their
constituents, we are giving the max we can get out of this budget,
unless
the citizens of Florida want us to raise taxes or stop delivering care
to
the poor and needy."
Allen also criticized Brevard for its climbing health care costs.
"That was a management decision. . . . It might have been a good choice
for
some health needs, but it costs more money."
The district and others in the care costs, which all districts have been
facing over the past three years. Private industry is facing a similar
climb.
Laurie Davie, a parent of students at Surfside Elementary School and
DeLaura
Middle School in Satellite Beach, said she was disappointed schools
would be
short-changed again.
"Health care is costing more everywhere, and if districts are expected
to
provide it, the state should give us an adequate amount to cover that
expense in addition to money for the classroom," Davie said.
Maggie Roller, a parent of a sixth-grader at Surfside, said she was
frustrated.
"I keep hearing (governor) Jeb on television saying that education is
our
No. 1 priority," Roller said. "I'd like to see him put the money where
his
mouth is."
She also took a shot at legislators.
"I understand what they're doing in Tallahassee," Roller said. "They
want to
get re-elected, and they aren't going to be elected if they raise
taxes."
DiPatri said it was unlikely that the legislators would change their
minds
at this point but wanted to let parents know that if no more money is
set
aside for education, the district could be laying off 50 teachers and
increasing class sizes. There's also a possibility other programs from
athletics to the arts could be reduced or eliminated.
Sally Davis, a teacher at Surfside, said she was worried.
"It's scary," Davis said. "Class size is really important to me because
it
impacts my daily work. The smaller the class size, the better I am able
to
get to each student and ensure they are learning what they need to know
to
succeed."

Subject: Proposed Changes to Redevelopment F.S. 163

May 9, 2002

Dear Governor Bush,

There is a bill awaiting your signature that I ask you,
quite simply, not to sign. I don’t know what the actual
bill number is but it makes sweeping changes to F.S.
Chapter 163, which deals with redevelopment and the
standards for a government finding of blight, the first
step in establishing the use of eminent domain to take an
individual’s private property. 

Government should do nothing that eases its ability to
invoke eminent domain…yet that is exactly what the
Legislature has done by removing a standard from the
existing legislation. With this new bill before you no
longer must an area be legally considered as being a menace
to public health, safety, morals or welfare in its present
condition or use. That criterion has been dropped for much
looser standards having to do with government statistics.
As I recall from both my undergrad and graduate college
statistic courses, depending upon how one frames the
question, statistics can be made to support just about
anything. Certainly such a fluid standard is less than
adequate when applied to private property rights.

It’s bad enough that there has been absolutely no oversight
or accountability for the 100+ redevelopment areas
throughout the state. It’s bad enough that under the
current law, the entire city of New Port Richey was
declared blighted, including the very wealthy waterfront
neighborhoods.

It’s bad enough that the existing statute doesn’t specify
certain established criteria, i.e. blight as an area in
which a substantial number of slum or deteriorating
structures exist. Minus any legal standard in F.S. 163 for
the term “substantial” the city of Daytona Beach, just last
summer, declared an area blighted claiming only 14% of the
structures substandard met the definition of “substantial”.
The dictionary defines substantial as being of considerable
size or amount, very large, a great deal. 14% means 86% was
standard, good or excellent. It’s obvious which of those
numbers better fits the dictionary definition, yet our
current law allowed this. The proposed revision before you
is even more flexible. Because of the vagueness of the
current law, 61 homeowners are now subject to eminent
domain for any project the city deems worthy, whether it’s
a parking lot for a motel, a Walgreen’s or a Publix. Would
you want to lose your home to a project like that?
Shouldn’t state government’s use of taking one’s property
reflect the U.S. Constitution’s – that of taking for a
public purpose? 

The Illinois Supreme Court recently struck down a local
authority’s taking of a recycling plant’s property to add
on to a racetrack’s parking lot. The court said the use of
eminent domain in economic development cases should be
closely scrutinized, “that using the power of government
for purely private purposes to allow one property owner to
avoid the open real-estate market, thus maximizing
corporate profits, is a misuse of the power entrusted by
the public.” Even Florida statute recognizes that the value
of a property is arrived at only when there is an exchange
between a willing buyer and a willing seller. Any “duress”
in the exchange devalues the property. And “negotiating”
under the threat of eminent domain definitely qualifies
as”duress” under the law.
    
Given that a person’s home is the largest single investment
for the greatest majority of our population, for government
to deny the individual the right to realize the most from
their investment is reprehensible. Yet our Republican
legislature has done just that.

And that is the worst part of the proposed changes in the
redevelopment statute. It is the Republican Florida
Legislature has done this! One of my basic understandings
of my own party is its stance on private property rights.
Rights that have been abused through several pieces of
Federal legislation, extreme environmental readings of the
law coming first to mind. Yet the Republican legislature
has passed a bill that deeply undercuts an individual’s
right to their own property by easing the restrictions
against government’s ability to take it.

Additionally, the legislature has done this in the face of
courts all across this country sending a strong message
concerning the clash of eminent domain and private property
that government has gone too far. Why? Because local
governments nationwide are using eminent domain, not to
take a person’s property for public use but for private
use. Local governments have become the tool for private
developers to avoid the open real estate market in
acquiring property for purely private, economic purposes.
In effect, local governments are picking and choosing
economic winners and losers. It’s not about economic
development. It’s about whose economic development and the
smaller property owner is losing out to the larger,
corporate property owner. Or the property owner with the
most expensive lobbyist.

I realize I am not part of any organized group, like
motorcyclists. Nor am I part of any business lobbying
effort, like billboard owners. But, considering your record
in these two areas, surely a person’s right to his/her
property counts as greatly as the motorcyclist’s right to
ride helmetless or the billboard owner’s right to realize
the value of his/her business investment.

I realize I am not a developer, the big business interests
that Republicans are always accused of being biased
towards. But I thought our concern was for a fair playing
field, with minimal government interference, allowing
business to thrive; not for setting up the field in such a
way that big business can actually steal from the small
businessperson. That’s what the changes to F.S. Chapter 163
will do. Rather than level the playing field these changes
will bulldoze the small property owner right off the field.

Think about it. One of the criteria for blighted conditions
currently, is a “diversity of ownership” in the defined
area. I think “diversity of ownership” is also known as
realizing a major part of the American Dream... that of a
person owning his/her own home. Did you know that a greater
percentage of people own their homes in America than in any
other country in the world! Did you know that Florida law
requires a 12-person jury for only two kinds of trail?
Murder and eminent domain. That of taking a person’s life
or taking a person’s property.

I told you what I was not. What I have been is an elected
municipal. I have voted to establish a redevelopment area
based on a survey showing the proposed area as having 48%
of its structures deteriorating, the highest crime stats in
the city, lack of curbs and sidewalks in the majority of
the area as well as substandard lot sizes given current
drainage, stormwater and setback criteria. I have voted to
invoke eminent domain against a holdout property owner for
a public parking garage and public areas along the beach.
These were not easy decisions, as I had 

concerns then over the current vagueness in the statutes.
But, compared to the greater picture, the situations were
extreme enough to warrant my support. I cannot imagine
decreasing those standards even more.

What I am is one small voice. A single citizen. And I am
begging you not to sign this bill. Please.

I recall several times when, after hearing public comment
on an issue, it would be the words of a single citizen that
made more sense than staff, consultants, experts and
professionals. Why? Because the single citizen, oftentimes,
was closer to feeling the possible effect of a proposed law
than everyone else involved in making that law. I pray that
is the case here. 

Thank you.

I am sending this brief email to express my complete and unqualified support

government and she has proven herself to be unifying force for the good of

completely.  Her ethical standards are above reproach.

Governor, I truly believe Marie Young would be your best choice of all those

whom you appoint.

God bless you.

Where do we start? 1980s during the Ericks era, Joe Robinson, Jim Billie 
Barnes, Tom Perry, Jimmy Holderfield, all former F.S.L. President's 
committed to legislation, through today 2002.  What a 20 plus year 
effort. 

How about the years of Legislative effort?  Robb Robertson, Ron 
Bartholome, Tim Ingold, Bob Voss, Armando Aguilar, Dave Stevens, Al 
Cotera, David Scott, Carl Smith, James Mann, John Connolly and the 
SCORES of our members who have placed legislation on their agenda and 
SERVED THEIR TIME in Tallahassee during the legislative session these 
past several years making Legislation  a priority. 

How about the effort and influence of 22,000 members of the Florida 
State F.O.P. who have participated in the effort and funded the cost 
through our annual dues money. 

What about a Governor who has kept every single promise made to the 
F.O.P. over his tenure as Governor.  THANKS GOVERNOR BUSH. 

What about the folks at Erick's Consultants?  Thanks Lisa, Dave, Candice 
and everyone else there that helped.

 GRANTS AWARDED FOR FLORIDA SPACE RESEARCH/EDUCATION PROJECTS

         CAPE CANAVERAL SPACEPORT (May 9, 2002) -- The NASA-sponsored Florida Space Grant Consortium (FSGC) at the University of Central Florida, and the Florida Space Research Institute (FSRI) today announced the selection of sixteen space research and education projects to receive over $360,000 in grant awards.  The grants will combine federal and state funds for projects supporting space-related commercial, military and NASA priorities in Florida.  

        “Our efforts to expand Florida’s academic involvement in space research and technology development are bearing fruit with the recent announcement of major new centers supported by NASA and the National Science Foundation,” said Florida Lt. Governor Frank Brogan.  “This latest round of state grant awards will add to the momentum we have established in Florida, and promote our vision for a statewide, multi-disciplinary aerospace research and education program.”  

        The approved research and education projects will involve 10 different universities and colleges, including Brevard Community College; Embry Riddle Aeronautical University; Florida A&M University; Florida Gulf Coast University; Florida Institute of Technology; Florida State University; Nova Southeastern University; University of Central Florida; University of Florida; and the University of Miami.  Other recipients include the Astronauts Memorial Foundation and the Hubbs Sea World Research Institute.  The projects cover a variety of topics, including spaceport technologies, satellite remote sensing, aerospace education and workforce training, and launch vehicle propulsion systems.  

        Also funded by FSGC under the same joint solicitation were eleven summer research projects for undergraduate students.  Through this program, students from the Florida Institute of Technology, Florida State University, University of Central Florida, and the University of Florida will each receive $3,000 to conduct space-related research projects in cooperation with faculty mentors.

        With this latest round of awards, the joint grant program has funded over $1.3 million since 2000 for university and community college space projects, many of them in partnership with industry.  A listing of the grant projects is attached.  A comprehensive listing of all projects supported since 2000 is posted on FSRI’s website at www.fsri.org/grants.html.

        FSRI is an institute established by Governor Jeb Bush and Florida’s Legislature to stimulate the state’s space industry diversification through academic support to space research and technology programs.  FSGC, hosted at the University of Central Florida, is part of a nationwide NASA-sponsored network of 52 academic consortia responsible for supporting space research and education projects.

Hello Greg!
 
Thanks for your response. However, each of those questions has still not been specifically answered, which still leaves too much room for doubt and concern by Florida families. We will continue to adamantly object to the Learning Gateway/Nanny Bill!!
 
And, I happen to know that only about three of the senators even knew that the Nanny Bill had been attached to the technology initiative bill, and that the Nanny Bill was deceptively attached at the very last moment, apparently as it was the only means to get it passed since it was shot down the first time. This is unacceptable and more and more citizens of this country are immensely displeased with these kinds of political tactics.
 
PLEASE DO NOT SIGN THE NANNY BILL INTO LAW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We can NOT support a governor who rejects family liberties and values for the pursuit of other agendas.

The Governor forwarded your e-mail message to me, so that I may respond to your specific questions about parental involvement and the fiscal impact of the bill.
 
Thank you for your questions regarding the Learning Gateway bill.  As you may know, the bill is a priority of the Senate and was attached to the Centers of Excellence bill that the Governor proposed in his State of the State speech.  
 
As the Governor noted, the Senate’s proposal has been altered greatly in its latest version.  I have attached the Governor’s veto message from last year’s bill that the Governor vetoed.  I have also attached a copy of the bill that passed this year in order to provide some context for the changes that were made to accommodate the Governor’s concerns.  First, parental consent is required and guaranteed for initial contact and referrals.  Second, continued parental involvement is ensured in the bill as they are part of the steering committee, which will administer and approve the demonstration programs.  Finally, while the Legislature’s budget negotiations are ongoing, the level of funding for the program at this time is about $2.6 million, less than half of what was requested last year.
 
I know that the Governor appreciates your concerns on this issue.  If you have further questions, please let me know and I will attempt to answer them.  Thanks again.

Subject: Government Nanny Bill
Importance: High
Hello again, Jeb!
 
OK, here it is…The following content is still in the current Nanny Bill. As long as these parts are still there, I still adamantly oppose the Nanny Bill.
 
Can you please answer each of the questions below, and respond to the last reason regarding the costs of the program, and guarantee your answers?
 
 
1) S.B. 1844 mandates automatic referrals of high-risk newborns to the local Learning Gateway through the Office of Vital Statistics.
Who determines what is considered high risk? There is no parental consent required for this referral. What happens if the parent chooses not to follow up on this referral?
 
2) S.B. 1844 directs that screening processes be developed and tested to address social/emotional/behavioral indicators which could be a sign of future problems.
Will the Florida Department of Children and Families take the child away if the parent chooses to follow his own doctor's advice instead of the government's?
 
3) S.B. 1844 requires that an electronic data system be developed to track children who are screened, assessed, and referred for services.
Will mom and dad be able to remove the child from the government programs if the initial screening is done without parent's consent?
 
4) S.B. 1844 creates a huge, expensive bureaucracy, with the intent of expanding the program statewide.
The pilot project is $6 million the first year for only three counties---what will it cost taxpayers to fund this program for the whole state?
 
Thanks Jeb!

Dear Jeb,
 
With all due respect, I have twice now stated my reasons why I still strongly oppose the Nanny Bill. So, I now ask for you to tell me what specific parts you think have changed and why you support the parts that are left. 
 
I also welcome your thoughts regarding the nightmare with Social Services that happened to my neighbor friend, as mentioned in my previous emails.
 
Can you tell me where I can find your veto message so that I can read it as you requested? It won’t change my opinion or requests for you to veto the Nanny Bill again, as what is left of it is still unacceptable, but I’d at least like to read it.
 
Vetoing the current bill is the only answer for Florida families. The technology initiative bill can be resubmitted at another time, without the Nanny Bill sneakily attached.
 
THANKS Jeb!!

Hi Jeb!
 
I have not received a response from you regarding my last email concerning the Nanny Bill. I am resending my last email here in case you did not receive it the first time. I reiterate my very strong opposition to this bill. The bill is largely unchanged and will still greatly increase the power of the government over children at the expense of parents' rights…UNACCEPTABLE.
 
I know that you believe in parental rights and the rights and strengths of families…that is what has made this country as wonderful as it has become. I’ve relayed my friend’s story to you regarding abuse by the current Social Services Agency here in Orlando and how it overwhelmingly confirms so very much my opposition to even more interference and abuse by the government.
 
The recent stories in the news, regarding missing children in Florida under Social Services’ care, is even greater evidence of how the establishment has degraded and has become dysfunctional for the most part. Over 300 children are missing!! We were in disbelief and quite disappointed that you supported Social Services in a statement you made at Daytona International Speedway last week while at another speaking engagement. We thought that news would have helped you to see what is already wrong with Social Services and how new similar government agencies will cause even more harm to Florida families. YES, there are situations where children need help, but too often the “help” is unjustified and only bogs down and further perverts the operations of the system.
 
What is truly upsetting is the apparent deceptiveness and possible deal-making that has occurred to get this bill to your desk. This is WRONG…I don’t care how long these things have been going on it doesn’t make them right.
 
Jeb, I’m still praying for God to help you make the right decision here, the best decision for ALL Florida residents. If my husband and I were considering having more children, the passing of this bill would be cause enough to definitely choose not to have any more and that’s a horrible choice to have to make. Please veto the bill…the bill the Nanny Bill was attached to can be resubmitted later without the Nanny Bill tacked on…you know they’ll try again.
 
THANKS Jeb! Look forward to hearing from you again. :-)

Hi Jeb!
 
Thanks for responding. I realize that the technology initiative bill that the Nanny Bill was attached to is good but the Nanny Bill needs to be detached from it before you sign it. I still stand by my firm belief that the current Nanny Bill will open up a whole new can of worms with regards to invasion of families’ privacy. Families have been doing just fine for thousands of years and this bill is completely intrusive and unnecessary, including a major drain on our tax dollars and we’re pretty fed up already that a third of our income is already going to many government agencies that we don’t care for and feel are unnecessary and where abuse is already occurring.
 
There are too many questions regarding the content of the current Nanny Bill:
 
1) S.B. 1844 mandates automatic referrals of high-risk newborns to
the local Learning Gateway through the Office of Vital Statistics.
Who determines what is considered high risk? There is no parental
consent required for this referral. What happens if the parent
chooses not to follow up on this referral?
 
2) S.B. 1844 directs that screening processes be developed and tested
to address social/emotional/behavioral indicators which could be a
sign of future problems. Will the Florida Department of Children and
Families take the child away if the parent chooses to follow his own
doctor's advice instead of the government's?
 
3) S.B. 1844 requires that an electronic data system be developed to
track children who are screened, assessed, and referred for services.
Will mom and dad be able to remove the child from the government
programs if the initial screening is done without parent's consent?
 
4) S.B. 1844 creates a huge, expensive bureaucracy, with the intent
of expanding the program statewide. The pilot project is $6 million
the first year for only three counties---what will it cost taxpayers
to fund this program for the whole state?
 
 
This really hits close to home with me, Jeb. I was just informed that one of my neighbors, also a friend, was falsely turned in to Social Services very recently and it has really messed with her head. It was one of our other neighbors, whose children play with my friend's kids, that called in the report. Because of the severity of the false accusations, a Social Services worker responded to the call within an hour and showed up at her house. He required her to "pee in a cup" because she was falsely accused of smoking marijuana. She was so humiliated. Unbeknownst to my friend, the same social worker ("a big black man" according to her kids) then went to her kids' school and interviewed and strip searched all three of her kids (the oldest is 9 or 10 years of age). THIS IS A NIGHTMARE FOR FAMILIES!!!
 
This is the closest I've come to knowing someone who's been through this and it really ticks me off that false accusations can be used to torment a decent family!! Her case is still open, pending a reverse investigation into the family who made the accusations. I told her to give my name as a character reference if needed...I feel so badly for her and her family! GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO GET MUCH MORE INFORMATION BEFORE JUMPING TO STRIP SEARCHING CHILDREN AND MAKING PARENTS GIVE URINE SAMPLES!!!! This kind of business has a demoralizing impact on innocent children and their families!
 
I hope you now understand why I and so many others will continue to oppose this horrible legislation. I’m adamant about it enough that you’ll probably lose my vote in the upcoming election if you sign that Nanny Bill into law. It’s just too wide open for too many frightening repercussions to families who choose not to have the agency’s involvement.
 
I’ve supported you 100%+ and helped vote you into office, mainly because of your strong family values, which is what has made this country what it is today…the land of the free. I hope I will be able to do that again next election. I ask God to help you make the best decision for Florida families.
 
THANKS, Jeb! God Bless!

Lisa, thank you for writing. The learning gateway bill is much, much different than the previous bill that i vetoed. Unfortunately, it is attached to one of our highest priorities, the technology initiative bill that will help accelerate high wage jobs for the future.
 
I ask that you look at the new version and tell me what part of it you disagree with.

Subject: Government Nanny Bill
Dear Governor Bush,
 
My family and I have been following the Government Nanny Bill and have just learned that Senate Majority leader John McKay slipped his Government Nanny Bill (formerly S.B. 88) into S.B. 1844 and that both the Senate and the House passed it today, not realizing that the Nanny Bill had been attached to S.B. 1844 at the last minute. Talk about DECEPTION!!! Apparently, Senator McKay will do anything to achieve his agenda and will stoop as low as possible in his efforts to deceive to make it happen. This man, and anyone like him, should be immediately removed from holding any public office where he represents American people!!
 
Here's what we know about the situation:
 
S.B. 1844 is now the vehicle to create a new government
program called Learning Gateway and will involve "developing
strategies for offering hospital visits or home visits by trained
staff to new mothers."
 
The purpose of Learning Gateway is to screen children from birth to
age 9 for "biological, environmental, and behavioral risks," and
"learning problems." Furthermore, Learning Gateway providers will
conduct "intake with families," conduct "needs/strength-based
assessments of families," and "make referrals for needed services"
and "developmental monitoring."
 
This will all be done in collaboration with the Florida Department of
Children and Family Services and numerous other big government
agencies and programs.
 
Some additional reasons why we oppose S.B. 1844:
 
1) S.B. 1844 mandates automatic referrals of high-risk newborns to
the local Learning Gateway through the Office of Vital Statistics.
Who determines what is considered high risk? There is no parental
consent required for this referral. What happens if the parent
chooses not to follow up on this referral?
 
2) S.B. 1844 directs that screening processes be developed and tested
to address social/emotional/behavioral indicators which could be a
sign of future problems. Will the Florida Department of Children and
Families take the child away if the parent chooses to follow his own
doctor's advice instead of the government's?
 
3) S.B. 1844 requires that an electronic data system be developed to
track children who are screened, assessed, and referred for services.
Will mom and dad be able to remove the child from the government
programs if the initial screening is done without parent's consent?
 
4) S.B. 1844 creates a huge, expensive bureaucracy, with the intent
of expanding the program statewide. The pilot project is $6 million
the first year for only three counties---what will it cost taxpayers
to fund this program for the whole state?
 
Governor Bush, PLEASE DO NOT SIGN THIS BILL!!! Please tell Senator John McKay to stop trampling on parental rights with intrusive, dangerous legislation that is completely anti-family in nature and opens the door for a wide range of government abuses, as well as being a major drain on taxpayers’ money. American people will NOT stand for this!!!!
 
Thanks Jeb…I hope you and your family are doing very well. And thanks for all you do for Florida residents!

Subject: High Tech Bill Signing


Chief,

I spoke with both sets of schedulers about the current plan to do the high 
tech bill signing in Gainesville and Jacksonville.  I know that we are 
running short on time, but I wanted to suggest that we do Tampa and 
Jacksonville.  This is for several reasons:

1.  We will already be in Tampa for the Hurricane Conference.
2.  We should not blow off Chris Hart who made this bill go where it needed 
to go.
3.  If we sign the bill in Gainesville, it will send the signal to the rest 
of the university system that we are biased toward UF.  This is bad because 
we have painstakingly made the effort to ensure buy-off by every university 
in the state.
4.  I know that if we do not go to Boca that Ron Klein will be angry, but 
why have Klein and Hart both angry along with the rest of the university 
system when everyone is already significantly disappointed that the funding 
has been dropped from 50 to 30 million?

These are some thoughts.  If you think that we should still go to 
Gainesville, I will be the loyal soldier.

Brett

A Joint Announcement from:

Fritz S. Steiger
President & CEO
Children First America 
And 
Peter Flanigan
Chairman of the Board of Directors
Children First America

Thursday, May 9, 2002

Fritz S. Steiger

Today I announce that effective September 1, 2002, I will resign my position as President and CEO of Children First America.

It is with much excitement, enthusiasm, joy, and sadness that I make this news known to my staff, board, colleagues, supporters, and friends. This decision has been made in the best interest of my family after much discussion, consideration, and prayer with my wife, Martha. 


After spending the last twelve years in the school choice arena and the last twenty years in public and political affairs, the time has come for me to enter the private sector and pursue some entrepreneurial dreams that will allow me to spend more time with my family. 


In making this announcement, I would like to thank my excellent staff, dedicated board of directors, generous donors, and faithful friends, for the tremendous support they have given me over the years. Most importantly, I would like to thank God for allowing me the privilege to work with such wonderful people in helping to achieve equal educational opportunities for all children in the United States of America, a goal in which I know we will eventually prevail.

Please know that I will continue to be involved in a consulting capacity once we find a successor, as well as continuing to serve on the Board of Directors.


Thank you for your friendship and support. 
Peter Flanigan

Fritz Steiger, the President of Children First America, has informed the Board of Directors of his wish to resign as of September 1, 2002. 

No one has done more to further the cause of educational choice for all of America's children than Fritz Steiger. Under his leadership for more than a decade, Children First has grown to a nationwide organization, sponsoring private voucher programs throughout the country and leading the effort to provide publicly funded vouchers wherever the governmental climate is supportive. As a result of Children First America's efforts, over 100,000 children have been given the opportunity to attend schools that their parents think best for them through nearly 100 private voucher programs. 

Fortunately, Mr. Steiger will continue to help Children First by acting as a consultant and a member of its Board after September 1st. His experience and wisdom will help to maintain the momentum he has created in the school choice movement. 

Everyone connected with Children First - the Board, the Staff, and all its supporters - owe Fritz a debt of gratitude for his extraordinary leadership. His successor will find a high performance organization in place to carry on the work. While he will be sorely missed, all wish Fritz Godspeed and good luck in his new career.

Governor --

I think we can help her, though a preface would be a little much.  What
about a letter along these lines:

***

I like big ideas, and "Resurrection of America!" is full of them.  Marti
Garlow-Lieb has a vision for revitalizing our communities by focusing on our
most precious resource -- our children -- and inspiring them to become civic
leaders of tomorrow.

But "Resurrection of America!" is not just theoretical.  Through her
fouiding of her H.E.M. Club Program in Pensacola, Marti has put a lot of her
ideas into practice, and the results and stories are well worth reading.  It
takes conviction to translate ideas into action that impacts a community,
and Marti's enourmous conviction and dedication are inspiring.

As America takes an extended look at itself following the tragic events of
September 11, we have discovered much to love about out country, and much we
can do to make it even better.  "Resurrection of America!" illustrates how
love and hard work can together change lives for the better.

****

Does this sound like a good way to go, sir?

Yes Sir he has more than enough credits for  college. I think he has 2 or 3 credits more than required. Also he was finally tested this past time like his IEP required in a room away from others with a teacher in there to help if needed. We thought this had been done in the other testing times. He also told us last night that several of his peers that have baseball scholarships won’t get their scholarships if they don’t have a graduation diploma. They will not accept a certificate of completion.  They have been advised to go to shaw(another school) and get their GED. The colleges will accept this. I’m really sorry to bother you with all this  but, these are good kids that have done everything ask of them. Just so you know my son Andrew goes to Bay High School. Thank you for answering back I know you are a very busy person.
Unless you have a child in this situation you don’t realize its happening or at least we didn’t.

theresa, I will look into this situation. here is the challenge. The HSCT is an 8th grade equivalency test. As an exit exam, it should not be as stringent as course work. did your son finish the credit hours necessary to go to college? Did he ask for help given the fact that he is LD? Whatever information you can give me would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: Graduation Diploma
Dear Governor Bush,
My name is Theresa Danzey, and it the last name sounds familiar it is because my husband is Ron Danzey, School Board Member in Bay County.  I have a situation I would like to share with you concerning my son Andrew.
 
First of all, I agree and support testing like the HSCT and FCAT, however this is what has happened in my family.  Andrew is a LD student and was identified as such in and elementary school 10 years ago.  Andrew is about to complete High School and has done everything he was supposed to do.  He made A’s, B’s, C’s and one or two D’s through out his high school years. His attendance has been good and his classroom work has been good.  Our situation is that he has taken the HSCT for the 4th time.  He has passed the math portion, but has fell a few points from passing the language portion. (This is his LD area) I do not feel it is fair for a student who had accomplished everything that has been asked of him to not be allowed a graduation diploma. A certificate of completion does not amply provide or state his accomplishments.  There must be another option for All students who do not test well or have learning disabilities or just learn a different way.
 
This situation has really broken my heart, because I have watched him work hard for the last 4 years and now it apparent that it is all in vain because of ONE test given; instead of looking at the whole child.  Is there anything you can do to help my son?
 
I hope that you and others with our children at heart can take another look at options that will help my son and those like him.
 
Thank you so much for all you do and  for taking time to listen to my concern!
Theresa

Governor, 
        I just wanted to share my opinion that you should NOT  reappoint Rudy Maloy back to the County Commission (regardless of the legal outcome of his case, you did the right thing!).  First, he is an embarrassment to our community, and he exhibits no shame for his actions.  Second, but more importantly, your appointment of Ed DePuy has given us a competent and dedicated public servant who is committed to doing the job properly.  He brings much-needed level headedness (I'm not sure that's a word) and he is open-minded and accessible - and that's all that any citizen can hope for.

        Thanks.

The Investigators: Financial Dealings Of The United Teachers Of Dade
UTD President Angered By Questions
Updated: 12:58 p.m. EDT May 8, 2002

MIAMI --   <http://images.ibsys.com/2001/0510/765073.jpg> Closely guarded financial information about the United Teachers of Dade has been uncovered by the Channel 10 Investigators -- information about debt, loans and the home where UTD President Pat Tornillo lives. 

UNRUH: We've obtained UTD's 1999-2000 financial statements prepared by Grant Thornton accountants detailing the financial affairs of the state's largest teacher's union. We've also been tracking UTD's financial disclosure filings with the state of Florida and the financial picture painted by those documents appears to raise lots more questions than answers. A three-bedroom, three-bath home on Brickell Avenue is owned by the United Teachers of Dade. According to county property records, it's worth one million dollars. It's also the house that UTD president Pat Tornillo calls home -- something that surprised a number of union members. 


DR. SANRA MODEL, TEACHER AT KENWOOD ELEMENTARY: "No, I didn't know that." 


UNRUH: you had no idea? 


MODEL: "No ... I'm a union steward for Kenwood Elementary and I never knew that." 


UNRUH: In fact, no one would know it, just by looking at the financial statements we obtained which only states that some of the property the union owns is "...the building leased by a member of the executive board." 


TORNILLO: "It's an IRS lease. It's a continuing lease." 


UNRUH: Why don't you explain that to us. 


TORNILLO: "Why do I have to explain it you? Why do I have to explain it to Jilda Unruh." 


UTD boss Pat Tornillo, insisted his members know about his housing arrangements but recently refused to answer most questions about it. 


UNRUH: "What do you pay, Pat?" 


TORNILLO: "None of your business." 


UNRUH: Okay, fine. I thought it might be the business of your members. 


TORNILLO "No. But none of your business." 


UNRUH: In a March 19 letter UTD's chief financial officer did say "Mr. Tornillo leases this home from the UTD, and pays rent that is debited from his gross salary. He pays $2,700 monthly." 


But nowhere did that information show up on the union's most recent filing with the state Public Employee Relations Commission Or PERC. 


It lists Tornillo's salary as $225,429, plus an allowance of $17,700. 


In fact, UTD's filing with PERC Revealed some other interesting financial information. 


For example: six UTD employees receive an allowance that is actually bigger than their salary. 


And for the ten UTD employees whose salaries top $100,000 a year, each one also gets an additional $12,000 to $17,000 in allowance money. 


The PERC filing also shows that UTD made loans to 23 individuals between October 1, 2000 and September 30, 2001. 


All but two of those loans appear to be interest free. In fact, according to the union's 1999 to 2000 financials we obtained, the union listed $49,411 in employee loans that were "non-interest bearing." 


But according to UTD's CFO, Jim Angleton "interest was charged on all loans." Again he said, "that information is a mistake." 


Damaris Daugherty, founder of teacher's rights advocacy coalition or TRAC has been pushing the state to force UTD to have their filings comply with state statutes. 


DAUGHERTY: "The whole purpose of filing with PERC is to give members full disclosure so that they know where their money, not UTD's money, their money is going. And UTD has failed to do that." 


Tornillo, angered by our questions about some of UTD's finances, had just one thing to say before he walked away. 


TORNILLO: "We're going to challenge you from here on every time. Every time you open your mouth!" 


UNRUH: UTD insisted that all repayments of loans were through payroll deduction. The union also admitted that repayment of seven of those loans had been waived during the last reporting year due to hardship: among those claiming hardship are three UTD employees with salaries between $86,000 and $112,000. UTD says it no longer makes personal loans to employees.

thanks Shirley. I agree with you that the cause for foster care is many times parental drug and alcohol abuse. The task of the Blue Ribbon Commission is very specific and its mission is very short. there many other opportunities to deal with the broader problems of why we have a dependancy system in the first place.

This e-mail is being transmitted on behalf of Shirley Coletti, President,
Operation PAR, Inc.

Jeb,

I am concerned you have not named an individual to your Blue Ribbon Panel
who can discuss the relationship between crack cocaine and other drugs and
the abuse and neglect of children.  The majority of the cause for foster
care is directly related to parental drug/alcohol abuse.

Jeb, as you know because of your visits to PAR Village, we have a wealth of
expertise I offer to you and the panel members.  During Gov. Martinez's
Administration I chaired what was then called "The Cocaine Baby's Task
Force".  Our focus on the issue caused a recognition by the then Governor
and Legislature to provide some limited support for necessary treatment for
women.  Unfortunately, the momentum halted with the change of Leadership in
our State.

If I can assist you regarding this important matter, please do not hesitate
to call.

Fondly,
Shirley Coletti

Subject:	Re: HB 979

Dear Mr. Coker
 
Thank you for taking the time to reply to me.  You must get hundreds if not thousands of letters and e-mails,  I sincerely appreciate the personal response. 
 
Please pass on to the Governor my response as follows:
 
The premise that the "special district failed to seek the consent of its taxpayers" is bunk and here is why.
    1.  We held four public hearings on the issue.
        Two in the winter months and two in the summer months so our seasonal residents could be here. 
        One in the morning, one in the evening so everyone that wanted to had the opportunity to attend.
    2.  We mailed a newsletter (cost almost $5,000) to every resident of the district explaining our request and inviting residents to our public hearings.
    3. Besides the required legal advertisements, our board purchased regular ads in both local papers.
    4. Our Board adopted the draft language at yet another public hearing
    5. The local news papers (Bradenton Herald and Manatee Herald Tribune) reported on the public hearings.
    6. Our bill was subject to two public hearings before our local legislative delegation.
    7. There were numerous articles in our news papers about our proposed bill after it was filed.
 
By the words he used in the veto message the Governor's implication is that our board of Fire Commissioners are trying to sneak something by the tax payers.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The public has been plugged in throughout the entire process as outlined above.
 
No one opposed this bill - It was supported unanimously by the 5 member locally elected board of fire commissioners. It was unanimously supported by our 5 member legislative delegation.  It passed the House and Senate without the first descending vote.  The Governor did not receive one e-mail,  letter, or phone call in opposition.  The only person who opposed this bill was the Governor.
 
Why would our Governor be opposed?  This must have been a bad bill, or something bad for our community.  No, the Governor vetoed this bill because we failed to follow his new rules.  Rules he only published in late February, well after the point we could have held a referendum, even if we wanted to.  It was the first week of March when I found out about them.
 
Did he veto it because our rates are excessive?  If he had asked, we would have shown that we have not adjusted our assessment caps since 1993, nearly 10 years.  Our impact fees have not changed in twenty years, since 1982.  Further research would have shown the Governor that our rates are well below most of the other fire districts in our county and way below our surrounding counties.  A quick glance at our audits, he would have seen we have been deficit spending for the last two years, reducing our reserves instead of raising assessments.  Did he veto it on any of these facts?  No, it was vetoed because we did not follow his new rules.
 
The fact is we were never asked the first question by the Governor or his staff.  We never had the opportunity to make our case.  The first clue we had that there was a problem was when a neighboring district had there codification language vetoed.  Then we started franticly calling and writing to no avail.
 
I believed our Governor supported local control and smaller and less intrusive government.  I also thought the Governor would support the fire department and us firefighters.  But actions speak louder than words,  I was wrong.  By his actions, he told us he knows what our fire department needs better than our locally elected officials.  So much for government closer to the people, Tallahassee knows best.
 
His creating these new rules with out any notice or input  just made government that much bigger and more intrusive.   We tried, we complied with all Statutes, House and Senate rules, and thought we had done everything we were required to do.  We were not trying to subvert the Governor or the taxpayers.  
 
We will jump through the new hoops he has setup again next year.  We will hold a referendum - at tax payers expense.  I just hope more hoops don't get setup after we jump through these.
 
As a result of the Governors veto,  we will institute a hiring freeze at our next Fire Commissioners meeting.  Hopefully we will make it through the next fiscal year without having to reduce our staffing or park any fire trucks.  We had hoped to increase our staffing to try to comply with the new 2-in 2-out firefighter safety standard recently mandated by the State Fire Marshal's Office (rule 4A-62),  instead we may have to declare a state of financial emergency.
 
Thank you for you continued support .

Dear Mr. Quaderer 

Thank you for your note to the Governor expressing your support for House Bill 979, relating to Cedar Hammock Fire Control District.  The Governor asked that I respond on his behalf.

The Governor’s office reviews all bills during the legislative process and in addition, local bills undergo an individual review process.  Given the diverse nature of issues addressed in local bills, the Governor has developed standard criteria by which to evaluate these bills.  The criteria generally provide that citizens impacted by revisions to the authority of the special district should be provided an opportunity for expressing their views by referendum.  Since this bill increases the maximum non-ad valorem assessment rates which may be levied and the special district failed to seek the consent of its taxpayers who could be significantly and adversely impacted by the changes, the Governor could not support this piece of legislation.

Again, thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts with Governor Bush. 

Sincerely,

Kathleen,

	Letter looks good; selection is right choice.  Only question is
whether to act.  This is big defense politics (your former boss can give you
the flavor of that).  That is not to say that our boss isn't into big
politics, but chances are he will not be seen as personally aware of the
choices and the implications.

	The reserves and the National Guard in particular are going through
a major conceptual --and therefore actual -- transformation.  So are the
regular forces (Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines).  They and their
civilian bosses (the service chiefs, Department of Defense, others) pay
close attention to the decisions and why they were made, who recommended
what, and why they did so.  

	Bottom line.  I would tread lightly here.

style, but it does tell the entire story. The part about the "drill status"
experience is important, as it shows experience outside of the "beltway" and
an ability to relate to the employer/guardsmen/family challenges facing our
personnel.

The strong characteristic of Genera Rees is LEADERSHIP and his concern for
the "State Mission" that gives the Governor's the federal equipment and
personnel for the Governor's needs during response to hurricanes, forest
fires, civil issues, or events of domestic terrorism.

I have verified the experience and facts expressed within the document.

Governor Bush,
I can't thank you enough for taking the time to visit with our guests from the North Carolina General Assembly last week.  After their visit here and the information they collected from all  the dedicated people involved in making Florida Forever such a success, they are preparing to file a bill that will provide more permanent funding for land and water conservation across North Carolina.
 
They were particularly impressed with the Florida Communities Trust program and the fact that local governments manage the land after its purchased, reducing the state's land management costs.
 
We are so proud to have such a program to tell other states about.  The Trust for Pubic Land appreciates your personal investment in Florida Forever, it means so much to communities all over the state!  Be on the lookout for North Carolina Forever!
 
 I hope you enjoy the Dogwood.  
 
Sincerely,

She has stated to me and others that she would like to meet the President. I am told that the President will visit Miami to address Cuban Americans on May 20th or around May 20th for Cuban Independence Day. Brittany is terminal and may only have a few months to live. Please try to arrange for Brittany and her grandmother to meet the President. She has touched my heart and that of others, including yours.

Boy Dies in Foster Care; Birth Mom Finds Out a Week Later
The Associated Press 
TAVARES, Fla. (AP) - The biological mother of a 23-month-old boy who
drowned
at a foster home wasn't told what happened by Department of Children &
Families workers until several days after the toddler's death. 
Austin Rogers died last Friday after spending two days in critical
condition
at Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children & Women in Orlando. He was found
limp
by his foster father in an aboveground pool. 
His biological mother, Bonnie Turner, 20, said she wasn't notified by
DCF
workers until Wednesday. Turner's parental rights were terminated in
April. 
"Legally, there was no obligation to tell her," said Janice Johnson, DCF
deputy district administrator. "Legally, everything is severed." 
But Turner, who lives with her mother in Tavares, said a final court
hearing
to terminate her rights was scheduled until May 14. She also said the
baby's
father, Jeremy Mills, 28, has not signed any paperwork. 
Austin was born with cerebral palsy and was put in foster care two days
later. 
Johnson said the drowning had been ruled an accident, but the Lake
County
Sheriff's Office said Wednesday the case is still under investigation. 
According to police and DCF reports, Austin's foster parents, Ysidoro
and
Tinnie Campos, lost track of the child for only a few moments May 1.
Ysidoro
Campos, 40, had been playing with five children in the front yard while
his
wife worked inside their Groveland home. 
"Two minutes, two minutes and we realized he was missing," Ysidoro
Campos
said. "Everybody was looking everywhere. None of the kids ever got in
the
pool without being supervised." 
Ysidoro Campos found the baby unconscious in the pool, according to
police
reports. Two children told police Austin was missing about three to five
minutes and that Campos started cardiopulmonary resuscitation when he
found
the toddler. 
Authorities said there was a chain-link fence around the pool and a gate
with a padlock on it but the gate wasn't padlocked on the day Austin was
found in the pool. Ysidoros Campos told authorities that one of the
older
children must have left the gate unlocked. 
A DCF counselor noted in Austin's files that the Campos were attentive
foster parents who kept a close watch on the children in their care. 
After the drowning, DCF officials removed two boys, ages 4 and 8, from
the
Campos' home. Tinnie Campos said the couple was supposed to have been in
court Wednesday for the adoption of two other children, ages 7 and 12.
They
have already adopted the two children's 11-year-old brother, and they
also
have two older children. 
DCF officials said the Camposes were being considered as potential
adoptive
parents to Austin. 
"God gave him to us, and I won't question why he took him," Ysidoro
Campos
said. "I have a hollow place in my heart."

I've been reading about the problem with DCF.  We both know if you have a dishonest employee, you have a problem that can't be resolved til the truth is out. 
 
BUT MAYBE THE PROBLEM IS THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF FOSTER CARE.   When you have to pay families to take in children, can you really be sure caring and love are the motive.   
 
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT MAYBE A RADICAL SOLUTION IS NEEDED - namely stop the individual home placement and limit it to group homes.  This way you have easier supervision, you have better chance for accountability, and better oversight when more than one person (or family) is involved in the care.    
 
Of course, the better solution would be to start by preventing anyone on welfare from having a child using avaiable birth control methods.     And if they have a child while on welfare, take all children away and cut off benefits.   Use the money to feed the children in a group home, and let such an irresponsible person suffer the consequences of being self supporting.  BUT THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN IN MY LIFETIME................ so perhaps we can go back to something that helped create  a lot of valuable members of society..   (maybe look at the home in Titusville.  From what I've seen, it teaches responsiblbity and has had success with better school grades.      Its one of the few things done well in titusville.

Governor Bush,

Perhaps you have already seen the following article in today's Wall Street
Journal, but I wanted to pass it along as it contains some tremendous
insight into several areas of critical importance.  The headline doesn't
tell the real story of the several trillion dollars that have been lost to
the nation's investing public, including many pension plans, as a result of
the regulatory approach of the past few years.  As the article points out,
the problems arose from many corners, not the least of which was the
approach taken by the FCC under Reed Hundt's administration.  The real
answer is to find a way through the regulatory maze to put the market to
work, creating real incentives for investment in new technology, and
thereby creating real jobs and real wealth for the citizens of the land.
There is a tremendous amount of information packed into this little
article, and I commend it to you.

Business World: Telecom's Curse: Too Many Lobbyists

By Holman W. Jenkins Jr.


The Wall Street Journal via Dow Jones

  It hardly seems like a mere five years ago that WorldCom was plopping
into the
middle of the business world's consciousness with a $30 billion bid for
long-distance carrier MCI.

  Bernie Ebbers, he of the cowboy boots, was offering MCI shareholders
WorldCom
stock, then priced at a multiple of nearly 100. Investors at the time were
enthralled by the idea of the senile old phone companies being overrun by
the
Internet. His rival for MCI's affections, GTE's Charles Lee, was one of
those
old telephone guys but he had a different idea. He dared to offer a lower
price
for MCI but in Plain Old Cash.

  Mr. Ebbers won the battle but it's clear now who won the war. WorldCom
teeters
toward bankruptcy as its former chief licks his financial wounds on the
sidelines. Meanwhile, GTE went on to marry itself with Verizon, the
super-monopolist that dominates the Northeast and looks like one of the few
survivors of the spending frenzy of recent years.

  We won't weep for Mr. Ebbers, but such is the outcome when billions are
thrown
at opportunities designed by Washington rather than the market. Looking
back,
regulatory policy had become insane. Local Bells were being allowed to
merge
with Bells on the ground that, hey, they were already monopolies so what
difference did it make if they got bigger? Yet regulators stood fast
against a
sensible coalescence of the local and long-distance businesses to form a
single,
undifferentiated business called phone service.

  This was half the telecom meltdown right here. Out of every dollar paid
for
long distance, 93 cents goes to the overhead, billing and marketing costs
of
maintaining a separate long-distance industry. Any business built on such a
non
sequitur can't be long for the world. Long distance needed an orderly
burial,
but regulatory politics and telecom's lobbying wars got in the way.

  The other half of the disaster has its roots in Washington's regulatory
fumbling of broadband. Mike Armstrong has been working valiantly to dig
AT&T out
of the dying long-distance business by buying cable TV networks and
converting
them to two-way broadband. But it hasn't been a fun ride for AT&T
shareholders.
No sooner did he begin investing billions to build a digital pipe into
millions
of homes than competitors were demanding "open access" from regulators.
Now,
with this battle in remission, he finds himself fighting regulators and
rivals
over his attempt to merge his cable systems with those of Comcast.

  But the cable guys have hardly been innocents themselves, constantly
badgering
Congress and the FCC to hog-tie the Baby Bells' own broadband effort. State
legislators in Oklahoma finally got fed up and just deregulated
Southwestern
Bell's broadband business. In turn, the company announced plans last month
to
roll out service to 37 more towns.


  Sadly, not even Intel and a host of Silicon Valley worthies who recently
marched on Washington have managed to break a similar impasse there. They
just
keep bouncing off Ernest Hollings, the irascible Democrat who chairs a key
Senate panel and likes being the scourge of whatever big business his staff
points him at.

  History will want to know how we came to throw away $1 trillion of
bondholders' money while knocking $2 trillion off the collective wealth of
telecom shareholders in the 1990s. Here's how:

  Much of the wasted spending was actually predicated on a funny notion
embodied
in the '96 telecom law -- or at least the law as interpreted by Reed Hundt,
the
Al Gore protege who served as FCC chairman. His vision, dreamed up out of
the
whisperings of countless lobbyists, was that regulation should hold the
incumbent Bells in place while start-up competitors cherry picked their
businesses to death.

  This notion had a certain charm but was hardly necessary to keep the
world
moving forward. Wireless, satellite, cable and various other challengers
were
coming along anyway. Better that this investment had been made without
illusion
and without pathetic reliance on regulators, which turned out to be one of
the
worst gambles of all time. In the end the '96 act was successful mainly for
the
permanent gusher of campaign contributions it created.

  Mr. Armstrong at AT&T believes the '96 model can still work, and he's had
some
luck with state regulators lately. But a business plan built on expecting
the
Bells to cooperate in their own overthrow would seem a recipe for
frustration.
"Economics always wins out. Crazy, convoluted schemes never work," says one
telecom CEO.

  In comparison, WorldCom's Mr. Ebbers didn't seem to have any road map at
all
beyond continuing to make deals and grab telecom properties while telecom
was a
scarce resource.

  Hard to believe, but there was a moment when it seemed it might run out.
AOL
and other Internet hookup providers had gone to flat-rate, all-you-can eat
pricing. The standard three- to five-minute phone call the old system was
designed to handle had suddenly become a call that lasted all week.
Old-time
Bell engineers were worried the system would bog down under the surge in
demand.


  While it lasted, Mr. Ebbers was earning astronomical margins from
Internet
backbone. Indeed, even with all the lousy policy out of Washington, telecom
might still be levitating today if the courts had upheld Napster and
Hollywood
was busting a gut to offer a digital business model of its own.

  Too bad. Now the industry's biggest millstone is its own lobbying armies.
Telecom players need to do deals -- lots of them -- to clean up and
consolidate,
but trench warfare between the factions in Washington has made getting
anything
done almost impossible.

  We've got a wireless industry with too many players, a consumer
long-distance
industry that needs to be absorbed by the Bells, and needless regulatory
obstacles to broadband. The only way anything is going to get fixed is if
everyone puts down their battleaxes and agrees to let technological rather
than
regulatory competition drive the future.

To the Honorable Governor Jeb Bush; 
Lt. Governor Frank T. Brogan; Commissioner of Education Charlie Crist; and the Secretary of Education Jim Horne;




I thank you for this year's Governor's Educators' Leadership Summit. Every facet of this year's summit evidenced yet again that the utmost priority of this administration has been and still is Education.

Over many years and in many ways, we Florida Educators have become complacent concerning what is truly important in education. We came to expect mediocrity from government and in turn have accepted mediocrity from education simply because it is labeled a "government institution". I am so thankful that the Florida Bush administration has laid down the gauntlet by saying, "No!" to complacency and saying, "Yes!"  to excellence in both government and education once more. 

The vision of "Just Read, Florida" raises the bar of expectations in Education back to where it should be. "Just Read, Florida!  reminds us all that the basic goal of education is to empower every child with the literacy skills to become productive citizens.  The concrete steps taken by this administration to positively impact education through unprecedented increased funding, support to classroom teachers, and solicitation of parental and community involvement are noted and applauded by those of us at the very heart and soul of education, the classroom teacher. 

As we near the end of this school term, I thought the timing of the Summit was most appropriate. This is the time of year teachers are called upon to assess their students' performance and issue grades that represent individual students' achievements. This brought to my mind the question ,"What grades would I give Jeb, if I had to assess his performance and the performance of his administration?" So, if you would indulge my "teacher imagination",  then these are the "grades" I believe you have earned. 

A+ in your Acceptance of all children and the refusal to leave any child behind. 

A+ in the Accountability for all school districts, administrators, teachers, parents, and students to measure the quality of learning taking place in our Florida Schools by means of  FCAT testing and a School Grading System.

 A+ for Achievement of all students reading on grade level by 2012. The "Just Read, Florida!" initiative boldly declares that putting reading first in Education is a "reasonable service" shared by every Florida parent, educator, and citizen. 

A+ for your Accessibility to all schools and educators through school visits, community dialogue, and events like, The Governor's Educators' Leadership Summit. 

Gentlemen, according to this Florida Educator, you have earned straight A's.

Thank you, again for the opportunity to be a part of a Summit focusing on the singular most important goal of Education, that of teaching all Florida children to just.....read.

Sir, 

I kayak on the Loxahatchee River and I spent the entire day paddling on it this past Sunday. I understand, today you are on the river in a canoe. What I wanted to bring to your attention is that the water level of the river has changed between the time I was there Sunday and when I was there early this morning. Though we have had no rain at all, the water level this morning was considerably higher. I assume this was done in preparation of your visit. I don't know if this has any effect on the reason for your visit today, but I just thought you should know, somehow, someone consciously must have caused the rise in water level. Maybe if you want to see the river the way it really is you should take a canoe trip with out first pre-announcing your intentions. Canoes and kayaks can be rented at the headwaters of the Loxahatchee seven days a week at Canoe Outfitters of Florida... Their phone number is... 1 888 272-1257

Dear Governor Bush,
     Thank you!!!! In today's mail, at school, arrived a beautiful envelope from the White House. We are not telling Jacob what it is. I am having it professionally framed and presented to him at his 5th grade graduation at the end of May. He is an ESE student with behavior problems but like my custodian said to me today, "Mrs. Gates, who knows, this could turn him around!" We never give up on children. 
     I will check when the graduation date is. I know that you are booked for probably the next 10 years solid, but one never knows when an opening may occur. It would make a wonderful photo op for your "education" campaign. Our school is a success story. We were a "C" school and last year achieved an "A" status. We are titled a "Global School". Each year we highlight 4 different countries to learn about their cultures. We are also a Title 1 school. Many children have barely ventured outside of Brooksville.
     I teach 4th grade. Since our children are language deprived, I take them on field trips to enrich their spoken and written vocabulary, with the FCAT writing test in mind. If you haven't experienced, how can you write? SO! This year I have taken them to Tarpon Springs to see the inside of St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Cathedral. They were awestruck by the 24 carat gold laden icons, stained glass windows and crystal chandeliers. We then took a boat ride and watched a diver don a traditional sponge diver's suit to retrieve sponges off the river's floor. Many of my students wrote later that they had never been on a boat.
   Just last month we took a trip to Ybor City. I hired two tour guides to accompany us on a bus and walking guided tour. They got to step on "Cuban" soil at the Jose Marti Park. We ordered 45 loaves of cuban bread from the Segunda Bakery to take back to our families and share our experiences around the dinner table that night. Some of the loaves were bigger than the children as they carried them to their buses after school. It was hysterical!
   Please tell your brother thanks a million. His letter will probably be cherished by this child for the rest of his life!
 
Sincerely,

Governor Bush,
    The day after your brother announced that the children of America need to bring a dollar for the Afghan children, a student at our school, Jacob Jericho, listened. There is an adorable article and picture in the Hernando Today newspaper, October 13, 2001.
    I would love to send a copy of the article to him, but considering the mail situation, that is probably impossible. I think he would enjoy seeing it. Is there a safe place I can send it to? Maybe to you? They have a website hernandotoday.com. Someone could at least pull it up there for him to read.
    This child is a former student of mine. He is an ESE student with special needs, but he has a really strong

Governor Bush;

   Attached is the updated consortium report. This updated report clarifies more of the frame work that the consortium members are suggesting. 

   The consortium would also like to report it is gaining in membership daily and will be forwarding an updated Wind Strom Consortium membership list later next week. We have found there is a great deal of concern from the building industry and the private citizens of our great state on this issue.

    The Consortium hopes you and Secretary Siebert find these changes beneficial.

Thank You

Jay E Jones Consortium Chair

Governor:
 
I just heard you were in my backyard in Homestead today and I didn't get the chance to see you. I am so disappointed.
 
 
Maybe next time.
 
Fondly,
 
Lois
 
PS:  My thoughts are with you during the DCF matter.  I know how troubling you must feel, but please remember this is not because of anything you did or did not do.  This issue has been festering for decades when the Dems were there and they did nothing.  Now they expect you to work miracles in less than four years.  
 
Janet Reno needs to keep her mouth shut also considering all the baggage she drags behind her including authorizing the death of children and women in Waco. Where does she get off criticizing you? Anyway, that too will be resolved in November at the polls.  
 
So, keep your head up.  Now that it is exposed, ugly as it is, it has served to unite forwardly-thinking Floridians behind you, meaning you will be supported statewide in any effort to clean it up.  
 
I am confident you will find the answer.
 
Lois

Good Evening!
I met Bill last year at an event in Broward and we discussed this
possibility.  I ran the Legal Aid Clinic at Notre Dame as a student and see
the great value in clinical work for law students.  Sr. Jeanne is also
interested in engaging the local universities to do pro bono guardian ad
litem work.

     Governor:  As you may recall, my wife is planning director for DCF in
     Broward. So, you can imagine that we spend a lot of time talking about
     the department as we did for the five years we were in Jacksonville
     where she also did planning for DCF in Duval.
     One of the results of our discussions was the establishment of a
     unique law school clinic at DCF sponsored by Florida Coastal. I had
     the privilege of serving as Associate Dean for Skills at Florida
     Coastal. The thought occurs to us that one way of addressing some of
     the issues of children at risk is to marshall of the law schools in
     Florida to establish a clinical program whereby law students work with
     DCF staff and lawyers to handle children in placement including doing
     some of the guardian at litem issues. This would have a three-fold
     value. First, it would train new lawyers to deal with public service
     issues for the future whether they enter government service or the
     private practice of law. Second, this would be an excellent service
     venue for students and third, this would fill a vital need. I don't
     have all of the answers and this might not be well received by our
     insular and turf-oriented law schools; but I think this could work.
     Florida Coastal had a good relationship with District Four and we had
     a number of students come through the clinic with a sense of what DCF
     does and how they can help. Perhaps if you think there is some value
     to this  you can consider it as part of any "solutions" for DCF and
     see if the Judge Kearney considers it valuable. Of course, if you or
     she need additional information or ideas related to this, I would be
     delighed to help. I know how hard DCF people work and Ellen and I
     appreciate your support of DCF which came through during today's video
     conference. I would hate to see us trash the department which does so
     much good because of a singular or limited problem. Please let me know
     what you think of the clinic idea. As always, my best wishes and
     support.

Dear Jeb-
I realize that you are up to your ears in alligators at this time, but I
just wanted you to know that it is possible to work through the morass
and backlog in the dependency area.

Judge Roche and I were well fought our first year or so on the bench
with the "changes" we were demanding.  Those "changes" were nothing less
than complying with the statutes enacted.  The results for Orange County
after less than 2 1/2 years of hard work and hundreds of dependency and
termination of parental rights trials is that over 4,000 children have
reached permanency. [translation-through adoption, long term relative
care or reunification, DCF is no longer involved in these children
lives]. Foster Care is down nearly 50%. Trials can be held in the
required 60 days.  Ancillary result- resources, both human and
financial, are now available for the children  under DCF's manageable
case load. imagine what could have been accomplished with all parties
pulling in the same direction.

The problem is solvable.  People need to be motivated towards
resolutions.

My thoughts and prayers are with you at this difficult time.

Sincerely,

Judge Janet C. Thorpe

PS.  Thanks for signing SB 618.  I'll definitely breathe easier after
next Friday's qualifying is over.

Governor, In 2000, the NAACP Board of Directors approved by resolution a  moratorium on all death row executions until then President Clinton and all US governors could conduct a clear, comprehensive review and study on the fairness and accuracy of the death penalty. 

Today, Governor Parris Glendening imposed a moratorium on executions in the state of Maryland. His leadership falls in line with the NAACP's position against the death penalty.  It is my hope that a nationwide moratoriu would be place on all such executions and hereby, request for your leadership take part in such fair position. 

For the Good of the People!

I know your life is hectic and too many people make too many demands, and
requests but this could be a big help to you.

You had to cancel attending Informed Families' 20th Anniversary Joe's Stone
Crab Dinner on May 20th because of a White House Event.  I assumed that
event was in DC, when I read that it is a Cuban celebration in Miami, I see
a great opportunity for Republicans to reach out and be more inclusive.

In the last twenty years, Nancy Reagan's Parent Movement, The National
Family Partnership (NFP) and Informed Families have been the most successful
and cost effective
way to reduce casual drug use in America. By changing social norms and
enlisting large numbers of parents and schools to participate in our
programs, people become partners in the prevention process.  Unfortunately,
this is the Republican's best kept and little understood secret. 

You have a unique and wonderful opportunity to connect the dots for the
press, the public and the parents.  Republicans have been on the leading
edge of supporting
parents, kids, schools and reducing alcohol and drugs. Let's tell the public
about this ongoing work!

How?   By either stopping by the Joe's event anytime from
6:30-9:30 pm or coming by our building at 2490 Coral Way anytime that day to
see our new classrooms for parents and kids, funded by The Knight
Foundation, Bell South, etc.

Visiting Informed Families will generate interest and support at the local,
state,
and national level since NFP is headquartered at Informed Families and
I am the national president of the 67 affiliates nationwide.

A stop by/photo op would help Informed Families and NFP recruit more parents
to participate in prevention, which is certainly part of the President's
agenda.

I have just agreed to sit on NIDA's Advisory Council at the request of Tommy
Thompson's office to get the President's agenda of Faith Based Initiatives
and Prevention on NIDA's agenda.  As you know sitting on this Council and
trying to sway opinion in this direction is not going to be easy, pleasant,
or fun. A picture of you, Columba, and the President at the Joe's event or
at Informed Families' new classrooms would convey at least 1,000 words while
actually helping people understand how to participate in drug prevention.

So Jeb, that's it...please try not to miss this natural win/win opportunity!
Thanks for your consideration and help. Let me know what you think.

FLUFF: A History of Teaching Arithmetic"

Teaching Arithmetic in 1950: A logger sells a truckload of lumber for $100.
His cost of production is 4/5 of the price. What is his profit?

Teaching Arithmetic in 1960: A logger sells a truckload of lumber for $100.
His cost of production is 4/5 of the price, or $80. What is his profit?

Teaching Arithmetic in 1970: A logger exchanges a set "L" of lumber for a
set "M" of money. The cardinality of set "M" is 100. Each element is worth
one dollar. Make 100 dots representing the elements of the set "M." The set
"C", the cost of production contains 20 fewer points than set "M." Represent
the set "C" as a subset of set "M" and answer the following question: What
is the cardinality of the set "P" of profits?

Teaching Arithmetic in 1980: A logger sells a truckload of lumber for $100.
His cost of production is $80 and his profit is $20. Your assignment:
Underline the number 20.

Teaching Arithmetic in 1990: By cutting down beautiful forest trees, the
logger makes $20. What do you think of this way of making a living? Topic
for class participation after answering the question: How did the forest
birds and squirrels feel as the logger cut down the trees? There are no
wrong answers.

Teaching Arithmetic in 2001: A logger sells a truckload of lumber for $100.
His cost of production is $120. How does Arthur Andersen determine that his
profit margin is $60?

Subject: Let Joey Meyer Graduate with his classmates


 
Governor Bush and Mr. Charlie Crist,
*please forward to Mr. Crist as we didn't get his email, feel free to forward anywhere you feel might help. See you Friday at C.A.F.E., Joey will be there with us. :0) 
Self-Advocating 101 is right up his alley.

You know what is happening in St. Cloud Florida, just outside the Orlando area at the St. Cloud High School. 
 
The Principle of St. Cloud High School won't let Joey Meyer graduate with his classmates or participate in the graduation ceremony, because April 15, just weeks before graduation for Joey was to take place, the school is saying that he hasn't met all his required credit requirements. 
 
There are several agencies getting involved with this and it is making quiet a stir in the media and radio talk shows. Some thing's are being said of this student, because he has Down syndrome. The student council president sent a not so nice email to the radio station, which was read on the air and saying, something to the fact that the class doesn't really want him to participate in the graduation ceremonies, because; it would "compromise" the integrity of the whole graduating class. Much of the information contained in that email was more of administrative information and not student body privileged information. Students who have come to the home have expressed no poll or questionnaire was circulated therefore it is not the views of the entire senior class by far.
 
Senator Bill Nelson has just stepped in and offered to have Joey Meyer be included in their summer internship program; with or without his high school diploma! Another organization is also stepping in to give Joey is 'very own' graduation with full military escorts and a huge party and an honoree diploma in place of his high school diploma, set for Sunday May, 19th at 2 pm. These are all nice community supportive actions. 
 
As a parents of child(ren) who have been in the Florida school system since 1988, working through the ESE Department, IDEA and 504 for many, many years this concerns us greatly. We have not yet seen all of Joeys IEP's, Mrs. Meyers will fax them, she assures us she has been to most of the meetings and signed the plans which in deed state Joey is scheduled to graduate May 2002. Please help us understand why the iron door is shut on participation. Lee County has hit some real bumps in the road the past few years in the error of the school board and many exceptions and rules have been bent or changed to provide for the "best interest" of the education of children. One example being the fire code violations. Millions of dollars appeared and many provisions were aloud for the schools to move forward and get it right in time. They opened on time and remained open although they had not met their requirements. Please see what I am saying, there are waivers or provisions that can allow him to participate. Why is it that the state can get a waiver or make the rules bend when they are in need, here is a child with the weight of the world on his shoulders none of us could begin to imagine. You nor we can ever know what it is like to wake up every day knowing we are so different by no fault of our own, than a child with a disability. Every day it amazes us with the issues they face they laugh and bring joy to all of us around them. 
 
We just wanted to pass this information on to you, as it would seem you may be able to help or offer some suggestions on who, what or where to go for immediate action in helping us have Joey be involved in his classmates graduation ceremony with out entering the legal forum. 
 
We believe this could be turned into an awesome learning experience for the entire school body about children not the same as them and their need to be included and why. Time is of the essence because Graduation is scheduled for Monday, May 20th.
 
Enclosed are some Orlando Sentinel News articles to let you know about this situation. If you read the polls you will see the majority is behind us.
 
Please help, give us some advice on what more we can do...
 
A copy of this email is being sent to the Meyers, which you could send them some info too...but they are being flooded with well over 200 supportive emails an hour from all over the country at this point. We are helping the Meyers by being two of their many Advocates. Anything you can advise us on will be greatly appreciated.
 
Thank you.

The budget is essentially done. We got rid of several very offensive sections of proviso and the implementing bill in the last two days...it has been a gueling process this year...too much time!

We are preparing spredsheets to show you what we got/did not get in the budget, and preparing a press release for monday.

Dear Governor Bush:

I would like to commend you and your Cabinet for ordering Polk County 
officials to reconsider a proposal to build a school in the Haines City area. 
I live in that area and the need for a new High school/middle school is 
tremendous. The High school is currently supporting approximately double the 
amount of students it was originally intended to house.

Personally, I feel the state needs to take a very close look at the entire 
school district leadership. From what the local newspapers say we have the 
highest dropout rate in the state and just recently of the ten counties that 
surround Polk, it is the only one which failed to come up with some sort of 
compensation package for its teachers. Polks teachers are not receiving one 
penny raise this year and as a matter of fact are actually making less than 
last year because of insurance increases passed on to the individual 
teachers. Where is the Polk County money going and where is the good 
management apparently present in the ten surrounding counties?? What is going 
on? Perhaps someone needs to take a look!

Sincerely, 
Jerry Dunbar

Dear Governor Bush,

     Thank you for inviting me to "crash" the Florida reading summit. This 
temporary resident of Massachusetts has decided that there is no better place 
to reside after graduation than Florida. The collaboration among educators, 
government, and businesses at the summit insures that Florida will be leading 
the country in reading. Thank you also for getting me in touch with Cheryl 
Cliett. Cheryl, as you well know, is amazing, but I wanted to remind you of 
yet another reason why.  Cheryl went to great lengths to insure that "little 
'ole me" had an opportunity to meet with all the reading superstars in the 
state during my visit. What is even more amazing is that she managed to do 
this in the midst of planning the summit, an impeccably planned and executed 
tribute to Florida's great teachers. Finally, Governor Bush, thank you for 
indulging a proud father and his daughter with a warm greeting and picture 
during your visit to Citicorp.  It meant a lot to me, and I know it meant even 
more to my dad who really thinks you are neat. Again, I am thrilled that I 
will be returning to Florida and particularly excited that it will be under 
your sincere and devoted leadership.

Many thanks and warm regards,
Sarah Seegers

This was in the local paper this morning. They all look good!!!!!   For what its worth.




District 1: Retired News Journal publisher Cliff Barnhart, former Commissioner Wilson Robertson and brokerage firm owner Eugene Franklin appear to be the leading choices.

District 2: Retired Vice Adm. Tim Wright, managing director of the University of West Florida's Institute for Human and Machine Cognition, and former state Rep. Lois Benson are strong contenders.

District 3: Pensacola City Council member Marie Young, a Democrat, and educator Ulysses Hughes, the Republican administrator of the Ruby J. Gainer Charter School, appear to be the favorites.

District 5: Janice Gilley, whom Bush called on to fill suspended Escambia County School Board member Vanette Webb's seat in 1999, is the presumed appointee.

Dear Governor Bush.

I have written to you several times regarding my
desire to work in a challenging position in the
Healthcare area within Miami or Fortlauderdale.
Governor, I have a Master's Degree in Health Services
Administration, and have worked in the Agency for
Healthcare Adminsitration for close to five years in
Miami,where I was very well recognized for my
excellent work, but did not find the position  very
challenging, and my qualifications were not fully
utilized. 

I finally decided to become qualified as a licensed
nursing home administrator, in order to contribute
more to the community, and therefore persued that
route the whole of last year while working at AHCA.
Now I am ready to sit for my board exam which will
qualify me as a nursing home administrator. 


Governor, I have seen you pushing for diversity,
and trying to give well deserved opportunities to
women and minorities. I am a minority, living in this
country for over 20 years, persued my university
degrees here and,  now I am ready to contribute my
knowledge and expertise for the betterment of our
community, but have not been given that opportunity
that fits my qualifications. I am completely well
versed in the rules and regulations that govern the
nursing home industry, and am very qualified to hold a
position in the policy making area of the nursing home
industry in the government. 

I hope you will consider my request. 

Hope to hear from you soon.

Ahmed sends his regards.

Thanks,

Nasreen Kabani

Hey, I reread that. It actually isn't what I'd hoped for, so let me ask it another way. 


You've said below that if you end up not agreeing with me that you will be kind enough to inform me before the announcement is made. I really do appreciate that and I know that this is your responsibility, not mine, and that I have handed off any rights in the matter by my resignation. I respect that and I trust you. 


That having been said, I would ask, if your considerations go in a different direction, that you allow me the opportunity to speak with you BEFORE a decision is made. One of the things I love about you is that you do stick to your path, once your research is finished and a decision is made. Please allow me to be part of informing that decision if you decide to pursue other directions. 


Man, I don't want to push you, Governor. But it would just about kill me to have someone appointed who disrespected the process and the work that meant so much to me. And I'm frankly having a hard enough time without staggering under that. So this is just a simple yes or no request to help me deal with the insomnia this is causing. Have your heart and your mind still open for reconsideration when you call me. That is genuinely all I ask for in recognition of my service in the position. 


Good night and take care, 


Nora

Governor, 


It is my great hope that you will see your way clear to appoint Mr. John Verdon as quickly as possible to replace me on the Monroe County Commission. John, 58, is a long-time Republican, and held public office in a small town for many years (5 terms, and served as Mayor). He has already submitted his Appointment materials to your office. As names come out of the woodwork, I have come to realize that I will carry a heavy burden indeed if my replacement is not someone who is responsible, smart, well-meaning, and with a kind-heart. I can tell you that, of the field that is emerging, John is the only candidate whose appointment will lighten that burden for me. Thank you so much for your willingness to consider my feelings in this. John will do you (and me) proud. 


Nora Williams 


P.S. If for any reason (and I can't imagine one), you find yourself unable to appoint Mr. Verdon, I would beg you to talk with me before you make an alternate appointment. There are two reasons for this: (1) I hope that you would never wish to replace me under these circumstances with someone who opposed my work while I held office and (2) I know that you care as much as I do about continuing our work with the state on water quality and other issues, priorities not shared by all of the emerging field, You may reach me at any time via cell phone at 305-393-1666 if you need to discuss. Wishing you all the best, as always, Nora.

Governor,

This afternoon I announced in the press that, due to health issues, I will be stepping down from my County Commission post as of the 18th of this month. I have discussed it at some length with Colleen Castille, who has been a terrific comfort to me in a difficult time. I have had diabetes for over 34 years (jeepers, doesn't that make me sound OLD?), and, due to some complications with my insulin pump and resistance to insulin, I am having a tough time regaining blood sugar stability. It's going to take more work and more concentration than I can give it as a County Commissioner.

Please accept my heartfelt apology for not finishing my term. While I have no doubt that I am right to step down (and my mother has promised to smack me silly if I don't), I find today, having made the announcement, that it is nonetheless breaking my heart not to finish my term. And I have every hope and plan to get this problem under control and get back in fighting shape, so to speak. I thank you for all the support and kindness you have shown me over my years on the Commission and I hope you know how much I support you - and how much I think of you.

I will be wishing you all the best. 

Sincerely,

Nora Williams

P. S. After the Escambia County interlude, I feel like this is pretty small news on your front, and I do prefer my reason for leaving office by a long shot. Take care!

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I was disappointed to read in the Friday, May 11 Palm Beach Post that various legislators have succeeded in getting "line item turkeys" into the budget. It appears that for the fourteenth time in sixteen years, rates paid to Seagull Industries by the State for programs for mentally retarded and developmentally challenged adults will be frozen. So, taking large sums of money that could go to lots of non-profits who have been deprived of adequate funding over the years and giving it to a few organizations who have political clout is very simply VERY POOR PRIORITIZATION. I support your vetoing every one of the turkeys throughout Florida this year. If there are no funds in the budget for rate increases after all these years of freezes, there should not be one cent for a turkey. I have nothing against the turkey concept when there are funds for programs and services that have been doing good in their communities for many years. However, not this year! Thank you for your consideration in this matter.

Thank you for writing. First and foremost, I don't believe we should
abolish
the career civil service system. I agree with you that we should strive
to
improve it. What suggestions would you make?
I understand that there is confusion about our efforts. Part of that
confusion is my fault and part is being spread by folks who want no
changes
at all. That is why we are having town hall meetings, email exchanges,
meetings with workers all across the state. We are receiving many good
suggestions on how to improve the system to allow for state workers to
be
rewarded adequately for hard and effective work.
I really appreciate your taking the time to write.
Jeb Bush

Governor Bush:

I am a career service employee and believe that the system can be
improved,
not abolished. I am old enough to remember the patronage system prior to
1958 and the "bag" men who collected tribute from appointed employees on
pay
day. I am not even remotely suggesting that we would return to that day,
but
the patronage pressure would nonetheless be present. Every four years
the
patronage train arrived in Tallahassee and off loaded political
gadflies,
pork choppers and worse. Gov. Collins saw the necessity for a
professional
cadre of employees who retained institutional knowledge of government
and
overlapped the election of new governors, and now, the election of a new
political party... my party, I may add. Perhaps that cadre will shrink
without sacrificing initiative, loyalty and institutional knowledge.

There are premises that are not scientifically supported by the 100
business
leaders advocating this initiative. One, that the state will attract
better
employees, two, that the "team" concept will be engendered and three,
that a
leaner meaner government will be more efficient and cheaper to run. None
of
these concepts have a basis in the private sector, as I have spent most
of
my adult life just trying to make a payroll. The private sector is
revenue
driven; the public sector, service driven. The human resource theories
are
not coterminous. When revenue is low, people are laid off; when
management
is bad, the workers, not the management are let go. That is capitalism
and
the essence of American business, as cold as it may sound. Your office
is
looking to cut positions and then, only the least costly positions --
the
entry level jobs that lead up the ladder are the ones being cut. My
position
was cut in your current initiative, not because the position was not
needed,
but that it would impact the agency the least in terms of cost. Now, I
have
great leadership and was able to find a suitable position, but the
uncertainty of 6 months of waiting for the axe has a general negative
affect
on the people involved, their families and friends as well as the
over-all
morale of indirectly affected employees who say, "maybe I'm next." THIS
IS
JUST YEAR ONE.

I said earlier that career service could be improved. Its going to take
some
hard work and great cooperation. Governor, you are going to have to sit
down
with your employees, open the door to your office and let groups of
10-15 in
for 10 minutes at a time. You will get some truths. I have seen you
change
positions on other initiatives because you know and respect the power of
dissent. You are not going to see a ground swell of objection from
either
the public, the legislature or even the public employees themselves.
Only
those whose jobs on the line will dissent and in numbers too few to make
a
significant political impact. I have worked for and known many
Governors; my
wife has met and been pictured with all but you, sir, in her 32 years of
service to the State of Florida. Your office is the most important of
all.
If the troops do not truly feel the General supports them unequivocally,
not
merely by words, but by action, then the army flounders. Governor your
army
is floundering, not by your direct actions but by the uncertainty of the
process. I hear discussion that the current initiative is mean-spirited,
calculated to rid the state of poor employees -- the baby will also be
thrown out with the bath water. Your initiative will have little impact
on
the worst employees as the cream always comes to the top, the best are
over-worked as the worst are equally over-looked, not replaced. That is
human nature and applies to the private as well as public sectors.

Governor, I hear in the halls that you are losing the average state
employee's confidence, not the best and brightest and not the worst of
us. I
hear you are losing the rank and file, the employees that make this
state
go, the ones you want to reward with patronage bonus's instead of
across-the-board raises. Bonuses, promotions and raises are now based on
politics and friendships, not merit. There is nothing that can be
written
into law that will change that. Can you image not getting even a cost of
living increase because your supervisor doesn't think you merit it?

Government serves more people with a reduced workforce and yet each year
the
legislature passes new initiatives with less money for more work. Career
Service was created not to prevent government from doing its job but to
assure that it would have qualified technocrats to do the day-to-day
work
regardless of who was in office. That theory has not been lost, it has
just
been translated into 21st Century terms. Governor, please fix the career
service system without replacing it with a new and untested theory, a
theory
I may add , was tested until 1958 and left wanting.

My wife and I have over 40 years combined service in state government
and my
wife is in the drop program. Your changes will probably not affect us
directly so I speak for the 23 year olds that hope to make a career in
state
government. Give them job protection where it is warranted, a living
wage
and adequate benefits to retain them, training and experience to elevate
them, and leadership perceived to be in their best interests, to
motivate
them. Then you will have a lean government machine that will provide
good
public (not private) service at a reasonable cost to the taxpayers. Your
loyal employee.

Dear Ms. Kasriel:

	I am in receipt of the CMS response. On behalf of SAC, and our Chairperson,
Ms. Betty Busbee,  I thank you and Mr. Tomlinson for your prompt attention
to this matter. I also personally thank both you and Mr. Tomlinson as well
as Director Scully for CMS's support of the SAC mission. I am confident that
Governor Bush will be pleased to hear that state government, in this
instance being AHCA and SAC, were able to move forward in safeguarding
Florida's efforts to provide health and human services responsibly to the
beneficiaries of the Medicaid Program, because of CMS's endeavors.

	Again, for the record, it was General Counsel for the Dept. of Children &
Families ("DCF") who had opined to our SAC staff, who are DCF employees,
that SAC officials could never have access to Medicaid beneficiary
information, despite the Governor's signature on the bill passed by the
Florida Legislature in 2000 that intended to give SAC strong oversight
responsibility over the Medicaid Program, which caused me, as a healthcare
attorney, to seek out your assistance because I became concerned about
AHCA's ability to continue to cooperate with our state agency, as AHCA has
partnered with SAC in helping us advocate and protect Floridians with unique
needs.

	By way of this e-mail, SAC and I also thank AHCA Chief Medicaid Counsel,
Steven Grigass,  the State's Medicaid Program Director, Bob Sharpe, and of
course, AHCA Secretary Dr. Meadows for their continued assistance, kind
words, and support of the SAC mission.

Jeb, I have been thinking about you alot this week... I know you are glad to get the special session over with. Congratulations on getting the education bill and cabinet reorg through. Cabinet reorg was a big win. Sometimes, I wonder why we make it so hard on ourselves. 

My heart goes out to you and the foster care system families. I know how hard you have worked to improve the system. It seems we make two steps forward and one step back. Nevertheless, progress is made and we must not give up. 

Here is my idea: Appoint Carl Weinrich or Chris Card to oversee the Department and charge them to replicate the Sarasota Model across the state. I am on the YMCA board here in Sarasota and have watched first hand the success of the privatization program. I have immense respect for Carl and the work his team has done to improve the foster care system. Let me know if I can help.

Dear Governor Bush,

In September,2001, I had a pancreas transplant in conjunction with Lifelink Transplant Institute (Tampa) and Tampa General Hospital due to complications from diabetes.  In 1994, I also had a kidney transplant due to the same reason.  I was referred for a pancreas transplant in order to slow or stop complications and to prolong my life.  My husband died unexpectedly the year before leaving me with a 4-year-old son adopted from the state.  Lifelink took full responsibility in obtaining approvals from both my primary insurance through All Children's (self-insured) and my secondary insurance (BCBS) prior to placing me on the transplant list.  The transplant has been a great success.  I've since been notified that my primary insurance has denied based on need for a second opinion.  Therefore, my secondary insurance has also denied.  At no time, prior to transplant was I notified by my employer, insurance company or Lifelink that there were any outstanding issues to address.  I've filed an appeal to All Children's regarding this matter but feel that if they were going to do the right thing that it would have happened by now.  I have been an employee in good standing for 9 years.  

In the past, I know you have been concerned about individual as well as state issues. I would appreciate any help you can give me regarding this looming financial matter.  This is affecting my health and well-being and that of my child.

Hon. Jeb Bush
Governor of Florida
The Capitol
Tallahassee, FL 32399

The President of the Andalucía Group, one of the 17 autonomous
communities
of Spain, Don Manuel Chávez, will make an official visit to Florida on
July
8-10 of this year.  The purpose of this journey is, essentially, to
promote
ties between Florida and Andalucía and, more specifically, to encourage
economic and commercial exchange between the two regions.

Mr. Chávez would be very pleased if he could have a brief visit with
you,
and consequently, I would be very appreciative, if your schedule
permits, if
you could receive Mr. Chávez in your office at some moment during the
aforementioned dates.  I will accompany the President on this visit.  

Thanking you in advance for any attention that you could lend to my
request,
I send cordial greetings with great affection,


Javier Vallaure

Subject:	Miami-Dade County on the go...

Greetings, and I hope this email finds you well. Much has been going on in your county government over the last few weeks. We have overcome some technical difficulties with our email distribution list and I am glad to be able to send you this latest update via email. I am also very pleased at the response I am getting to our virtual open door policy. The emailed suggestions and concerns I am receiving from many of you really help to improve our organization - your government. Keep those emails coming....

This week, we released our second edition of the County Citizen: <http://www.miamidade.gov/countycitizen/> This publication, also produced in print for those without Internet access, is designed to publish the good works our 30,000 county employees do each and every day. We're good neighbors, doing good things for the community - our community and yours. I invite you to get to know us a bit better by reading the County Citizen. 

As part of our good citizenship, I encourage people to send us information about the things you may see in the community that need to be fixed. Through our Eyes at Miami-Dade program, I invite anyone to email us reports of things like downed stop signs or other potentially hazardous situations so that the county can proactively address these things. This is just part of working together to make our community as safe as possible for everyone. If you see something that's not right, please email your concern to eyes@miamidade.gov <mailto:eyes@miamidade.gov> .

 

Getting out of our offices and into the community is a big part of improving service to the public. The most recent addition to our fleet of mobile services, the Government on the Go bus, will be hitting the streets in the coming months, bringing county services right into your neighborhood. Staffed by Team Metro personnel, the bus will travel to places where people frequently gather such as, grocery stores, parks, shopping centers or special events. Services available include job information, voter registration, baby stroller permits, passports, dog license tags, Metropasses and tokens and Bike & Ride Permits. Eventually, the bus will offer services like Golden Passports (transportation for seniors), alarm registration, Homestead Exemption and more. Already, we are out in the community with two of our new Bookmobiles <http://www.mdpls.org/news/press/pr/41502bm_launch.htm> and the Mobile Animal Clinic <http://www.co.miami-dade.fl.us/animals/mac_schedule.htm>. And of course, we are available to the public 24 hours a day, 7 days a week via the Internet. Internet access is free to the public in all branches of our library system. It's all about getting closer to the people we serve, and making our services accessible and easy to use.

According to the Sloan Management Review "The rate at which organizations learn may become the only sustainable source of competitive advantage." While one may not associate the term 'competitive advantage' with the public sector, I firmly believe that governments must gain the same level of efficiency that drive private sector organizations to compete. We simply must be compelled to do more for the public with less resource. Along these lines, education in county government remains a top priority for me, and I am pleased to report continued progress in our partnership with Florida International University. Continuous learning is essential, and through these types of partnerships we are now offering educational opportunities for our employees ranging from high school equivalency, undergraduate and graduate programs, as well as certifications. More information on our training initiatives can be found online at: <http://www.co.miami-dade.fl.us/emprel/training.htm> 

It's just over a year now that I was given the opportunity to serve you as the Manager of Miami-Dade County. I believe that together we have made a good deal of progress and I look forward to working with you to overcome the challenges we face and embrace the opportunities we have to make this community the best ever. Again, please feel free to email or call any time.... 

Regards,
Steve Shiver

Re: Request For Support of the Governor's Veto of HB 1307

Dear Colleague:

On May 2, six PVA members, including myself, met in the Governor's media room 
at the Tallahassee Statehouse to discuss Florida HB 1307, which is basically 
a good bill.  The problem is that it is a 52 page Florida Building Code bill, 
which contains four lines of language that would reduce accessibility into 
"places of public accommodation." It will accomplish this because less 
stringent Federal language from the Americans with Disabilities Act (The ADA) 
of 1990 was inserted into this bill in the form of an amendment.  Included in 
this meeting from the Governor's staff were:

* Alan Flores, Deputy Chief for Legislative Affairs (850-488-5000)
* Kevin Tang, Assistant General Counsel for Governor Bush (850-488-3494)
* Barbara Hoagland, Governor's Correspondence Liaison (850-487-1884)
* Julie Shaw, Executive Director, Administrator, Governor's ADA Working Group 
(850-487-3423)

* For the DCA: Jim Richmond, Assistant General Counsel (850-488-0410)

Shortly after this one + hour long discussion began, it became clear that 
neither Messrs. Flores nor Tang understood the concept of the Code of Federal 
Regulations 28 CFR Part 36.403 (f)(1) "20% Disproportionality" language, and 
they did not understand how introducing it into Florida statutes would 
negatively effect people with disabilities. They also heard our opposition to 
allowing private non-certified inspectors perform inspections on new 
construction. They listened, and I think we got through to them. Jim Richmond 
from the DCA supported our position. Now begs the question, what is the 
Governor going to do? We have requested an ASAP face-to-face meeting with the 
Governor on this issue.

This is the language we are opposed to:


SENATE AMENDMENT - - Bill No. CS for CS for SBA 2078

Amendment No. ___ Barcode 483402

18 the Accessibility Advisory Council. Notwithstanding any other

19 provision of this subsection, if an applicant for a waiver

20 demonstrates economic hardship in accordance with 28 C.F.R.

21 36.403(f)(1), a waiver shall be granted. The commission may - - -

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Note: The operative word in the above sentence is: "SHALL."

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Not only do we oppose this amendment, but we object to the manner that this 
amendment was slipped into the existing bill at the eleventh hour. The 
Amendment was introduced on March 13th, and the bill was signed by the House 
on the 20th and by the Senate on the 22nd. Persons with disabilities who will 
be affected by this amendment were not informed and were not given an 
opportunity to voice their opinions or opposition. This amendment should have 
been placed on the agenda of the Accessibility Advisory TAC (Technical 
Advisory Committee) of the Florida Building Commission. Advocates would have 
appreciated it if they had been notified in advance through the Governor's 
ADA Working Group. 

Chapter 28 of the US Code of Regulations (CFR) reads:

"28 C.F.R. 36.403(f)(1) Disproportionality. Alterations made to provide an 
accessible * path of travel to the altered area will be deemed 
disproportionate to the overall alteration where the cost exceeds 20% of the 
cost of the alteration to the primary function area."

( * Definition, Path of Travel: " - - - the continuous, unobstructed way of 
pedestrian passage by means of which the altered area may be approached, 
entered and exited and which connects the altered area with an exterior 
approach." Florida's Vertical Accessibility is part of the "Path of Travel.")

In other words, if this bill is signed, in the future, when building owners 
apply for waivers from vertical accessibility, if their cost of providing 
vertical accessibility to the altered portion of the building exceeds 20% of 
the cost of the alteration, the project is AUTOMATICALLY EXEMPTED (per the 
operative word, "shall") from providing vertical access to the newly altered 
area. 

This would effectively nullify our Florida vertical accessibility statute FS 
553.509, which states: 

"Florida State Statute 553.509: Vertical accessibility.--Nothing in sections 
553.501-553.513 or the guidelines shall be construed to relieve the owner of 
any building, structure, or facility governed by those sections from the duty 
to provide vertical accessibility to all levels above and below the 
occupiable grade level, regardless of whether the guidelines require an 
elevator to be installed in such building, structure, or facility - - -"

(The entire wording of this statute is included at the end of this 
communication.)

Under current Florida statutes, when a building owner makes alterations to an 
existing facility, the owner is obliged to include the costs of providing 
vertical accessibility. This means installing an elevator, ramp, wheelchair 
stairglide, or some other limited use lift device. He would also be required 
to make "Path of Travel" accessibility improvements. However, the system 
currently allows for a "Hardship Waiver." If providing vertical accessibility 
will cause an economic hardship, or if providing vertical accessibility is 
deemed by an architect or an engineer to be "technically infeasible," these 
are grounds for a hardship waiver to be granted. 

If the building owner appears before the Florida Building Commission and 
proves economic hardship, the waiver may be approved or deferred until some 
agreed-upon time in the future when the accessibility modification shall be 
completed. Or, if a hardship is not proven, the waiver may be denied. 

Example #1:
A building owner, under current statutes, is required to provide vertical 
accessibility when he performs a construction alteration. He applies for a 
building permit to do a $100,000 renovation. The owner estimates the costs of 
providing vertical accessibility at $30,000. He feels that this is too 
expensive and will be an economic hardship. If the owner does not meet one of 
the current statutory exemptions, the local code official is required to 
refer the owner to the Accessibility Advisory Committee of the Florida 
Building Commission to apply for a hardship waiver. 

Under the current Florida statutes, there is no 20% language. The seven 
member Accessibility Advisory Council, known as the "Waiver Board," will hear 
the applicant's petition for a waiver. The Board may grant or deny the 
request, based on the applicant's testimony. The Board may also grant a 
waiver for a limited period of time. This is something that is not done under 
the Federal regulation 28 CFR 36.

Example #2:
HB 1307 is signed by the Governor, and the same building owner applies for a 
building permit to do the same $100,000 renovation and gets referred to the 
Building Commission for a waiver. With the 20% language, in this example the 
maximum amount the owner would have to spend for both path of travel and 
vertical accessibility would be $20,000. 

Remember, the operative word in the amendment to HB 1307 is "SHALL. " If the 
cost exceeds 20%, a waiver SHALL be granted. 

In the second example, the owner applies for a waiver from providing vertical 
accessibility and attends his hearing at the monthly meeting of the Florida 
Building Commission's "Waiver Board." He presents estimates for $20,000 worth 
of accessibility work that will come under the "Path of Travel" guidelines. 
These costs are for Accessible Parking, Entrances, Bathrooms, etc.. He also 
has an estimate for an additional $30,000 for a lift device to provide 
vertical accessibility, for which he wants a waiver. 

In the second example, the owner is automatically granted his waiver to 
provide vertical accessibility in his facility because the $30,000 exceeds 
the 20% ceiling. In the first example, the waiver may be granted, denied, 
deferred to a future meeting, or conditionally granted. Quite a few 
applicants have received "conditional waivers" when they have agreed to 
achieve vertical accessibility in their facilities after an extended period 
of time. This allows them to accumulate the funds necessary to fund the 
alteration. If HB 1307 is signed, the Waiver Board will not be allowed to 
explore the possibility of a conditional waiver.

Under the 20% disproportionality, future applicants will have the opportunity 
to avoid providing vertical accessibility by spending more money than 
necessary on "Path of Travel" improvements. This will get them to the 20% 
ceiling, and thus, qualify them for their waiver. 

NOTE: Applicants who are refused a waiver by the seven member "Waiver Board" 
may reapply to the full 23 member Florida Building Commission. The Florida 
Building Commission hears waiver reviews within one day of the seven member 
"Waiver Board" hearing. Authorized by FS 553.74(1)(m), the Florida Building 
Commission includes: "One member of a Florida-based organization of persons 
with disabilities or a nationally chartered organization of persons with 
disabilities with chapters in this state." ( See the compete statute at the 
end of this communication.)

If the ADA language in the Federal 28 C. F. R. 36.403(f)(1) becomes the law 
of the land in Florida, we can expect to see fewer and fewer existing 
buildings become accessible in the future. When building owners make 
improvements to their property, they will have no incentive to try to include 
accessibility. To save money, they will take advantage of the "20% 
Disproportionality Exemption" afforded them in this amendment to HB 1307. 
Building owners will have an easy selection from two choices of options: 

1) Do I want to spend less money and not make my business accessible, or
2) Do I want to spend more money and make my place accessible.

To repeat what I mentioned earlier in this communication: This amendment 
would effectively nullify our Florida vertical accessibility statute FS 
553.509. The "Waiver Board" would be a rubber stamp for granting waivers from 
vertical accessibility. The insertion of the 28 CFR 36 20% language will 
clash and create a glich with our current FS 553.509: Vertical 
accessibility.--Nothing in sections 553.501-553.513 or the guidelines shall 
be construed to relieve the owner of any building, structure, or facility 
governed by those sections from the duty to provide vertical accessibility - 
- - . 

If the Governor signs HB 1307, he will be promoting INACCESSIBILITY in 
Florida. Additionally, there is a clause the Federal ADA that disallows a 
facility, or a state, 
to decrease existing accessibility. HB 1307 would achieve that undesirable 
affect in Florida and could trigger an investigation by the US Department of 
Justice. 

Here is another very important reason for vetoing this bill: This bill 
contains language that would lower the standards for building inspections 
around the state. This bill creates a class of new inspectors from the 
private sector who will not have to maintain or possess the same level of 
standards possessed by state-certified inspectors. This could lead to unsafe 
new structures because these inspectors may show loyalty to the person who 
hires and pays them and "overlook" items in favor of their employer.

I would very much appreciate any help or advice that you could give to us. We 
believe that the current "waiver process" is sufficient to satisfy the needs 
of both owners of buildings and persons with disabilities. Please help us 
protect the rights and privileges afforded to Floridians for which 
individuals with disabilities have worked so hard to obtain. We need to make 
every effort to ensure that the Governor will veto this devastating piece of 
legislation.

Please contact the Governors office and persuade him to veto this critical 
bill. Please call, write, email and/or fax your concerns about this bill.

Dear Sir:

In 1986 I spent a year serving the State of Florida as a Correctional 
Probation Officer  after which time I left the dept to attend law 
school....then I dropped out to become a teacher, my current occupation.  
After an examination of the statute, I see that probation officers are indeed 
classified as law enforcement officers and their addresses may NOT be 
released by the Dept of motor vehicles or their employers such as Miami-Dade 
County Public Schools unless the inquiry is made by a police agency.  This 
applies to all serving and FORMER officers.  

The reason I ask, sir, is that while I was a member of the dept I made 
several arrests and testified in serval more cases, and even received a death 
threat or two.  I'd like to verify that this shield law is still in effect 
and inquire as to how I can make the Dept of motor vehicles aware of my 
status (so they won't release sensitive info on me to just anybody) and that 
I might have something written on official letterhead to show my boss that he 
can't give my name and address info out to anybody either.

The last two and a half years have been spent visiting and ranking the sites that represent over 98% of the World Wide Web traffic (over eleven years of man-hours involved).
No one has even attempted to do this, the feeling being that the task was just too monumental.
Who would be the person(s) to present this to?
I haven’t had much luck in getting anyone to listen.

Dear Governor: 
This may have been considered, but I have a constructive suggestion -- it might be in the best interest of the child, and eliminate any appearance of conflict for DCF,  for DCF to seek appointment of both a Guardian ad litem and an attorney ad litem for Rilya.  I think it would be appropriate given that:   the status of Rilya's true next of kin are at issue; her mother's rights have been terminated; she is missing and may be dead, and there are legal issues pertaining to the openness of her files where it appears that DCF may have a conflict in decisionmaking, and other legal issues may arise.  
 
A guardian and attorney could relieve DCF of the appearance of any conflict and would protect the child's interests -- -- perhaps a former judge, or former prosecutor who has handled children's issues?

Subject:	RE: Rilya Wilson

Jonas, you are right that family breakdown is the cause of the need for a government run child welfare system that can't replace loving wholesome families. I say that everytime I speak about this case. Your number on 25% of the children being out of wedlock is sadly low. The number is about 33%. 

Having said that, the negligence in handling this case is cause for concern and we have a responsibility to improve the system until their is a societal change that lessens the demands placed on government. 

Thank you for writing.

Subject: Rilya Wilson


Hello Governor:

I think that you should be brave in terms of politics and public policy regarding Rilya Wilson and tell the truth. Little Ms. Wilson did not go missing because of your "failure to adequately fund social services" (although I do feel that you need to spend more money in that area as well as transportation and even more so in education ... if that isn't the role of government what is?) 

No, Rilya Wilson is missing solely because her guardian handed her to a stranger. Whatever her fate is, it was for all intents and purposes sealed when that was done, even had the police been called immediately (which they were not). You can make that statement clearly and without demonizing her guardian.

Why did Rilya Wilson go missing for so long? It is true that there was negligence in this case, but the true reason is because DFACS is overburdened. Why is DFACS overburdened? Again, not because of your "neglect" of social programs or "failed state bureaucracy, but because there are so many children in its care. Why are there so many children in its care? Because of family breakdown. Drugs, AIDS, crime/incarceration, unemployment, etc. compound the problem, as does poor educational systems. They should be referenced as causes contributing to the problem and be addressed.

But the primary cause of this overwhelming of state resources with hundreds of thousands of children is the culture of so many people having children for which they have no capacity of ever supporting, specifically teenage pregnancy, men who abandon their children and women having children out of wedlock. I would wager large sums of money that the vast majority of children under the care of DFACS and the state's many other noneducational social welfare programs (as well as those in the juvenile crime system) are products of this culture. 

In a state of 16 million people, there is no way DFACS can effectively do its job if 1/ 4 of children are born out of wedlock, and if 2/3rds or more are born out of wedlock in minority and urban communities. No government bureaucracy could ever be constructed to correct such massive personal failures. You must stand up and say that the reckless having of children (and engaging in the behavior that creates children) by selfish irresponsible people is not a lifestyle choice but a cancer on society, and it takes away resources spent vainly trying to deal with the problems that it creates from problems that are more tractable. Imagine how many more teachers that Florida could hire or how much more money could be spent on transportation projects if Florida did not have to spend billions to care for children created by absentee, irresponsible, and teen (and increasingly preteen) parents.

If you fail to show courage by taking on the real underlying root issues that led to this tragedy in public speeches and public policy, it would be a failure of leadership. You have to do it not because of politics but rather because no one else will. Thank you.

Jonas Walton

Subject: RE: North Broward Hospital District appointment


Jeb:
 
Thanks for asking for my input.  Before I begin to give the answers to your questions, I caution you not to read the responses believing that any monies we receive will not be appreciated. In fact, they will!   I am not one for looking a gift horse in the mouth!  However, the percentages being tossed around can be deceiving when disaggregated---that is what I will candidly relay to you.
 
1)       Overall Funding Increases:
I           If the State legislature adopts the budget as proposed, Broward County School District will receive a budget increase of     approximately $132M.  This is a 10% increase in overall funding from the mid-year cuts. If applied to the beginning of this school’s fiscal year, it amounts to an increase of 7%!  
 
 
2)       Growth Factor:
      There is a 4% increase in student growth anticipated.  It has been calculated into the 7% and/or 10% figures 
mentioned above.  Therefore, in reality, the school district will realize no more than 3% and/or 6% increase!  
 
 
3)       Insurance Premium Hit:
ALL school district will experience substantial increases in insurance costs next year.  Broward expects an 
increase of $20M!  
 
 
4)       Programs, adjustments and creative financing:
At the beginning of last year’s budget process, we cut 2 ½ % from each school site.  Principals where told not to cut 
from their staff but to look closely at the “fluff and stuff”.  Central administration (all departments) where cut by 10%.  At the mid-year cut, central admin put a freeze on hiring; we did not take any monies from classrooms.   In addition, we leveraged additional funds from a lease-purchase program for computer equipment, trucks and school buses. 
 
 
5)       Per Student Funding:
Indeed, we would receive a 6% increase per student, if the legislature adopts the proposed budget.  Once again, if the 
increase is calculated from the beginning of last year, that increase would only be a 3% increase per student. 
 
 
6)       TRUE BOTTOM LINE:
Calculating the proposed budget on the mid-year budget with the new insurance rates and growth factor = 1.5% increase
which would go directly to salary increases!  (It doesn’t even cover the cost of living increase!  :-( )
            Calculating the proposed budget on the beginning of the fiscal year with the new insurance rates and growth factor = 3% which would go directly to salary increases!  
            Broward is fortunate in that we made our cuts last year; therefore, this year will not be as draconian!  If we hadn’t, not only would we realize no TRUE increase, we would be further behind!  We are in better shape than a lot of other districts from what I am hearing.  
 
 
Once again, Jeb, this email is NOT covered with tears…just some blood and sweat!  (I loved that rock band of the 60’s!)  I caution your staff or the legislatures in approaching the proposed budget increase as “victorious” because in reality it truly is not.  I realize that without your persuasion we would not even be looking at a possible 1 ½% or 3% increase.  To that extent, I sincerely appreciate your efforts!
 
Good luck.  Contact me if you have other thoughts,

Governor Jeb Bush

Tallahassee, FL

Dear Governor Bush,

As secretary of the organization WHOA (Waterfront Home Owner's Assembly), I am writing you in reference to an e-mail you received from Stu Barnette concerning the treatment of invasive weed growth in Lake Rousseau. Stu Barnette is a respected member of our organization but the referenced letter represents Stu Barnette's personal views and does not reflect the sentiment of the association. Although it is true we are dissatisfied with the present situation and would like to have an alternate method of weed control, we have yet to be presented with a viable alternative. We have faith in the local representatives of the DEP and feel they are concerned and doing their best with the only method available. 

Our organization is dedicated to preserve, protect and perhaps restore, (if it is not already too late), one of the state's greatest treasures, the Withlacoochee River and Lake Rousseau. We feel that there must be some alternative to the self defeating methods we are now implementing. The spraying of these weeds is not very effective and produces a muck that settles to the bottom causing premature silting of this beautiful lake. It is in fact better than nothing, but we urge you to look into this problem, not from a local level, but encourage you to press any agency that you command into service. It is not just a local problem, but affects nearly every waterway in Florida. 

We are one of several organizations formed with similar goals. It is time for our officials to get on the band wagon and look for a solution to our deteriorating water resources. 

Respectfully, 

Sandra Clodwick, President and Ron Johnson, Secretary

WHOA (Waterfront Home Owner's Assembly)

Dear Governor, 

This week at the initial Citizen Corps meeting held by Mayor Hood I had the opportunity to meet your Special Assistant, Waldemar Serrano.  In speaking with him I talked about the opportunity that you have to use AM580 WDBO as often as you wish to help Central Floridians understand the important issues facing the state.  The opportunity is more than just a news interview, rather I would suggest a four or five minute segment in morning drive with our host Jim Turner.  This way you can explain the issues as you want people to understand them, not just get a 5 to 10 second sound bite.  Prior to the election season heating up it seems to me that this is a great opportunity for you to lay out the issues that will affect the way people vote.

AM580 WDBO is the dominant News/Talk radio station in Central Florida and has been for many years.  Listeners to our station are active voters.  Mayor Hood,  Orange County Chairman Crotty, Congressman Ric Keller, Florida House Speaker Tom Feeney and other politicians understand this and take full advantage of WDBO to keep our community up to date on matters of importance.  It is a safe environment for a political figure to talk and be respected.  I encourage you to talk with any of them about how they work with WDBO. If you would like to call me and get a better understanding of what we can do I would love to explain it to you personally.  My direct line is 321-281-2013.

Governor, you are going to spend millions of dollars for 60 second commercials once the campaign really kicks in to get your message across.  So will many others.  There is a great opportunity now to clearly lay out the issues for a huge block of Central Florida voters.  And should you win re-election (sorry, I'll vote for you and think that you will win, but can't be completely presumptive about it) WDBO gives you a way to keep the issues alive and move voters to influence their Senators and Representatives on these issues.  

I hope that we get the opportunity to work together to help the State of Florida.

Dear Governor Bush,

My name is Mark Strickland. I spoke with you at your citizen day on December 14, 2001 in Flagler County.  We spoke at length about the ten-acre issue that we have been dealing with in our county and the problems we have been having with our local government and also DCA.
I have spoken today with McKay Jimeson about scheduling a meeting with you, and have been told that it would take approximately two weeks to get an appointment with you.  Because of  several issues that have recently come about concerning our County Commissioners, it is of great importance that I meet with you as soon as possible. There are a number of events that have just occurred in our county where it appears that a breaking of the Sunshine Law, and possibly other discrimination issues, have occurred.
I would appreciate meeting with you as soon as possible.  There are three or four others who have been involved in this situation from the beginning that I would like to have meet with us also, with your permission.  I look forward to seeing you soon.

Sincerely,
Mark Strickland

Re: Request For Support of the Governor's Veto of HB 1307 

Dear Colleague: 

On May 2, six PVA members, including myself, met in the Governor's media 
room 
at the Tallahassee Statehouse to discuss Florida HB 1307, which is 
basically 
a good bill.  The problem is that it is a 52 page Florida Building Code 
bill, 
which contains four lines of language that would reduce accessibility 
into 
"places of public accommodation." It will accomplish this because less 
stringent Federal language from the Americans with Disabilities Act (The 
ADA) 
of 1990 was inserted into this bill in the form of an amendment. 
Included in 
this meeting from the Governor's staff were: 

* Alan Flores, Deputy Chief for Legislative Affairs (850-488-5000) 
* Kevin Tang, Assistant General Counsel for Governor Bush (850-488-3494) 
* Barbara Hoagland, Governor's Correspondence Liaison (850-487-1884) 
* Julie Shaw, Executive Director, Administrator, Governor's ADA Working 
Group 
(850-487-3423) 

* For the DCA: Jim Richmond, Assistant General Counsel (850-488-0410) 

Shortly after this one + hour long discussion began, it became clear 
that 
neither Messrs. Flores nor Tang understood the concept of the Code of 
Federal 
Regulations 28 CFR Part 36.403 (f)(1) "20% Disproportionality" language, 
and 
they did not understand how introducing it into Florida statutes would 
negatively effect people with disabilities. They also heard our 
opposition to 
allowing private non-certified inspectors perform inspections on new 
construction. They listened, and I think we got through to them. Jim 
Richmond 
from the DCA supported our position. Now begs the question, what is the 
Governor going to do? We have requested an ASAP face-to-face meeting 
with the 
Governor on this issue. 

This is the language we are opposed to: 


SENATE AMENDMENT - - Bill No. CS for CS for SBA 2078 

Amendment No. ___ Barcode 483402 

18 the Accessibility Advisory Council. Notwithstanding any other 

19 provision of this subsection, if an applicant for a waiver 

20 demonstrates economic hardship in accordance with 28 C.F.R. 

21 36.403(f)(1), a waiver shall be granted. The commission may - - - 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
^^^^^^ 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

Note: The operative word in the above sentence is: "SHALL." 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
^^^^^^ 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

Not only do we oppose this amendment, but we object to the manner that 
this 
amendment was slipped into the existing bill at the eleventh hour. The 
Amendment was introduced on March 13th, and the bill was signed by the 
House 
on the 20th and by the Senate on the 22nd. Persons with disabilities who 
will 
be affected by this amendment were not informed and were not given an 
opportunity to voice their opinions or opposition. This amendment should 
have 
been placed on the agenda of the Accessibility Advisory TAC (Technical 
Advisory Committee) of the Florida Building Commission. Advocates would 
have 
appreciated it if they had been notified in advance through the 
Governor's 
ADA Working Group. 

Chapter 28 of the US Code of Regulations (CFR) reads: 

"28 C.F.R. 36.403(f)(1) Disproportionality. Alterations made to provide 
an 
accessible * path of travel to the altered area will be deemed 
disproportionate to the overall alteration where the cost exceeds 20% of 
the 
cost of the alteration to the primary function area." 

( * Definition, Path of Travel: " - - - the continuous, unobstructed way 
of 
pedestrian passage by means of which the altered area may be approached, 

entered and exited and which connects the altered area with an exterior 
approach." Florida's Vertical Accessibility is part of the "Path of 
Travel.") 

In other words, if this bill is signed, in the future, when building 
owners 
apply for waivers from vertical accessibility, if their cost of 
providing 
vertical accessibility to the altered portion of the building exceeds 
20% of 
the cost of the alteration, the project is AUTOMATICALLY EXEMPTED (per 
the 
operative word, "shall") from providing vertical access to the newly 
altered 
area. 

This would effectively nullify our Florida vertical accessibility 
statute FS 
553.509, which states: 

"Florida State Statute 553.509: Vertical accessibility.--Nothing in 
sections 
553.501-553.513 or the guidelines shall be construed to relieve the 
owner of 
any building, structure, or facility governed by those sections from the 
duty 
to provide vertical accessibility to all levels above and below the 
occupiable grade level, regardless of whether the guidelines require an 
elevator to be installed in such building, structure, or facility - - -" 

(The entire wording of this statute is included at the end of this 
communication.) 

Under current Florida statutes, when a building owner makes alterations 
to an 
existing facility, the owner is obliged to include the costs of 
providing 
vertical accessibility. This means installing an elevator, ramp, 
wheelchair 
stairglide, or some other limited use lift device. He would also be 
required 
to make "Path of Travel" accessibility improvements. However, the system 

currently allows for a "Hardship Waiver." If providing vertical 
accessibility 
will cause an economic hardship, or if providing vertical accessibility 
is 
deemed by an architect or an engineer to be "technically infeasible," 
these 
are grounds for a hardship waiver to be granted. 

If the building owner appears before the Florida Building Commission and 

proves economic hardship, the waiver may be approved or deferred until 
some 
agreed-upon time in the future when the accessibility modification shall 
be 
completed. Or, if a hardship is not proven, the waiver may be denied. 

Example #1: 
A building owner, under current statutes, is required to provide 
vertical 
accessibility when he performs a construction alteration. He applies for 
a 
building permit to do a $100,000 renovation. The owner estimates the 
costs of 
providing vertical accessibility at $30,000. He feels that this is too 
expensive and will be an economic hardship. If the owner does not meet 
one of 
the current statutory exemptions, the local code official is required to 

refer the owner to the Accessibility Advisory Committee of the Florida 
Building Commission to apply for a hardship waiver. 

Under the current Florida statutes, there is no 20% language. The seven 
member Accessibility Advisory Council, known as the "Waiver Board," will 
hear 
the applicant's petition for a waiver. The Board may grant or deny the 
request, based on the applicant's testimony. The Board may also grant a 
waiver for a limited period of time. This is something that is not done 
under 
the Federal regulation 28 CFR 36. 

Example #2: 
HB 1307 is signed by the Governor, and the same building owner applies 
for a 
building permit to do the same $100,000 renovation and gets referred to 
the 
Building Commission for a waiver. With the 20% language, in this example 
the 
maximum amount the owner would have to spend for both path of travel and 

vertical accessibility would be $20,000. 

Remember, the operative word in the amendment to HB 1307 is "SHALL. " If 
the 
cost exceeds 20%, a waiver SHALL be granted. 

In the second example, the owner applies for a waiver from providing 
vertical 
accessibility and attends his hearing at the monthly meeting of the 
Florida 
Building Commission's "Waiver Board." He presents estimates for $20,000 
worth 
of accessibility work that will come under the "Path of Travel" 
guidelines. 
These costs are for Accessible Parking, Entrances, Bathrooms, etc.. He 
also 
has an estimate for an additional $30,000 for a lift device to provide 
vertical accessibility, for which he wants a waiver. 

In the second example, the owner is automatically granted his waiver to 
provide vertical accessibility in his facility because the $30,000 
exceeds 
the 20% ceiling. In the first example, the waiver may be granted, 
denied, 
deferred to a future meeting, or conditionally granted. Quite a few 
applicants have received "conditional waivers" when they have agreed to 
achieve vertical accessibility in their facilities after an extended 
period 
of time. This allows them to accumulate the funds necessary to fund the 
alteration. If HB 1307 is signed, the Waiver Board will not be allowed 
to 
explore the possibility of a conditional waiver. 

Under the 20% disproportionality, future applicants will have the 
opportunity 
to avoid providing vertical accessibility by spending more money than 
necessary on "Path of Travel" improvements. This will get them to the 
20% 
ceiling, and thus, qualify them for their waiver. 

NOTE: Applicants who are refused a waiver by the seven member "Waiver 
Board" 
may reapply to the full 23 member Florida Building Commission. The 
Florida 
Building Commission hears waiver reviews within one day of the seven 
member 
"Waiver Board" hearing. Authorized by FS 553.74(1)(m), the Florida 
Building 
Commission includes: "One member of a Florida-based organization of 
persons 
with disabilities or a nationally chartered organization of persons with 

disabilities with chapters in this state." ( See the compete statute at 
the 
end of this communication.) 

If the ADA language in the Federal 28 C. F. R. 36.403(f)(1) becomes the 
law 
of the land in Florida, we can expect to see fewer and fewer existing 
buildings become accessible in the future. When building owners make 
improvements to their property, they will have no incentive to try to 
include 
accessibility. To save money, they will take advantage of the "20% 
Disproportionality Exemption" afforded them in this amendment to HB 
1307. 
Building owners will have an easy selection from two choices of options: 


1) Do I want to spend less money and not make my business accessible, or 
2) Do I want to spend more money and make my place accessible. 

To repeat what I mentioned earlier in this communication: This amendment 

would effectively nullify our Florida vertical accessibility statute FS 
553.509. The "Waiver Board" would be a rubber stamp for granting waivers 
from 
vertical accessibility. The insertion of the 28 CFR 36 20% language will 

clash and create a glich with our current FS 553.509: Vertical 
accessibility.--Nothing in sections 553.501-553.513 or the guidelines 
shall 
be construed to relieve the owner of any building, structure, or 
facility 
governed by those sections from the duty to provide vertical 
accessibility - 
- - . 

If the Governor signs HB 1307, he will be promoting INACCESSIBILITY in 
Florida. Additionally, there is a clause the Federal ADA that disallows 
a 
facility, or a state, 
to decrease existing accessibility. HB 1307 would achieve that 
undesirable 
affect in Florida and could trigger an investigation by the US 
Department of 
Justice. 

Here is another very important reason for vetoing this bill: This bill 
contains language that would lower the standards for building 
inspections 
around the state. This bill creates a class of new inspectors from the 
private sector who will not have to maintain or possess the same level 
of 
standards possessed by state-certified inspectors. This could lead to 
unsafe 
new structures because these inspectors may show loyalty to the person 
who 
hires and pays them and "overlook" items in favor of their employer. 

I would very much appreciate any help or advice that you could give to 
us. We 
believe that the current "waiver process" is sufficient to satisfy the 
needs 
of both owners of buildings and persons with disabilities. Please help 
us 
protect the rights and privileges afforded to Floridians for which 
individuals with disabilities have worked so hard to obtain. We need to 
make 
every effort to ensure that the Governor will veto this devastating 
piece of 
legislation. 

Please contact the Governors office and persuade him to veto this 
critical 
bill. Please call, write, email and/or fax your concerns about this 
bill.

Florida Economy Poised For Strong Recovery, According to Tony Villamil, Chairman of Gov. Bush Council of Economic Advisors 


CORAL GABLES, Fla., May 10, 2002 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- The Florida economy has demonstrated significant resiliency and has started to recover from the twin externally produced shocks of a global recession and the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, according to former U.S. Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs, Tony Villamil. Mr. Villamil is currently chief executive officer of The Washington Economics Group, and chairman of Governor Jeb Bush Council of Economic Advisors.

Speaking to CEOs of top Florida corporations at the Annual Meeting of the Florida Council of 100 in Naples, the noted economist stressed that Florida's fundamentally sound economy is due primarily to a number of critical factors. Among these factors are:

*An improving business climate under Governor Jeb Bush, including tax
relief, streamlining of regulations and emphasis since 1999 on
educational system improvements, workforce development and investments
in "smart" infrastructure that link producers with the end-use
marketplace.

"There is a no-nonsense and pro-economic development Chief Executive in
Tallahassee.This creates growing confidence in the future of the
State," Villamil said to the Florida executives gathered at the
meeting.

*Florida has become increasingly diversified over the past years,
according to Villamil.The growth of a diversified economic base
includes the expansion of a wide range of knowledge-based services,
defense-related activities and high technology manufacturing, among
other "new economy" industries.

*A final critical factor in creating a large and more resilient Florida
economy is the birth of new economic regions of the State.The North
Florida region, Villamil stated, is expanding strongly, while Southwest
Florida shows growing economic muscle."In essence, we are not as
dependent on one or two economic regions of the State as in the past,"
Villamil reasoned.


In conclusion, according to the well-known economist, "Florida is poised to resume strong economic expansion as the U.S. and global economies recover from the recent recession."

The Washington Economics Group, Inc. (WEG) has been based in Coral Gables, Florida since 1993. WEG is an economic consulting firm, with a growing professional speaking and corporate training practice.

Subject:	RE: Tyndall AFB fup

We are OK.  I have been working with William all week long.  Good guy.  I
talked with Admiral Natter to share community concern (while unfounded) that
Navy training would impact AF training at Tyndall.  This is not the case and
the Admiral has scheduled a meeting w/ Gen Hodgkins (who was not part of
higher level planning and hence what created part of the problem) and
business/community leaders in June to discuss any outstanding
concerns/issues.  A similar meeting was held in Key West and all are pleased
with outcome.  General Hodgkins' boss in AF as well as AF Chief of Staff
have approved plan.  I also had Natter call Senator Graham and Cong Boyd to
discuss the training partnership between AF/Navy because some in the
community had filtered the information up to them--causing unnecessary
concern.

Since then, Boyd issued an editorial that, to my knowledge has not yet run,
but which affirms that Navy is there to partner not destroy.  I will forward
it to you for review in a minute.  I have seen a responding editorial which
Natter plans to submit which assures community that this is a good thing for
Tyndall, Air Force, Navy, Florida and that Navy training is not there to
impact.

Both Brett and Brian brought this to my attention two weeks ago.  We
since
contacted Admiral Natter who coincidentally was having a joint meeting
Navy/Air Force in Key West to resolve outstanding issues.  We told him
that
this was apparently a concern of Hodgkins...which confirmed what he had
heard.  It is my understanding that this issue was addressed directly
last
week at the joint conference.  I will follow-up to be sure.

On a side, it was noted that the activity that the Navy plans to bring
to

Subject: Tyndall AFB


Hey! I'm concerned about the affect of the possible Vieques mission
relocation to Eglin. General Hodgekins indicated to me last week that
move would likely close Tyndall's primary mission of pilot training. The
Navy's proposal of conducting the training missions 3 times a year for 2
weeks each time would prevent Tyndall from training in the Gulf. Since
Eglin controls the Gulf range, they will prohibit Tyndall from using the
range during their training. It is my understanding that Tyndall uses
the range more than all other users combined. The training missions
would disrupt the Tyndall pilot training syllabus so that the pilots
could not complete their training within the schedule outlined by the
Air Force. 

I've talked with Brian Yablonski and Brett Doster about these concerns
and they can give you more details. At your convenience, it might be
useful for you to call General Hodgekins and cross-examine him about
what Vieques-to-Eglin will really mean to Bay County.   

I'm proud of you! William

Dear Governor Jeb Bush, 


Obviously, you didn't receive the following when we sent you our previous message because I forgot to include the attachment. 


*** SEE BELOW *** 


BTW, this is our second request to your office for a review of these matters and we're waiting for a response about the 'public/private partnership' between the DBPR and CAI we sent you earlier this week. 


Please make time to read about the plight of these Miami residents being foreclosed and tossed onto the street and see what you can do to help these people. We appreciate it very much. 


When you need more details to investigate we'll do our best to get them for you. Thank you very much.  


The best to you and yours,

Hello Robert, 


I have been in communication with the State Attorney General's Office in reference to the corruption involving Timberlake Homeowner's Association. 


I am sending copies of my correspondence with you and Tay to Ronald W. Montford who is a regulatory specialist in the Consumer Affairs Division. I wanted to ask you if you would do the same? 


In particular, the letter that you sent to the Governor, etc. 


Would you please send a copy of the email to Mr. Montford that you sent to the Governor and all of the political legislative represenatives? 


I told Mr. Montford about your email and that there was apparently not one single response from it. Mr. Montford seemed surprised there was no response. 


In the latest, I spoke to Tay today by telephone. She is a single mother of 6 children and just had surgery for the removal of breast cancer. 


In our conversation she told me that her next door neighbor, yesterday, tried to commit sucide because of the pressure from the homeowners association in trying to take his home. 


Tay also told me that the population of her neighborhood consists mostly of  retirees. She said it is a very poor community. She said that there was 300 seperate properties that the Homeowners Association Attorney was foreclosing on and that 100 additional properties were being added to the list. The owner of the management company for the homeowners association is an attorney. He is the one that is conducting filing all of the documentation towards the foreclosures on the properties. 


The court date was extended until June 17, 2002. Tay said that in her research of the lawyer he has a long list of lawsuits that have been filed against him in the past. 


Here is Ronald W.Montford's email address... 


His email address is montfor@doacs.state.fl.us 


Thank you for your help and in advance for forwarding any helpful communication or information that you may have to Mr. Montford.

Below is a copy of letter mailed today to Fla Dept. of Agriculture. I think it is very unfair that we are being punished for following water restrictions in our area last year.  Can anyone help us???

May 3, 2002


Florida Dept. of Agriculture
Consumer Services
PO Box 7456
Tallahassee, FL 32314-7456

We had our Citrus tree taken out in the year 2000. After several months we were sent a Shade Florida tree replacement Program card good for $100 tree/shrub replacement from Wal-Mart.  However, by that time, South Florida was in a severe drought and we were under strict water restrictions on watering plants/lawns which went on for several months.  So we did not purchase anything then.  When we tried to use the card we were told it had expired.  

I called the 888 phone number on back of card and spoke with a very nice individual today but she was unable to help me only stating that instructions from Tallahassee were to not extend any expired card dates.

I think this is very unfair in that if we had bought and planted a tree in place of our other one it would have died because we could not water it more then twice a week (our grass was so brown and dead in parts when the water restriction was finally lifted).If it would help, I can send you my card that was sent to me (# on bottom is 6002 8029 1215 8765) for a replacement card if you cannot lift expiration on the card I have.

Please can't you help us with this ??

Subject: USFWS v/s Citizens of Lee County

Dear Governor Bush:

In December (12/22/01), I wrote a letter to the USFWS  (Charles R. Danner) and copied you regarding the J.N."Ding" Darling National Wildlife Refuge expansion project and why I was opposed to such a venture. I received a response from your "Chief Cabinet Aide" (Colleen Castille) and I would like to thank you for that reply. Colleen stated, that your office has spoken with the USFWS representatives in regards to my letter, as well as other letters you received and that there was a follow up meeting scheduled for 1/14/2002 to continue your discussions.

Because of recent developments regarding this proposal here in Lee County, many concerned citizens (in affected areas) would like to hear the results of the 1/14/02 meeting and what your position is on this issue. It appears that the USFWS (J.N. "Ding" Darling) management staff will no longer discuss this proposal with the citizens of Lee County and have withdrawn a request to the BOCC (Lee County Board of Commissioners) to approve a resolution in support of the expansion, resulting in the cancellation of a public hearing which had been scheduled for March 12th. Its the opinion of many that the reason for USFWS pull-out was that there was too much opposition which was  backed up by a petition with thousands of signature.

This action by our own government has humiliated the citizens of Lee County and won't be forgotten. Can you imagine having people like this as your neighbors, but thats whats going to happen if this proposal goes through. 

I have attached a copy of my original letter to the USFWS in Atlanta for your reference. I am hopeful that you will take a few minute and review what is going on here and provide the citizens of Lee County and the Lee County Board of Commissioners with information regarding future action on this issue, because the citizens of Lee County have been hung out to dry by their own Federal government and are very upset. Thank you.

Attch: original letter of  12/22/01

12/22/2001

Mr. Charles R. Danner
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
Division of Refuges
1875 Century Blvd
Atlanta, Ga.   30345

Dear Mr. Danner:

I have read the current "Draft Evironmental Assessment & Land Protection Plan for the Proposed Expansion of the J.N. "Ding" Darling National Wildlife Refuge Complex. Although the document is 104 pages, it is typical of government workmanship (like an IRS document) and is full of a lot of "gobbledygook" and meaningless data (waste of taxpayers dollars). 

I also attended the meeting that was held on Dec 5th, 2001 at St. James City, Fl on Pine Island. This meeting hall was "standing room only" with approximately 270 concerned citizens. During the public comment portion of the meeting, 40 of the 270 attendees stood up and gave their opinions/comments on the proposal. Consensus of opinion for the 40 speakers was that they opposed the expansion proposal and if the applause they received was any indication,
it looked as if much of the audience was in full agreement with the speakers.

A comment was made by a "Ding" Darling management  person, that the primary reason for this expansion is to further protect the bird population. 
Personally,I don't believe that the birds need further protection. We have an abundance of birds here on Pine Island. A recent article (12/16) in the Ft Myers News-Press confirmed this. The article stated that during a recent survey, the birdwatchers counted 10,000 more birds this year than last year. 

It really upsets me to see  our own government (USFWS) deceive the public like it has been doing, all over the country. How do you explain the escapades of the 2 USFWS officials in the State of Washington planting false evidence of Canadian lynx hair? It appeared that it was a very well planned hoax and the 2 perpetrators got their hand slapped and removed from the project. We just can't trust the USFWS with all their lies and deception. 

Your track record for integrity on the island (Pine Island/Matlacha) has a lot to be desired.

What I heard from a "Ding" Darling official at the meeting was what I viewed as the main reason for pushing this proposal through your so called process and it seemed to pertain to money. Apparently, there has been $6 million allocated to the "Ding" Darling Refuge for expansion, with promises of more money in the future. But unless "Ding" Darling management develops the acquisition boundries and gets them approved they will lose the allocation. 

It was also noted that the current manager of the "Ding" Darling Refuge is being transferred to Atlanta, Ga. Wow, wouldn't the approval of this proposal, be a nice feather in his cap if he could pull it off. 

The pathetic part of this fiasco is, I just finished reading a story in the Fort Myers News-Press, that last year in the State of Florida, 1.6 million people were living in poverty. Also, the number of people who were homeless on any given day last year was estimated at 65,597. Guess what? "Big Brother" wants to buy some more land in Florida so that they can rule our lives and have a nice place for the birds to build their nest where nobody will bother them.
How many tons of food can we buy for the homeless with $6 million. Isn't it pathetic to see a government take better care of its wildlife then it does its people. I'm having extreme difficulty trying to understand this scenario. 

Another incident that took place the night of the meeting in the Pine Island Church was that the manager of "Ding" Darling Refuge was informed by one of the attendees of a petition with 900 signatures against the expansion proposal. The response from the manager was that he wasn't running any popularity contest and he was going to do what he felt was right. 

Knowing a little something about management techniques, I can tell you this man would not last long in his job out  in the real world using that type of response to a customer or an employee.  I have a deep down feeling what is going to happen to this letter. I'm sure the USFWS will do what they want. But those responsible for the proposal can tell their superiors that the public was informed and involved.

Several other reasons why I'm opposed, is our loss of tax revenue, the imposing of 100 meter buffer zones around designated islands, fire protection, insurance rates, and impacts to aerial spraying for mosquitos, which is not allowed on Federal Refuge Land.

Bottomline, I really don't want the Federal government and all their ridiculous rules, regulations and restriction as a neighbor. We don't need you and neither do all the birds need you. If  they want to fly from island to island, let them do it, but stay out of their business, they don't need you people to act as their real estate agent. The residents of Matlacha/Pine Island are sick and tired of your harassment. Maybe your time would be better spent if you started screening your organization and weeding out those environmental terrorist such as those you had working on the Washington lynx project.

One final comment. In the Ft Myers News-Press on 12/18, a story ran about "Ding" Darling was having money problems and unless the Federal government bails them out they will be forced to cut back on staff and close on the weekends. My question is: If "Ding Darling Refuge is having financial 
difficulty right now, what is going to happen when they have 45,000 more acres to manage.   

I go on record as being opposed to any of the 3 Alternatives of the proposal. 
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this proposal.

Dear Governor Bush,   

Thank you for emailing us in regards to the flag bill being passed on April 18.   I appreciate this bill S178 that you signed into law and so will many other people in the state Florida.  Hopefully every governor in the United States will follow in your steps and no other American will have go through what we went through with Homeowners Association and Courts. 

One thing we can use is a letter of intent of what the new law states.  Will this law cover all people with flag poles?  Our homeowners association and their attorney refuses to acknowledge this law.  We will have to go back to court and continue our fight to fly the American Flag.   

We would appreciate Governor Bush if you could email us a copy of the amendment of the flag bill. With this bill in hand when we go to back to court, the judge and the attorney for the homeowners will concede to the law and the state ruling. 

Sincerely, 

George & Ann Andres

Adoption Subsidy for a child out of Dade county, Florida requested December 2000.
RE: Steven Lee Brettell
DOB: 02-20-97, born Dade County
Birth Mother: Beverly Susan Brettell, North Miami Beach
Parental rights are not severed on either parent (Father unknown), no contact from either parent with the child since placement on or about November 7, 1999. Birth Mother did attend the court hearing giving us placement.
 
On December 27, 2000 we sent a letter to the Miami, Florida Department of Children and Families Adoption Assistance Department to request adoption subsidy for a special needs child in our care. In the spring of 2000 Judge Sandy Karlan or the Miami Court, Circuit issued permanent custody for the purpose of adoption to us. We are requesting that the state process the subsidy paperwork as Steven is disabled and receiving SSI which qualifies him as IVE eligible. It is now a year and a half later and we still do not have any paperwork to sign to have this child secured in our home through adoption.
We spoke with Attorney Elizabeth Anon about this case early January 2000 prior to us getting custody through the courts. She was able to find limited information on this family.
On January 18th 2001, Graciela Fowler, called to state she received our request and would be gathering the necessary paperwork. She then called the biological grandparent from whom we took custody. They were involved in the initial investigation and were granted custody from the Department of Children and Families until it went in to Civil court under Judge Karlin. The Department had the initial call on the biological mother after Steven was released from the hospital at birth. The situation was unstable and several options were explored. The Department of Children and Families spoke with Kenneth and Nancy Brettell for possible placement and the grandparents. The final decision was the grandparents. Mrs. Fowler was having difficulty finding a case number to show the Departments involvement although the grandparents gave detailed descriptions of the meetings they attending as they were chosen for the placement. 
We received a letter in the mail from Mrs. Fowler dated January 22, 2001 stating she is working the case. We have faxed all of the necessary documentation well over a year and a half ago and nothing is completed for us to sign and move forward for final adoption. We are a family who was told this is the proper way to acquire adoption subsidy for situations such as ours from the local Department of Children and Families as well as the appeals office in Tallahassee. 
If any one can shine a light at the end of this tunnel, we would greatly appreciate the effort put forth. Steven will be starting public school in the fall, it would be wonderful to have this wrapped up to avoid name issues as he builds lasting friendships.
Thank you for your time, if you need any further information feel free to contact us.

Dear Governor Jeb Bush, 


Obviously, you didn't receive the following when we sent you our previous message because I forgot to include the attachment. 


*** SEE BELOW *** 


BTW, this is our second request to your office for a review of these matters and we're waiting for a response about the 'public/private partnership' between the DBPR and CAI we sent you earlier this week. 


Please make time to read about the plight of these Miami residents being foreclosed and tossed onto the street and see what you can do to help these people. We appreciate it very much. 


When you need more details to investigate we'll do our best to get them for you. Thank you very much.  


The best to you and yours, 


Robert Janauskas, Ocala, FL

Hello Robert, 


I have been in communication with the State Attorney General's Office in reference to the corruption involving Timberlake Homeowner's Association. 


I am sending copies of my correspondence with you and Tay to Ronald W. Montford who is a regulatory specialist in the Consumer Affairs Division. I wanted to ask you if you would do the same? 


In particular, the letter that you sent to the Governor, etc. 


Would you please send a copy of the email to Mr. Montford that you sent to the Governor and all of the political legislative represenatives? 


I told Mr. Montford about your email and that there was apparently not one single response from it. Mr. Montford seemed surprised there was no response. 


In the latest, I spoke to Tay today by telephone. She is a single mother of 6 children and just had surgery for the removal of breast cancer. 


In our conversation she told me that her next door neighbor, yesterday, tried to commit sucide because of the pressure from the homeowners association in trying to take his home. 


Tay also told me that the population of her neighborhood consists mostly of  retirees. She said it is a very poor community. She said that there was 300 seperate properties that the Homeowners Association Attorney was foreclosing on and that 100 additional properties were being added to the list. The owner of the management company for the homeowners association is an attorney. He is the one that is conducting filing all of the documentation towards the foreclosures on the properties. 


The court date was extended until June 17, 2002. Tay said that in her research of the lawyer he has a long list of lawsuits that have been filed against him in the past. 


Here is Ronald W.Montford's email address... 


His email address is montfor@doacs.state.fl.us 


Thank you for your help and in advance for forwarding any helpful communication or information that you may have to Mr. Montford.

Subject: FCAT and Orlando





Dear Governor Bush,
My name is Christine Edwards.  My parents have written to you many times 
regarding their concerns for my future.  However, I would like to share with 
you my concerns about my future. As of May 24, 2002, I will be a senior in 
the Visual and Performing Arts Theatre Magnet at Dr. Phillips High School in 
Orlando, Florida.  I am an honors student with learning disabilities.  I 
have dreamt of attending college to pursue my dreams and enhance my 
education since I was a little girl.  However, it doesn't look like I will 
have that  opportunity in the state of Florida.  I will not graduate next 
May with my diploma, nor my peers, nor the VPA seal that I have earned 
because, although I have taken the math section of the FCAT three times, I 
cannot pass it without the use of my accommodations.  I have been denied the 
use of those accommodations during that last 3 attempts.  Because of those 
denials, my anxiety has only gotten worse creating an even more stressful 
situation while taking the test.

I have never been allowed to use any of my Section 504 accommodations, 
including my right to test privately. The FCAT has sealed my fate and 
decided my future. I have a severe anxiety disorder known as Obsessive 
Compulsive Disorder and a learning disorder known as Non Verbal Learning 
Disorder that both severely impact my ability for recall.   Each time I have 
taken the math section of the FCAT without my accommodations and failed, my 
symptoms have become worse. I have panic attacks just thinking about the 
FCAT and my future without a college degree. I worry about not receiving my 
diploma and the impact that alone will have on my future.  Numerous times,I 
have made myself ill with worry.  There is no logical reason for me not to 
pass the FCAT, other than my disabilities. I have met the Sunshine State 
Standards required to graduate with a standard high school diploma, except 
for passing the FCAT. My math teachers from the last 3 years in high school 
are writing our Superintendent of Schools to ask him to request a waiver for 
me from the State of Florida's Department of Education, because my 
disabilities won't permit me to pass the FCAT math section. I can't benefit 
from the FCAT now, after 3 failed attempts, and the State won't benefit from 
my taking it. The State of Florida has all but guaranteed that I will never 
graduate with a standard diploma and I will be left behind, despite 
President Bush's Education initiative.

I need your help. Please help me. I need you to intervene on my behalf.  I 
need an FCAT math section waiver.  I want the future I am entitled to have.  
I have worked hard for almost 12 years to keep my grades high, I have put in 
many long hours studying and building bridges over my disabilities. I have 
been an exemplary student. Because I have such trouble taking tests due to 
the impact of my disability on my ability to recall, I won't be awarded any 
scholarships to help pay for any further education, even though I have met 
the criteria with community service, course work and grades. The fact is, I 
don't test well due to my disabilities and I am being punished by the State 
because of it.

I want to be a productive member of my community and my country. Without a 
high school diploma, I cannot have a college education, a dream or a future. 
  Without a college education, I am doomed to low paying jobs and no 
opportunities to further enhance my education or reach my goals.  I will be 
a child left behind. Please help me.

I found out today that you will be visiting my high school next Tuesday, May 
14, 2002 during 5th and 6th period.  I would love the opportunity to meet 
you in person and talk with you regarding my concerns not only for myself 
but for the future of all disabled students in the state of Florida. Thank 
you for taking the time to read my letter.

Sincerely,
Christine "Kirsty" Edwards
Student, Dr. Phillips High School
Visual and Performing Arts Theatre Magnet
Orlando, Florida

Dear Governor Bush -

I am Izzy Rommes, Commander of the 160th MP Bn which was mobilized in 
January. You attended our ceremony, and also gave me your email address 
if we needed anything. Something has come up pertaining to the state 
which I hope you can assist with. I work for the Department of 
Agriculture and have also asked them to assist with this matter.

My wife received a letter today from Bill Hoard / Employee Benefit 
Consultants who provides the DACS insurance administraton. The letter 
stated my insurance would be cancelled after 6 months of active duty, 
and this will occur in June. I am presently paying for life and extra 
medical coverage. The state also provides life and medical as I am a 
select exempt employee.

I do not know what insurance is referred to, but whether it is 
insurance which I pay for or insurance provided by the state, I do not 
believe my insurance should be terminated. Terminating insurance seems 
contrary to the soldiers and sailors relief act and clearly is 
detrimental to all of the reservists who are state employees and were 
called to active duty.

Thank you for listening and for any assistance you can render in this 
matter.

FYI our unit will be leaving for Guantanimo Bay soon and we will fly 
the Florida flag which you gave us as soon as we occupy the site.

Dear Governor:  
    We have been trying to negotiate a clean-up agreement of Cascade
Park here in Tallahassee with DMS and DEP on behalf of the City.  Over
the last 2 months I've tried to keep Colleen Castille informed and have
been working through Bob Ballard.  We appear to be at an impasse but
wanted to implore you to take a look at our 5/7 letter summarizing the
City's position because the City is willing to limit the state's
exposure to approximately $500,000 for all the clean-up if the city can
receive a sufficient interest  in the land to do the clean-up and  the
stormwater/recreational improvements recommended in the Cabinet endorsed
BLUE PRINT 2000 plan.  
Before we become resigned to allow a court decide our respective
clean-up laibility I ask you give this a personal inquiry and see if
there's not a win-win resolution.  Thanks      Frank Matthews

Subject:	Giving Governor Bush Credit/ The Packer

Efforts pay off as farm bill goes to Bush’s desk By Tom Karst 
(May 10) WASHINGTON, D.C. — The 2002 farm bill is signed, sealed and delivered, but the issues raised in the bill and the produce industry’s coordinated approach to make its voice heard on Capitol Hill will be long remembered. 

Amid debate that characterized the farm bill as either an obscenely expensive move toward collective agriculture or a necessary safety net for struggling American farmers, the Senate passed the farm bill 64-35 and sent it to President Bush. He was expected to sign the bill early the week of May 12. 

The bill increases agricultural spending by nearly 80% over the cost of existing programs because of added subsidies to program crops, including rice, wheat, cotton, corn and soybeans. Expected to cost $190 billion over the next decade, it has been panned by global trading partners. One economist gives the farm bill a 20% chance of exceeding WTO limits on direct subsidies to farmers in its first year. 

LITTLE DIRECT AID 

Relative to the produce industry, issues like country-of-origin labeling, export assistance and increased federal purchases of fruits and vegetables were written into the bill and will continue to make headlines in coming years. 

The produce industry received little in direct aid, though apple growers did receive $94 million in direct market loss assistance. 

U.S. Apple Association president and chief executive officer Kraig Naasz said more than two dozen senators and 50 members of the House of Representatives voiced support for the inclusion of the apple aid in the final conference report. 

The country-of-origin labeling provision of the farm bill pleased domestic growers. 

In a news release, Florida Farmers Inc., an advocacy group of Florida winter vegetable growers, commended Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla.; Rep. Mary Bono, R-Calif.; Florida Gov. Jeb Bush; and Florida Agriculture Commissioner Charles Bronson for their efforts to keep country-of-origin labeling in the final farm bill report. 

“The grass-roots effort overcame the well-financed corporate food chain lobby to win the right to know and choose the place of origin of our food,” said Paul DiMare, chairman of Florida Farmers and president of DiMare Homestead, Homestead, Fla. 

“Country-of-origin labeling helps American consumers and those American farmers who provide food for American consumers,” he said. 

UNITED FRONT 

Naasz said the overall effort from the produce industry on the farm bill was remarkable and unprecedented. 

“The work the produce industry did under the umbrella effort afforded by United to develop an agenda and top priority policy objectives and then to assemble the troops and presented a united front to Congress was critical to the success,” he said. 

He said the work on the farm bill provides a “template” for how work on the next big issue, which he said is the reauthorization of child nutrition programs. 

“In my view, the nutrition reauthorization act offers a far greater opportunity for the produce industry to promote the increased consumption of its produce and improve the economic condition of our overall industry,” he said.

School is almost out and in 3 years, Alex, my student, has gone from the school bully to a model student.  His grades were  D's and F's when I started Mentoring 3 years ago, now he makes A's and B's.  School officials can't belive it's the same student. Please let me know if I can do anything to promote Mentoring or to help in your campaign.

- We are holding bi-weekly conference calls with our partners on this
project.  The key items to date have been logistical:  setting up a
process
to disseminate smoothly.  Here is where we are:

- We have a coordinated team of partners from Fl Hospital Association
(FHA),
Dept of State, Scholastic, Florida Literacy Coalition, United Way, David
Lawrence's office, etc. who are involved in every-other-week conference
calls.  This week we approved two surveys:  one will go out from FHA to
the
hospitals regarding what hospitals are currently doing; best contact
persons; ways to collaborate etc.  A separate survey will go out from
United
Way for us to "Success by Six" and other similar programs to see how we
might work cooperatively with them etc.

- We have received bids from around the state on setting up a
Fulfillment
Center which would take in orders and then place the shipments to the
hospitals (this is fairly complicated process with the number of pieces
we
have in the packages and the fact that we will issue in 3 languages).
We
are working with a partner who we believe will make a 6 year commitment
to
ensuring that this project stays up and running.  Next week we begin
working
on timeline issues.

PHONE LINE STORY TIME
- Have met with PBS and completed budget; one-page overview of program;
are
working with partner we believe will be in place by next week to serve
as
PBS sponsor and buy books airing for mentors to also read with kids!;
planning to begin (as initially targeted) the program on July 1 and
would
use the well-known PBS character "Arthur" as the first reader.   Working
on:
who handles 800#'s; capacity issues; etc.

TEEN TRENDSETTERS
- Waiting on scheduling for date to kick off.  Have sent info out to all
principals, Monday Report, etc.  AAA has come one as partner and next
week
work with them on student scheduling etc.  Also working on more connects
to
get info on program direct to students.  Great article in Florida Trend
on
program.

PR PIECES:
- McDonald's tray liners - verbiage sent out previously.  See attachment
for
the picture we believe we would like to use for billboard and tray
liner.
Comments appreciated.  McDonald's piece needs to be finalized by Tues of
next week.
- Billboards - will have draft for your review on Monday
- Winn Dixie - draft for review mid- next week.

BUSINESS CHALLENGE
- World Class has really been getting out the word!  Terrific
partnerships
coming out of there.  Look for announcement we will do next week with LG
at
Bond Ele involving World Class and Bank of America on early reading for
kindergarten kids over the summer using Open Court.  If goes well, Bank
of
America may consider taking statewide.

More happening, but if you read this far - thanks!

Dear Jeb,
I have not emailed or spoken with you for a while, since I have been very busy with the Board of Medicine and my work as the medical director of an Emergency Department in WPB.

Once again, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to serve the people of the State of Florida on the Board of Medicine, it has required long hours and many difficult decisions but it is very gratifying work that I truly enjoy.

All is well, and my wife Stephanie and I still live in Manalapan (in another home next to the one that you were in years ago) and still very happily married.

If you are in the area of Manalapan (or Palm Beach) Thursday, June 27th, Friday 28th or Saturday 29th, in the evening between 7-9 PM, I would like very much to see you at one of these three receptions to "say a few words."

I am a member of a physician's organization; AAPS (American Association of Physician Specialists) that upon my recommendation will be having there annual meeting at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Manalapan this June (next month).

I know that it is short notice but the Opening Reception is Thurs. 27th, I will also be personally hosting a Florida Reception the 28th at our home in Manalapan and the Presidents Reception and Dinner is Sat 29th, at the Ritz. Any brief appearance at one of these functions would give you the opportunity to get additional physician supporters and make for some good public relations.

If your schedule is full and you cannot attend I understand, then a "brief letter" that I can read to the audience of over 300 physician leaders from across the country (100 or more doctors which are politically active and practice in Florida) and their guest or families, would be great!

You are a great Governor and a man that I personally truly admire, it would be terrific to see you again real soon.

You and your family have our families' complete and unwavering support. 
Please let me know if I could be of any additional help to you now and in the future.

I don't like to give gratuitous advice but in my not so humble opinion she is a failed agency head and an albatross around your neck. I know you are loyal but there are limits.  While it is true that agency was a cesspool to begin with and substantial improvements have been made in the organization and delivery of services through your programs, the heart of coddling ineptness and failure to supervise survives.  With each scandal that surfaces there, the same theme comes up again and again. Indifferent and shirking employees with supervisors who turn a blind eye rather than rock the boat. We see an agency head who just clucks her tongue, blames her own employees but does nothing to change the institutional attitude.  This latest personal scandal with her ex-husband presents a fine opportunity for her to simply resign citing the need to attend to personal matters. 

You need a kick ass agency head. I'd go in there and for the next six months have half of DCF, all the liberal newspapers and unions screaming bloody murder but at the end of that six months you'd have employees who knew their jobs and that they better work their rear ends off doing them or they would be history and supervisors who were expected to supervise and knew they'd get full backing if they did. 

So much for my soap box.  I'll see you Monday morning without it.

Terry,

I announced earlier this week that I will be stepping down from my County Commission seat as of May 18th. To make a long and difficult story short, a fairly serious squabble with my health insurance company over the replacement of a failed insulin pump left me without the device for a month and sent me into a serious physical tailspin from which I am having difficulty recovering. As my family and my doctor have told me, if I'll turn the same focus on getting better and returning to stability that I have to my job as a County Commissioner, I'll be fine. So that's what I'm going to be working on for the next few months.

Naturally, I'm both weirdly relieved and a little heartbroken right now. And the not feeling well part isn't exactly helping. But I did want you to know that I have always considered you the finest example of what government service can be, and it has been a tremendous honor to work with you on issues over the issues - and a source of great joy to me to consider you a friend.

All the best always

Nora

Subject: Stop the Blight


May 11, 2002

Dear Governor Bush:

A positive trend is sweeping the nation and we hope with you will decide to 
further its success.  Numerous citizens of small, mostly waterfront 
communities who have been living under the threat of eminent domain are 
relieved to learn that courts are stepping in to stop the abuse of this 
power.  When private property is taken from one citizen and handed over to 
another by the government, our nation becomes similar to a communist state. 
This disheartening abuse of governmental power has been running rampant and 
unchecked until relatively recently.

Unfortunately, the Florida Legislature just passed a bill that would
facilitate the abuse of the power of eminent domain by weakening the
criteria by which an area is declared "blighted."  Oftentimes Governor Bush, 
an area is declared blighted when it is not simply as a formality in order 
to allow a local government to work closely with real estate developers. The 
properties are promised as parking lots or other amenities needed by the 
developer to further "economic development" of an area.  I thought if I 
could briefly describe our situation to you, you would have a better 
understanding of the impact on human lives of the legislation that will soon 
appear before you for your endorsement or rejection.

After graduating in August 1999, my husband, a Florida native, and I chose 
Daytona Beach as our home.  We both teach at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical 
University.  We chose our 1924 home in an historic neighborhood after 
shopping in the area from Palm Coast to Ponce Inlet for an entire year.  Now 
our city officials have declared our neighborhood "blighted."  The blight 
study was completed by a single city staffer who drove around and conducted 
a "windshield survey."

A full 86% of the homes in this "Supplemental Blight Study" are in standard 
or better condition. When I spoke with the staffer and asked her how she 
decided where to draw her red line which encompassed our house and 
approximately 60 of our neighbors' homes, she replied that the "depth is 
generally what developers need."  I ask you Governor Bush, how the needs of 
a developer constitute blighted conditions in my neighborhood!

Please do not sign this bill into law when it comes before you! My husband 
and I worked 10 years to attain our Ph.D.s and we chose to live by the sea. 
Our Daytona Beach City government has no right to abuse the power of eminent 
domain to take our home to hand over to a private real estate developer.  If 
"economic development" is the only explanation needed by officials to abuse 
this power, absolutely no home is safe.  Any resident's home could be taken 
and the area could become another theme park or the like to raise the local 
tax base.  The eminent domain power was created to better communities by 
either ridding a community of slum-like conditions, or to seize private 
property for a sound PUBLIC purpose.

Please take a stand against the state legislature by opposing the
facilitation of government infringement on private property rights!

Feel free to write or call with any questions or comments.

Sincere thanks for your consideration,
Drs. Mary and Rich Snow

Dear Lauri,

Thank you so much for sending me this e-mail.  My heart breaks for the
wonderful case workers like you that get up every morning and give it their
all for Florida's children.  Your voice is the one that must be heard and
believed -- not those that call themselves "advocates" and do nothing to
help repair a system that is beyond broken.  The description of your
average day at Family Continuity is an eye-opener.  I've been lobbying
Congress for three years to change the federal requirements (e.g. the IV-E
time logs you mention for one) to make it easier on the workers in the
field.  I hope that you will let me use your e-mail as an example of the
true impact of this on families.  Community-based care was designed to free
up workers to spend time with families, not bog them down in paperwork.

I hope that the St. Pete Times will print your e-mail.  Your passion for
the profession is an inspiration in these challenging times.  Thank you for
your work on behalf of the children of Pasco and Pinellas counties.  They
are lucky to have a person like you in their corner.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

5/11/02

To tell the complete story, one must hear the 'other side'.  I sincerely
hope you find the means to publish this as well.

Dear Curtis and Howard,

I'm writing you because I'm an employee of Family Continuity Programs (FCP)
and read your articles in the St. Pete Times.  I'm a case manager who
supervises nearly 40 children.  So you'll understand exactly what this
means let me explain....  One child is actually part of a woven dynamic
that may involve his biological parents, step parents, paramours if his
parents are living with a partner, a relative placement/non-relative
placement or licensed foster family if he's removed.  Thus, this ONE
child's supervision is actually equivalent to supervising 7 people,
providing both parents are divorced, each have another partner, and the
child's been removed, which is often the case.  Thus, 'one' child does NOT
mean 'one' child under my supervision...it means supervising the whole
family dynamic.  Additionally, 40 children does not mean 40 families.  For
example, I could have 20 families, each with 2 children, and that would
equal the 40 children I'm supervising while having 20 cases (families).

With every child comes enormous paperwork - on ALL parties involved with
this ONE child.  There's the case plan we write after reviewing the file,
there's the hearing to file said case plan which we must attend, there's
the additional referrals we hand-write and explain to all parties involved
so they'll clearly understand the case plan they're required to complete,
there's the initial judicial review we write at 90 days which is
approximately 15 pages long (this is a status update to the court regarding
the family's progress and requires us to be at the court hearing), there's
the referral packets we put together for this family (between  5-20  pages
upon completion) that is a requirement of most programs,  there's the
endless phone calls to all providers requesting proof, or lack thereof, of
attendance of these programs we have referred the family to, there's the
endless phone calls to and from the families and FCP attorneys regarding
other problems we must address,  there's the continual ongoing diligent
searches we must complete for absent parents, there's the supervised
visitations we must arrange and supervise if court ordered, there's the
transportation we must provide to assist this family if they don't own a
car or can't take the bus, there's the multiple staffings we must arrange
to evaluate and re-evaluate permanency goals, there's the required
one-time-per-week home visit if this family is determined 'high risk', or,
the required every-other-week home visit if this family is determined
'medium risk', or, the required one home visit per month if this family is
determined 'low risk' which requires a 5 page packet that must be filled
out at every monthly home visit,  there's the paperwork we must do if this
family is in need of financial assistance, there's the continual 6 month
judicial review we must write for this family until the case is closed and
attend the hearing, there's the updated case plan we must re-write and file
when it expires (between 12-18 months), and there's the chronology notes we
must write every time we so much as speak to this family, and the list goes
on and on.  And this is for ONE family only.

Multiply this by 20 families, and I think you get the picture of our
workload.  Of course there's the children that come in through ICPC (out of
state/interstate compact) that require a written home study,  supervision
and monthly home visits if approved, and referrals (their state does the
required legal paperwork - we only report quarterly), and there's the
courtesy supervision cases from other counties that we do the same.  Out of
approximately 20 families, I maybe have 3 of these kinds of cases.

Simultaneously, I have other cases who's children have run-away and I'm
forced to stop what I'm doing to write a pick-up order, simultaneously I'm
getting calls from other families who are in the midst of a break down I
must tend to, simultaneously I'm getting calls from foster families who
want children out NOW, thus, I'm running out to pick up said child while
arranging alternate placement with our placement coordinator,
simultaneously I'm getting a call from the JAC Center stating they've
picked up my runaway and I must get this child within so many hours and
either return said child to his placement or have a shelter hearing first
thing in the morning to change placement, simultaneously I have 2
arraignments in the morning and 4 Judicial Reviews in the afternoon I must
attend, simultaneously I have 2 permanency staffings scheduled in between
my court times, simultaneously I'm still trying to find placement for this
child since the morning, to no avail, and in between all, I'm writing this
all down because I can't do ANYTHING without chrono notes for the files.
It's now 8P and after getting breakfast, lunch, and dinner for this child,
I'm still at the office awaiting placement for him and could be here until
10P at this rate, and it's only Monday...

This does not include the daily time logs we're required to do in no less
than 15 minute increments (this is a report of EVERYTHING we've done to
account for our time - every day of every week).  This does not include the
tracking logs we're required to do every Monday.  This does not include the
'unannounced' minimum monthly home visits we must do - which means we have
to work after 6P when the children get home from their required day care
programs. This does not include the one week of 'on-call' we're required to
do from 5P to 8A every 3-4 months.  This does not include the continual
meetings and trainings we must attend to either get our certifications or
maintain them.

My caseload is supposed to be no more than 20 children; it's now at 36 and
climbing all the time.  Why?  We do all of the above for an approximate
salary of $27,000 per year working 50+ hours per week, so the burnout and
turnover rate is enormous.  We do home visits at night by ourselves, we
transport children by ourselves at all hours of the day and night putting
ourselves at risk for the obvious, and we're not equipped with cell phones
in the field - which would not only increase our safety, but make us more
available to our families when needed.   When families say we don't care,
that we don't tend to their emergencies in a timely manner, let me say
this...what an emergency is to a family, and what an emergency is to a case
manager, are two completely different entities. When a family calls and
says, "This is an emergency, Susie won't go to school..." and on the other
line I have a mother telling me her paramour beat her last night and abused
the children, it's obvious which 'emergency' a case manager will tend to
first - EVERYTHING ELSE must be put on hold - including Susie. The
responsibilities to our families and children is incredible, and add the
mounds of paperwork that is a required priority...and you wonder, who would
even consider this job....

Well, let me tell you....

We are case managers who love children dearly and feel a need to save them
from one more day of trauma.  We work for a wonderful organization called
FCP who understands our plight and supports us emotionally.   Like you, we
are mothers, fathers, sons and daughters.  We do our job the best we can,
with the limited resources we have, in the face of overwhelming adversity,
because we genuinely care.   When we hear in the media we don't have a
conscience, I'm sorry, I tend to take that personally.  It's not the case
managers you should be pointing your finger at, it's the system we work
under that needs reform.  All I ask is you walk in our shoes for one
week...just one week...and I'm sure you'll never point your finger again -
not at us anyway.

Julie, 

In the House proposal yesterday the House matched the Senate: 

Additional Resources ADA Workgroup     1.00  FTE GR  30,456 
Additional Resources ADA Clearinghouse 2.00 FTE GR 250,000 
ADA Federal Grant                                         803,050 


The Committee will meet again at 1:00 to receive the Senate offer.
Hopefully the Senate will not have change from their earlier positions as
it
is now the same on both sides. (The meeting time is subject to change).

Call me if you have any questions. 

Thanks Scarlet

Subject:	ADAWG - Accessibility code issue

Hola Jeb:

In the multitude of issues that you have to deal with, this is a minute
one, but I feel responsible to give you my perspective in the conflict
situation related to the accessibility code conflict on the ADAWG.

The technical aspect of the accessibility code issue is a complex matter
which I do not understand very much.  Angel WATS, and JR Harding seem to
be the board members with greatest knowledge on the issue, and they were
in disagreement.  Julie Shaw, is also knowledgeable about the issue, so
the disagreement on this issue may not have anything to do with a
personality conflict between Julia and Angel.  I do want to share with
you that there is a clear personality conflict between Angel and Julie,
which is less apparent now that Angel is not the chair, but still very
obvious.  I privately addressed the issue with Julie during our last
meeting, as I do not think it portraits a good image to the public.  I
think she heard me, and I hope that she deals with the issue.  My
impressions of Julie, is that she is a strong advocate, and very
knowledgeable across disability issues, but she can sometimes appear to
be rough.

Carinos

Berthy

Wow do I feel attacked.  It appears you are basing your response on an
opinion Doug told you or you are taking this personally.  I  have already
notified all people involved about the ADAWG decision and the content of
the
letter to come, in fact that evening of the vote, again the next day,
Friday
afternoon and in subsequent meetings in Tallahassee which have been
numerous.  
 
What you don't seem to understand is that the Governor will determine his
position on the issue.  I have no stance in my current role.  I can only
share what the intent at that time was.  The letter would have gone
earlier
if the bill was not delayed by the Senate.  I am watching it very
closely.
The letter will be in the Governor's Office before he receives the bill. 
It
will be included.  The Governor makes no comments to emails or
correspondence on pending legislation until his decision is made.  The
process to have a decision doesn't even begin until the bill hits the
Governor's Office.  Everything is collected, organized and a report
written
reflecting all views, issues, etc.  Then he makes the decision and no one
else.
 
I can only apologize for my email workload.  I currently have 578 emails
in
my system and over 100 not opened.  I am not the entry point for
Governor's
communication.  I forwarded the initial emails on the subject to board
members.  I had several complaints about them.  But from what I can tell,
all of the letters have been collected by OPB and there was a coordinated
effort to do that.  I try to process as many emails as possible daily,
skim
titles and content if necessary and handle the priorities first.  Based
on
the delay of the bill - it is still in the Senate - it was not a priority
compared to other items pending.  The Governor has up to 15 days once his
office receives the bill to make a decision.
 
No members advised me the Clarification Statement was confusing.  You
kept
saying it was to other members but no one spoke up or asked for
assistance
during the break when the questions were being composed.  If there was
confusion I believe it is because the code is a very technical issue and
if
you do not work with it daily or frequently it is impossible to
understand.
 
 
I don't have a position until the Governor's decision is made. ADAWG's
board
has a position which has been clearly communicated.  Individuals may have
a
position and some associations do.  
 
I am no longer a private sector employee.  My interest 100% was to
protect
the access code  and the interests of people with disabilities as much as
possible in my role overseeing all 3 programs for the Governor and as an
advocate for compliance with the ADA or a better standard.  That agenda
has
never changed.  Just because I am in a different role compared to a
private
lobbyist does not mean my understanding of the code, needs of people with
disabilities, commitment etc. has changed.  
 
We have a difference of opinion about how much damage, if any, the
amendment
could do to the access code if passed into law.  But we aren't the only
ones.  And I believe that can be considered the good or the bad things
about
making laws.
 
Your expertise on building codes has never been doubted.  The issue is
you
take positions on certain items not everyone agrees with.  And just
because
there is a disagreement does not mean the other opinion has an ulterior
motive or change in agenda.  To say that this is not a priority of the
ADAWG
Office or the Governor's is a statement not based on fact.  The
Governor's
commitment to people with disabilities and this office is clearly seen
time
and time again in the agendas pursued and changes made.  Once again,
there
has been NO decision or position determined by the Governor to date.   
 
Your motions to not ask the Governor's Office to consult with me on
issues
in the future, I believe is a reflection of you personalizing this
difference of opinion.  I apologize if I am misinterpreting you actions
differently.

                 << Message: RE: Your emails >> Julie,
                    Hi, no, actually Doug Towne (works with me) said he
had
breakfast with 
                you the morning before we met at the Governors offices,
and
he got the 
                impression that it was an Angel/Julie thing. I hope at
the
meeting you were 
                assured it is the issue, not the individual.
                    I was referring to the emails from citizen's I had
sent
you (and others 
                said they forwarded your office) PRIOR to the ADAWG
meeting.
I thought it was 
                amazing that you did not forward them to the board
members,
since we are 
                supposed to be the Governor's ear on issues with
disabilities, and yet on 
                this issue we had not heard anything. 
                    I don't think it was because it was a code issue,
Linda
said she was 
                worried about the Sunshine Law because the only emails on
HB1307 came from me 
                as a one way communication. I feel communication from the
public that I 
                forwarded you should have been sent by your office as
information only as you 
                do with the Transportation Disadvantage Bill information,
and other bills 
                concerning accessibility. 
                    Members can choose to read or ignore, I am not as
versed
on some issues 
                as other members in their area of expertise, but I strive
to
understand the 
                issue. If members are not willing to stretch, perhaps the
Governor should 
                take a look at the membership. I am versed in Building
Code.
I teach it, I do 
                tech assist on it, I work with it every day. I understand
the devastating 
                effect this will have on our lives. If this issue is not
a
priority of ADAWG 
                or the Governor's Administration, then I am certainly
serving on the wrong 
                board! Naturally, all the members of ADAWG have expressed
great interest in 
                accessibility when talking to me, I was just surprised
that
they hadn't heard 
                about the amendment from you. 
                    The clarification letter that you handed out was
definitely confusing for 
                them, even JR was way in left field. I felt it did not
address the issue at 
                all, Kevin Tang has our corrections if they were to be
issued to the public. 
                    It was the motion to write a letter to the Governor
asking him not to 
                allow our Florida Building Code to be defaulted to
Federal
Code that I was 
                inquiring about. It was a full board vote and action
item,
so I would think 
                the letter would be done by now, and I certainly think
the
Governor would 
                recognize the letterhead of his working group, and hope
it
would not be 
                counted as a single request for Veto. 
                    We handed letters to Alan Florez (remember the
package
you were opening?) 
                on letterhead from organizations asking him to Veto the
bill. I can assure 
                you, I signed the one from Caring & Sharing, representing
2,000 members, they 
                are well informed of code issues, with my Executive
Director's approval and 
                discussions with board of directors and members. I can
have
each of them call 
                if the Governor would like. There are 14 Centers for
Independent Living whose 
                prime directive is accessing goods and services from
businesses and job 
                opportunities for people with disabilities. 50% of board
and
staff are 
                individuals with disabilities, and we take it very
seriously
when our 
                accessibility standards are lowered. 
                    Actually, Alan Florez's office was a great help and
gave
me the 
                information on what number to call, and Ben sent an email
out with a web site 
                for bill tracking, but thanks anyway, I would have called
you if they 
                couldn't find out.
                    What's done is done, the bill needs to be Veto'd now.
You did say at 
                dinner after the ADAWG meeting that you didn't see a
problem
with vetoing the 
                bill, but then again, you didn't seem to be supportive at
the meeting with 
                the Governor's office, so don't mind it, but I am going
around you to get the 
                job done this time, OK?
                    Looking forward to seeing everyone at the Commission
meeting, I am going 
                to the Devil Rays Game for Mother's day :), so probably
won't get there until 
                later. See you at the meeting! Happy Mother's Day,

Dear Gov. Bush:

On behalf of the patrons of the dog tracks and poker rooms in Florida, I 
would like to encourage you to Support Senate Bill 160.

Greyhounds are dogs that must run.it is their nature and they enjoy it.  
Greyhounds have very sweet dispositions and make wonderful pets when their 
careers are over.  It is with this  Bill 160  that more greyhounds will be 
adopted.  Through the Support of this legislation, the greyhounds adoption 
program will be mandatory at ALL DOG TRACKS.

As it is now  more animals are killed in just one humane society shelter than 
all the greyhounds in the United States.  For this reason alone yhou should 
SUPPORT  BILL 160.

The poker rooms at the tracks have numerous employees that will be unemployed 
if the card rooms close.  Increasing the stakes of the poker games will not 
only bring in more people, but also more REVENUE TO THE STATE OF FLORIDA.  We 
have to many $'s passing through FLordia and going out  to SEA, that we don't 
benefit from.

By forcing the Poker Rooms to support the Greyhounds, this will benefit the 
greyhound adoption program and save jobs.

PLEASE SUPPORT BILL 160

Subject:	Before you.....

Hi,

I was just sitting here studying the picture of little Rilya Wilson on my 
computer screen considering the situation and thought of a few things. I 
offer them as suggestions as what I would do if  I could....

1. Go back to the beginning. Identify Rilya Wilson from the date of her 
birth. Establish paternity.

2. Reestablish the time line of the disappearance. Who was where when. And 
don't take anyone's word for anything.  Court admissible proof only.

3. Call "all in free" in the DCF.  Shake out who is where and for how 
long.  Once you know what else has happened you will know more about where 
in the system you should look.  Nothing like a little spring housecleaning 
to clean out those cobwebs and show you where the spiders live. And a few 
pet spiders can be very helpful at times.

You have a lot of good people in the DCF  who are simply overwhelmed and 
out classed by those who would do them in. In bringing in a reformer to 
clean up the system you were seen to blame them and not the system.  And 
Kathleen Kearney's reputation preceded her. Very few people in this world 
will openly say "I don't understand" or "I'm lost help me" to someone 
brought in for the express purpose of reforming a department. To avoid 
saying anything that would even hint incompetence, they stonewalled her or 
told her what they think she wanted to hear. Nothing changed! I saw it by 
running the exact same letter by various people in the system from top to 
bottom and getting to see what they said to me and to others in return. It 
was very illuminating. They will bad mouth one of their own or shuffle 
departments to cover up their own confusion. They will even sacrifice one 
of their own on the altar of self preservation. They're completely normal 
in an abnormal system. Once they see you understand that, they will be much 
more open with you and you will be on the way to solving the overall 
problem not just the case at hand. Do nothing and it will happen again and 
again and again.

Do I think Rilya is lost in the system? Not really. I'm still waiting to 
hear who Rilya really is.  Okay, if you accept the notion we know who Rilya 
really is and who her family is, do I think someone from the DCF came and 
took Rilya away some nefarious purpose? No. Someone took her away but I 
doubt strongly it was the DCF. My best guess based on limited access to 
information would be that she was sold off to the drug trade as a mule. Who 
did? You have to figure that one out.

Here's a wild suggestion as to how to get a hint on how to solve the case. 
A new tv show based in Miami is just about the surest thing in television. 
It's called CSI-Miami. Every episode is a mystery to be solved by evidence. 
The writers think up elaborate schemes to solve every day. Give them a shot 
at the evidence so far and ask the writers to write you an ending.  Want 
the phone number for the production office of the series? I have it.

Just my musings on a lazy Sunday afternoon.

Commission stand-ins get early kudos


Array of experience, diversity seen as pluses for interim county leaders


Bios and Q&As

 <mailto:ginnygraybiel@pensacolanewsjournal.com> Ginny Graybiel
@PensacolaNewsJournal.com

A retired newspaper publisher who golfs with many of Pensacola's older and well-regarded leaders.

A longtime legislative aide with a knack for helping people and scrutinizing budgets.

A retired educator who calls people "darlin"' and is a popular member of the Pensacola City Council.

A retired vice admiral who works in Pensacola's most elite academic and research circles.

Cliff Barnhart, Janice Gilley, Marie Young and Tim Wright will be sworn in this week as Escambia County commissioners.

Gov. Jeb Bush selected them from 158 applicants to fill in for indicted and suspended commissioners W.D. Childers, Terry Smith, Willie Junior and Mike Bass. They've all promised to act as `'caretakers" until the indictees' charges are resolved or another election comes along, and they've agreed not to seek election on their own.

After months of turmoil capped off by the indictments of every commissioner except Tom Banjanin, a number of board watchers are looking at the appointees as opportunity knocking.

"It's a great group," said former state Rep. Buzz Ritchie. "In terms of their involvement with the community, they are certainly well qualified, and they're all good people."

They're also a diverse group.

Barnhart, Gilley and Wright are Republicans; Young is a Democrat.

Young is only the second black member of the board. Junior, who served for 19 years, was the first.

Young and Gilley are the second and third women members. The pioneer, Muriel Wagner, represented District 4 from 1985 to 1989 but lost her re-election bid.

Frank Montenes, who attends most commission meetings and is a leading advocate of a switch to charter government, likes the fact the appointees come from different backgrounds.

"If you look at their credentials, they're pretty well-balanced," he said. "The best way to sum it up is that these are people who are in touch with reality and in touch with the grass roots. They're going to allow the community to rally around them and heal and cooperate."


Business experience


Barnhart, 80, the District 1 appointee, has a lot of support among Pensacola's business community as well as among affluent retirees as Childers' replacement.

Pensacola businessman Eric Nickelsen, one of Bush's top local advisers, said Barnhart fits the bill perfectly for temporary commissioner.

"He's a retired CEO," he said. "He certainly has the knowledge. He's respected. He's a consensus- builder type of personality. We needed someone with the leadership abilities and the time."

Pensacola lawyer M.J. Menge, a longtime community activist, said any concerns about Barnhart keeping up because of his age are misplaced.

"I play golf with him, and he surely doesn't act like he's 80 years of age," Menge said. "He stays up with what's going on and is very interested in the community."

Barnhart, who spent his working life in journalism, moved to Pensacola in 1978 as publisher of the News Journal and remained here after retirement in 1984.

Barnhart's son, Scott, also has Republican political connections that may have helped his father.

The younger Barnhart worked as an aide to former U.S. Sen. Connie Mack, the Republican from Florida, and now works as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Former District 1 Commissioner Wilson Robertson was the other top contender for the seat.

Robertson did not seek re-election in 2000 because of his wife's poor health. But she is better, and he was willing to bring his experience back to the temporary slot.

But Nickelsen and Menge, a Democrat with many contacts among Bush's advisers, said the governor made it clear early that he was not going to pick a former commissioner.

"The local advisers told the governor that Wilson Robertson was just as acceptable, but they also said they were fully supportive of Cliff Barnhart," Menge said.

Nickelsen said Bush also received several e-mails from local residents who felt that Robertson, while he has never been associated with scandal or wrongdoing, represents the commission's old guard.

"I'm glad they didn't go with Wilson," said Ann Sanborn, who attends most commission meetings. "He's a nice guy, but it's more of the same."

State Rep. Jerry Maygarden said that Eugene Franklin, owner of Franklin Mortgage & Investment Co., also got a serious look. In 1998, the Pensacola Area Chamber of Commerce honored his firm as the Minority Business of the Year.

"The governor wanted diversity," Maygarden said. "So all of the African-American candidates were looked at carefully. The recommendations concerned his work in the Chamber of Commerce and his personal business background."


Military and education


Wright, who rose to vice admiral during his Navy career, was an early favorite for the District 2 slot held by Bass.

He retired as chief of the Naval Education and Training Command at Pensacola Naval Air Station in 1996 and immediately made himself a big part of the civilian world.

He is associate director of the University of West Florida Institute of Human and Machine Cognition, the cutting-edge research center that studies improving human performance through computer applicatios.

Republican leaders have called upon Wright before for short-term projects:

Last year, Escambia School Superintendent Jim Paul selected him as chairman of a 10-member panel to study school closures and consolidations. Although the committee recommended cuts that would have freed $2 million for teacher raises, the School Board bypassed most of its recommendations.

In 1997, then-U.S. Rep. Joe Scarborough appointed Wright to a commission to study TRICARE, the military's managed health-care program.

Last year, Wright was one of 46 applicants for the University of West Florida's board of trustees. Bush did not select him for that position.

"Admiral Wright truly is a leader," said Menge, who was chairman of the Chamber of Commerce's armed services committee when the admiral was at the Naval Air Station. "He has a personality that commands respect. He's got good judgment. I've also found him to be very receptive to different ideas."

Menge has no doubt Wright will shed his admiral's stars in a district that is rich with military retirees who have listened to admirals all their lives.

"I think the citizens are going to put aside his former position and see how he deals with issues that come before the county today," he said.

Former state Rep. Lois Benson, who chaired the TRICARE commission, also was a contender for the District 2 site. But she was hurt by the fact that she has lost races for Congress, the state Senate and Pensacola mayor.

"The governor just decided he wasn't going to put someone in office the voters had rejected before," Nickelsen said.

State Rep. Jerry Maygarden said Roger MacDonald, the retired owner of Manpower temporary services, also was considered.

"He had all the right business experience and skill," he said.


Crossing party lines


In choosing Young to replace Junior in the majority-Democratic District 3, Bush elected to cross party lines.

Republican Ulysses Hughes, a well-regarded educator, was another top contender.

He is administrator of the Ruby Gainer Charter School, a cause dear to Bush's heart. He also served 31 years in the Escambia School District before retiring as assistant superintendent in 1991.

He also was on the steering committee that helped elect Superintendent Paul. Later, Paul drew criticism from some Republican quarters by selecting Democrat Norm Ross as his assistant superintendent rather than bringing back Hughes.

It was Nickelsen who asked Young to apply for the commission slot.

Comfortable on the City Council, the thought had not occurred to her.

She had planned to run next November for a final, two-year term on the City Council. But, since her County Commission stint most likely will expire in 2004, it also fit in with her plans.

"I had time to pray over it and talk it through with my husband," she said.

She agreed to apply. But when Bush actually tapped her, she was surprised.

"He's smart to put a Democrat in," she said. "I thought he was on the other side of the fence, but I have a lot of confidence in him now."

Katie Holmes, secretary of the Northwest Florida Young Democrats, said Young's selection is a relief.

"Our biggest concern was making sure District 3 was dealt with fairly," she said. "And the only fair thing in that district would be to appoint a Democrat."

Nickelsen said Young's selection should not have been a surprise, even though Hughes also is well-qualified.

"That district has elected a Democrat for 16 years," he said. "The governor wanted to pick people who are reflective of the district. He wasn't going to ram down his choices."

Nickelsen also said Young's reputation is impeccable.

"She personifies Christianity," he said. "She's steadfast in what she believes."

Mike Wiggins, who serves on the City Council with Young, called her "a magnificent lady and a superb public servant."

Her strength, he said, is building bridges.

"She's a peacemaker," he said. "I think she has the ability to effect a compromise when many think a compromise is not possible. Everyone walks away feeling good."

Maygarden said Bush was well aware of Young's talents in that regard.

"She has demonstrated to the community that she's a coalition builder," Maygarden said. "She's not on the fringe anywhere. She's got a lot of talent that's under the surface. I don't think she gets enough credit."


Political bridge-builder


In District 5, there was no contest over Gilley's selection to replace Smith.

Gilley has been an aide to Maygarden for seven years, currently working as staff director of the House Majority Office.

In 1999, when Escambia School Board member Vanette Webb was charged with breaking the public records law and suspended, Bush appointed Gilley to fill her spot. She served five months.

Maygarden said Bush didn't know Gilley well when he appointed her to the School Board but was comfortable she would do a good job.

"She really did do a good job, and I think that elevated her in the governor's eyes a whole lot," Maygarden said. "He would have been hard-pressed not to pick her again."

Nickelsen agreed.

"Why not go back to the well?" he said.

Maygarden can't say enough positive things about Gilley, particularly in her desire to help people.

"Aside from having a very outgoing, warm and cordial personality, she's the epitome of Will Rogers: She never met a stranger," he said. "She's very sincere in her effort to be helpful and supportive to constituents."

Gilley, like Young, also has a reputation as an easy-to-work- with bridge-builder.

"Janice is very good at making everybody get along," said Republican activist Jeanne Godwin, another local adviser to Bush. "She does not have an ego that gets in the way. She's fair and objective, and she builds a cohesive, unified feeling in a group."

The fact that Bush selected two women for the board also draws praise.

"Hooray," said Ellen Roston, president of the League of Women Voters of the Pensacola Bay Area.

The two women's political backgrounds are an extra bonus.

"It's nice that Marie Young has had experience with the City Council and the same with Janice Gilley with the Legislature," Roston said. "I like to see people coming in with some experience."

Nickelsen said the thing that the new appointees have in common is a willingness to serve community interests above their own.

"There's honesty and integrity among all of them," he said, "and that's certainly what we're looking for."

Subject:	Chistine (Kirsty) Edwards

Governor Bush,
 
I am writing to you on behalf of a learning disabled student whose family are my clients.  I first became an education consultant/advocate because it was so difficult to get an appropriate education for my own disabled children that I knew average parents could never make it through our education system.  After 13 years' experience at it, I know that even outstanding, highly educated parents often can't use the system as it is designed to be used.  Kirsty's family is the perfect example.
 
Kirsty Edwards is a learning disabled student who is consistently an A-B student in the honors curriculum at the Visual and Performing Arts Theatre Magnet at Dr. Phillips High School in 
Orlando, Florida.  Despite everything her parents have done, despite all my efforts in her behalf, the Department of Education of the State of Florida itself stands in the way of Kirsty getting the diploma she is working so hard to earn.  
 
Florida's Department of Education in its wisdom put together a list of "acceptable" accommodations for standardized testing that is so limited that many students may not be able to have the accommodations they need to pass the HSCT or FCAT.  DOE insists that only one or two students have requested to have accommodations not on that list.  I maintain that is because parents are not educated by Florida's schools to know they SHOULD request accommodations during testing, much less accommodations other than what are on the list.  I also believe that to use any such list is discriminatory, since no list can contain all the possible variations of accommodations a student might require for appropriate testing.  Denying a student any accommodation he/she needs to have equal opportunity to show on a test what he/she has learned is discriminatory, and Florida is doing it consistently with HSCT and FCAT testing.
 
It is only after months of effort that we discovered the procedure for getting a waiver to the FCAT, and even with Kirsty's history, we can not be certain she will be given the waiver.  Only one thing is certain.  If she is not given the waiver, Kirsty's future in Florida is the same as any dropout who does not know a third of what she knows and has never applied himself/herself to any study endeavor.  
 
There is a bill before the legislature now to allow standardized testing to be given with any/all accommodations listed on the students' IEPs.  That bill is far less discriminatory than what exists now, because what exists now is pure discrimination and nothing less.  I do not recall at this moment if the bill would allow accommodations listed on disabled students Section 504 Accommodation Plans, but if it does not, it must be amended to do so.  
 
Given that the State already has a contingent of people who realize the discriminatory nature of the FCAT accommodations list and are seeking to change our procedures to something more ethical and legal, it would not be inappropriate for you to use your gubernatorial discretion to request an exemption from the FCAT for any disabled students who require accommodations currently not appearing on that list if the students' academic records show the students obviously meet all other requirements for a diploma.  Surely you must be able to appoint a small committee of people to examine academic records and conduct quick interviews of school staff to determine whether disabled students who can't pass the HSCT/FCAT are otherwise fully qualified to hold Florida diplomas so these students could be exempted from the HSCT/FCAT process. Would you check to see if you can use your authority in that way for these students until more appropriate accommodations are available to them?  
 
You call yourself the Education Governor.  Quite frankly, I think it would be embarrassing to have to explain how you are our "Education Governor" if you could not move DOE's heaven and earth to allow qualified students to have the diplomas they have earned.  There simply must be something you can do, since denying good students diplomas would be a blemish on the honor of our State.  I believe this denial could also open the State to possible lawsuits alleging discrimination against disabled students.  Since the list is clearly discriminatory and no one disagrees with that, it defies reason to understand why it has not been replaced with non-discriminatory procedures, and such adherence to obvious discriminatory procedures practically begs for lawsuits.  I do my best to find alternative strategies for parents to use, but in this case....we really need you to use your Education-ness in our students' behalf.
 
Kirsty Edwards has requested to meet with you when you visit her school on May 14.  I am requesting that when you speak with her, if only for 5 minutes, please let her know whether you have the power to intervene for her and other students in her situation, and let her know what you or someone else can do to help.  
 
I will appreciate anything you can do to help Kirsty and other disabled students like her.  
 
Sincerely,
 
Michele Williams

Jeb, this is a draft only, it is really worth the read.  This is what I
want you to joint announce with ACSI.  It is good for Florida education
(ACSI now has 350 schools in Florida).  Tentatively, will you consider a
joint announcement of this PILOT program with ACSI sometime the end of
May?  See below: frank
Dear Administrator,                    May 2002
The Florida Region is pleased to announce the ACSI/United Christian
Giving (UCG) Teacher of the Year Program which will begin this coming
fall.  The program will recognize, honor and award three teachers from
our region for their contributions to Christian education and their
Godly impact on the lives of students and parents.
ACSI has always had the goal of equipping teachers and schools to
minister more effectively for the Lord.  We believe this program will
allow us to honor fine Christian educators in our state and will serve
as an encouragement to other teachers.  These Teacher of the Year
winners will be asked to represent Christian edcuation no only at their
own school but also as an ambassador for the Lord throughout the region.
We are asking each school administrator to review the staff of their
school and nominate those teachers who best exemplify the Lord Jesus
Christ and solid Christian philosophy of education. These teachers will
then fill out the application form and attach the other required
documentation (Administrative Questionaire, support letters, school
recommendation letter and videotape).  These materials should be sent to
the Florida regional office by September 3, 2002, where they will be
reviewed by a selection committee.  The committee will then select three
teachers (one each from the early education, elementary and secondary
levels) as the ACSI/UCG Florida Teacher of the Year.  The awards wil be
presented at the Florida Teachers Convention on November 25-26, 2002 in
Orlando.
We are especially thankful for the support of United Christian Giving, a
non-profit foundation in the Ft Myers area.  United Christian Giving is
made up of Christian business men and women who are supportive of
numerous ministry opportunities.  The foundation has pledged to give
each Teacher of the Year a $2,500. cash gift along with a $1,000. cash
gift to that teacher's school.
We look forward to your participation in this program.  If you have any
questions, please feel free to contact us.  May the Lord bless you as
you faithfully serve Him.
In His Service,
David M. Ray
Florida Regional Director (ACSI)

Governor,

 

You wanted to know my suggestion on how I would deal with the issue of the single-insured in the new Healthcare Plan.

 I will try to be brief.  But since this is not my area of expertise, I may be a trifle long...please bear with me.

 

I have briefly scanned through SB 46-I Health Care bill, mainly the "clean claim" section, the pilot health flex plan and the single insured provision.  

 

Since I view the primary reason for higher medical premiums almost exclusively on uncontrolled medical costs, forcing carriers to pay medical providers before a clean claim will simply allow the medical industry to gouge the consumer even more.  The clean claim proviso will make it even harder for carriers to hold down medical costs, or even develop an incentive to do so.

 

Governor, I am a court reporter. All I do all day long is take EUOs (examination under oaths) and IMEs (independent medical examination) testimony. Under our present structure there is no incentive for medical providers to cut costs. And as long as the insurance industry can simply go to the state and raise premiums to meet rising costs, they will not play their natural and vital role in reducing costs -- that leaves the consumer virtually powerless and defenseless. We should be passing laws that strengthen the insurance carrier's hands in making sure these medical costs are reasonable, necessary and affordable.  The mere fact that insurance carriers are not asking the Legislature for more tools to address rising medical costs tells me the direction of this bill is headed in the wrong direction.

 

The health flex pilot plan is designed to help provide medical coverage for the uninsured whose family gross income equals to or less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level, about $30,000 per year. I make around $60,000 a year, gross. I pay about $800 per month in medical coverage for my wife, daughter and myself. This amount is due to go up to $890 next year. I will not be able to afford 150 percent increase on this amount. I also will not qualify for your health flex plan at present, neither will a lot of other one-life groups. There is at present no safety net for us. The health flex plan must be far more developed to insure that no one is singled out to carry an unfair burden or be left behind.

 

That leaves me with the single insured issue. I have nothing against joining a larger consumer group if the transition is seamless and harmless. I see nothing in this bill that assures me that bringing one-lifers into a larger consumer pool will be a simple matter of paperwork. I have paid into my present medical coverage for the past 15 years with very little medical expense. At my age, I am not a very good prospect to a new insurance carrier and would be an enticing target to jettison by my insurance carrier if given half a chance. The law must ensure the pooling of one-life groups is carried out in a transparent and professional manner.

 

Yes, Governor, there are good provisions in this bill, and insurance reform is needed. But this bill is premature in its design and puts people at risk needlessly. 

 

I know you will do your best to do what is right, as you have done before. But no irreversible harm will come from putting this reform bill off another year so adequate provisions can be made to protect all the people.

Governor,

I know you are very familiar with Sherry Friedlander and the "A child Is 
Missing" Program. The Legislature has been kind enough to continue funding 
the program for the following year in the amount of $100,000. in recurring 
funds. I hope you will consider continuing the funding as well.

We are in the process of working with Emergency Management to use the system 
for emergency call-outs for disasters, either natural or man made, 
throughout the state of Florida. I want to thank you for that as well.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Team---------We feel that Nelson's efforts are clearly political.  We talked
to his staff almost daily last week and no one mentioned the e-mail letter;
of course they sent it through "standard processes" as opposed to delivering
directly to Governor or us----the Gov gives his e-mail address to the world!
Nelson should have it.

We have a call in for Bryant Hall, Graham's LD to see what Daschle may be
telling Graham about amendments. We also have left a message for our WH
contacts.

We spoke w/ USTR contacts this morning.  A deal has been cut and Daschle and
Lott will be opposing all amendments.  USTR anticipates heavy debate Wed and
Thurs w/ hopes of a vote on Thursday.

We also spoke with Andy LaVigne who understands the current situation and
told us that he has talked to Graham and Nelson's staff and said, "If the
deal is cut, offer the amendment, talk about it, and withdraw it."  Andy
takes the view that if we push too hard, we/citrus will hurt ourselves in
future negotiations.

As soon as we have a few more pieces...we will call...to talk about whether
we respond in writing.  At this time, we feel that by responding we escalate
the political rhetoric.

Melissa is currently working on the Bacardi letter and we'll have that to
you later today for review.  Nina.

Nina, can you call Andy/Jennifer and find out what gives -- this is clearly
the broader amendment -- did Citrus just ignore our counsel? any
expectations subsequent to our conversations from last week?

Daschle and the White House have a deal -- so amendment just appears to be
going through the motions.

Option 1:  Do a letter back to the senators indicating support for tpa and
support for a narrower amendment that applies to citrus, reiterate that we
have contacted multiple parties on the issue, including grassley, and that
we will be involved in trade negotiations and looking out for florida's
interests.
Finally, expose Nelson in letter for his true intentions.

Option 2: Ignore the letter -- it is political and nothing else.  If asked
by reporters, we can state the above.

Dear Governor Bush:

We are writing to seek your partnership in a matter of vital importance to
the Florida citrus industry.  We are contacting you by e-mail because our
efforts to reach you by telephone late last week were unsuccessful.

In preparation for the Senate's final consideration of the Trade Promotion
Authority bill, we drafted an amendment that would help ensure the Florida
citrus industry is afforded fair treatment in future trade agreements.  In
essence, our amendment would prevent any negotiated reduction in the tariff
on
Brazilian frozen concentrated orange juice from taking effect until the
Brazilian citrus industry ceases its unfair trade practices, specifically
dumping.

In crafting this amendment, we have consulted closely with Florida Citrus
Mutual, the Florida Department of Citrus and the Florida Department of
Agriculture and Consumer Services, and we are assured this language has
their
consensus support.  They and we agree our chances of success are maximized
by an
amendment that is broad enough to attract support from similarly situated
industries - and Senators from affected states.  That is why our amendment
would
benefit several other industries subject to unfair foreign competition, and
not
just the citrus industry.  The amendment is attached below for your review.

In response to our calls to you, we received a memo from your staff
informing us of your office's activities in support of the citrus industry.
The
memo indicates that, while your staff has had recent discussions with their
counterparts in the Administration and in Congress, your last conversations
with
Administration officials were in February.

Now, with the bill on the Senate floor, we have spoken to dozens of our
colleagues, as well to numerous senior Administration officials, on behalf
of
this crucial amendment. We have no doubt that you are an influential voice
with
this Administration and invite you to join our efforts to help Florida's
citrus
growers by seeking the support of the White House for the amendment.  A
signal
from the White House that this amendment has its support could deliver
enough
Republican Senators' votes to ensure its passage.

Furthermore, we urge that you personally contact Senator Charles Grassley,
the
Ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, to request specifically
that
he support our amendment to the Trade Promotion Authority bill.  Senator
Grassley can be reached at (202) 224-3744.

Please call us at your first available opportunity to discuss our
cooperative
efforts and strategy to help our citrus growers.  For Senator Graham, call
(202)
224-3041, or for Senator Nelson, call (202) 224-5274.

Sincerely,


Bob Graham                              Bill Nelson

Governor Bush,
   I urge you to allow passage of CS/SB160. This bill will secure more protection for the racing greyhounds in Florida. I currently work at Daytona Beach Kennel Club which has an addoption service for retired dogs. All dogs that are retired from this facility go through the adoption process. This bill would make this required at all tracks. 
  This bill would also allow increased stakes at the poker games attached to these tracks. These increased stakes would not create "high stakes" poker in any sense of the meaning of high stakes. However it would make a much more enjotable game for our customers. This in turn would increase the taxes collected by the state which could be put to good use educating our children along with the state operated lottery.
  Not allowing this bill to pass would certainly lead to higher unemolyment as track workers are laid off or terminated due to lack of support. Please lets not add to the States reputation where turtles are protected and children are lost and forgotten. Lets do all we can to better educate our children and keep their parents employed. This bill will help accomplish this in a small way. If we all work together maybe we can find other ways as well.

Honorable Governor: 
Sometimes the best efforts and well intended projects fail due to the fact that the people designated to inquire, evaluate and possibly make recommendations on a very sensitive issue, as the one in question may be the best on paper. 
However, these people are so detached from reality that their learning on issues of children's needs, mostly needy children from ghetto homes, whose head of family is a female resulting from a broken home or some socially related problem, comes from books and reports that are or have been on file for quite some time without any action by anyone. 
I believe that for such a panel to succeed it needs participation and input from one or two persons at the grass roots levels, who can talk about reality and apply factual information, not that which has been produced to satisfy the system, to the final report in order for it to satisfy the needs that years of decay and carelessness have developed. 
These grandiose persons are very much detached from the levels from which the children in question turn into victimes of a system that has not worked for decades. 
Back when I was a police officer in New York City they had what was known as the Bureau of Child Welfare.  It was a bust.  When we ran into an incident involving such children, most of the time we had to carry the ball all the way through.  They were not qualified, inept, insensitive to the needs of such children, not well trained and undermanned. Their only reason for beding there ws to get a check, fringe benefits and a pension down the road. 
They, as well as here, falsified reports, filed fradulent vouchers, and mostly were afraid to enter certain neighborhoods in order to perform at expected levels. 
Florida is no different. Take case workers from certain areas and have them tailed for a few weeks and then check the reports filed and you will learn that the above is true. 
High society people are not in tune with the happenings and their final analysis is accepted and put to work and ends up failing again and again. 
I know you never get to read this messages.  That is a shame.  There are more average people with better ideas on how to handle matters of such sensitivity that are never heard for the assignments always go to elitist individuals who have never been nor will ever be in the pit with the alligators. 
Have a good one and good luck.

Jeb, thanks again for your generous gift of your time and the mansion.  
One quick deal:  for a handful of years the state budget has included
the
$17,000 necessary for DMS to hire a part-time OPS employee to staff and
support the Statewide FSECC Steering Committee.  This year, the
committee
has outsourced that job (with encouragement from DMS) to us.  The Senate
had
the $17,000 in their budget.  The House didn't.  It has come and gone
and
then come and gone.  I'm not sure where things are right now.  Colleen
is
working on making sure the $17,000 DOES happen.  She is obviously part
of
the Steering Committee that voted unanimously for the $17,000 to be
included
in the state's budget.  Otherwise, it will have to come from employees'
gifts (or United Way budgets).  Colleen and I spoke today, and we
figured I
ought to just send you a quick email underlining how important it
is--and
thanking you and her for putting in a good word for its inclusion.  Of
course it's not very much money--but it would hit some United Way
budgets
pretty hard.  AND it pays for the actual work that the Steering
Committee
does in setting up the campaign.  That's the reason the committee (and
Colleen) feel that it should be in the state budget again as it has been
ever since you became Governor.  Thanks for putting in a good word
wherever
it would help.  Ken

Spoke with executive director of Health Families
 
Here's the news -- in 1997 Healthy Families was in 6 counties with ZERO state funding.  
 
In 1998/99 it jumped to 10m in state funding and serving 1890 families -- this was a direct result of our child welfare initiative and call to expand.  In years following, program expanded futher with a recurring base of 22.2m.  
 
This has enabled the program to serve 6,100 families in 99/00, 10,022 families in 00/01, and 11,000 families this year -- base is still 22.2m.  
 
What has changed is non-recurring $$ that they used to supplement base -- the non recurring, which is lower this upcoming year means that they will probably not get up to 11,000 families this upcoming year -- BUT NO FAMILIES that are currently receiving services will be cut, just they will not have as many families coming on line -- Healthy Families is just trying to more prudently spend its non-recurring so that they do not over extend with one time money -- next year, they will seek more recurring.

Attached is a chronology of events leading to the letter you received. It
appears this MCOC is frustrated by lack of cooperation it gets from HMOs
when trying to resolve consumer issues. They are probably competing with
statewide provider and subscriber assistance panel that also exists to
resolve disputes with HMOs.

My Chair, Dr. Ken Kiehl, has asked that I forward this letter to you.
Sincerely yours, Pauline Chusid, MD, FACP, MBA

        25 April 2002

Ken Kiehl, M.D., Chairman,
District 8 Managed Care Ombudsman Committee
1430 Hillview Drive
Sarasota, FL 34239

Dear Ken:
 After much soul searching, I have decided to resign from the District 8
Managed Care Ombudsman Committee.  I am resigning because I have come to
believe that the Ombudsman Committee actually shields Governor Jeb Bush
from the critical attention his administration deserves for its managed
care policies and performance.
 He has failed to make any real effort to protect Florida citizens from
managed care company abuses, and uses our committee to deflect
criticism.  If we on the committee manage to help someone get his or her
health care needs covered, it is all well and good.  But our committee
has discovered a pattern of bad faith abuses by two large managed care
organizations, and ACHA has failed to act.  So some policyholders have
had their care needlessly delayed or denied, despite our efforts.
 I see this pattern of non action by the Bush administration as enabling
the systemic abuses to continue.  As other managed care organizations
learn that the bad faith abuses are permitted to continue without
sanction, then they, too, will cease to cooperate with our committee.
 But as long as our committee exists, Governor Jeb Bush can point to us
and pretend he is working to protect Florida's citizens.  It is a sham.
He failed to respond to two emails I sent to him on this subject.
 Therefore, I am resigning from the District 8 Managed Care Ombudsman
Committee effective immediately.  I am glad I have been able to help a
handful of people.  I am grateful that being on this committee has
allowed me to meet several caring and committed fellow committee
members.  Maybe in the future we will be able to work together again, on
a project with more chance of success.
 Thank you for you attention and your efforts.


        Sincerely,

Subject:	RE: Dog bill (card room bill; adoption bill)

The question in my mind is whether this is "maintenance of a product" or "improving a product" -- by making it more attractive, more lucrative, are we encouraging the behavior.   From what i know about this bill, it will make it more attractive, more lucrative and encourage that particular behavior, so in that sense i think it is improving the product.  as such, i do believe it is an expansion of gaming taking us ever closer, bit by bit, inch by inch to full scale level 3 casino gaming. 
 
rationalizing this bill is fine, but in the end it creates more loopholes that lead to more bills that will force us to do more rationalization.   
 
and yes, we inherited legalized forms of gaming, but it is not necessarily our job to keep them on life support, or revise them every few years to keep them lucrative.

Governor: 

Thanks for lunch the other day.  I really enjoyed our conversation.  I also appreciate your taking my call later that day.

I have been thinking about the above-referenced legislation and understand that you will get it next week.  I know that at least one of the issues that you and your staff will deliberate on is whether or not this bill constitutes an expansion of gambling.  I wanted to give you one last thought on that from my perspective as to why I believe the bill does not constitute an expansion of gambling.

The expansion of gambling took place when the original card room legislation was enacted--not within this bill.  This previous legislation added card rooms as another product that could be offered by the pari-mutuel operators.  The Legislature has now determined that that product is faulty, does not work properly, and needs to be adjusted.  The bill adjusts the operational aspects of the product and allows it to function as intended by the original legislation.  You inherited this and other forms of gaming that are legal.  You can choose to pursue a course of repealing the legislation authorizing this and other gaming, or you can take steps to make currently authorized activity work as intended without expanding the offerings.  To adopt a position that maintenance of a specific existing product constitutes expanding that product, in my opinion does not seem to be an appropriate policy position.  This policy position would seem particularly troublesome when you look at other legal gaming products such as the lottery, which also existed before your term and whose operations have been allowed to be adjusted in a similar fashion to what this legislation proposes. 

In summary, I believe this bill is not an expansion but a necessary adjustment to an existing product.  I hope this helps.  Let me know if I can do anything else.  

Thanks for your friendship.

Thanks for sharing this email.  I was impressed with Dan when I met him last year.  It's basically the "girl-scout cookie" model of social service - the social service provider has a business that helps fund the provision of services (just like the sale of girl scout cookies funds the operations of the girls scouts). 

Governor, when the time comes, I am interested in helping you identify some outside-the-box thinking, change-agent champions to recruit who can continue in the all-too-important effort to continuously challenge the status quo and resist the siren songs of the bureaucratic blob.

I certainly appreciate the fact that you were under water restrictions

water.  I have instructed the staff overseeing the Shade Florida
voucher
program to re-issue a card and send it out immediately.  I hope this

Thank you for your cooperation in the citrus canker eradication

contact me.
Sincerely,

This is the student who wants to take "memory cards" into the testing
situation.  The memory cards will show complete solutions to various types
of math problems.  This is not allowed.

Dear Governor Bush,
My name is Christine Edwards.  My parents have written to you many times

regarding their concerns for my future.  However, I would like to share
with 
you my concerns about my future. As of May 24, 2002, I will be a senior
in 
the Visual and Performing Arts Theatre Magnet at Dr. Phillips High
School in 
Orlando, Florida.  I am an honors student with learning disabilities.  I

have dreamt of attending college to pursue my dreams and enhance my 
education since I was a little girl.  However, it doesn't look like I
will 
have that  opportunity in the state of Florida.  I will not graduate
next 
May with my diploma, nor my peers, nor the VPA seal that I have earned 
because, although I have taken the math section of the FCAT three times,
I 
cannot pass it without the use of my accommodations.  I have been denied
the 
use of those accommodations during that last 3 attempts.  Because of
those 
denials, my anxiety has only gotten worse creating an even more
stressful 
situation while taking the test.

I have never been allowed to use any of my Section 504 accommodations, 
including my right to test privately. The FCAT has sealed my fate and 
decided my future. I have a severe anxiety disorder known as Obsessive 
Compulsive Disorder and a learning disorder known as Non Verbal Learning

Disorder that both severely impact my ability for recall.   Each time I
have 
taken the math section of the FCAT without my accommodations and failed,
my 
symptoms have become worse. I have panic attacks just thinking about the

FCAT and my future without a college degree. I worry about not receiving
my 
diploma and the impact that alone will have on my future.  Numerous
times,I 
have made myself ill with worry.  There is no logical reason for me not
to 
pass the FCAT, other than my disabilities. I have met the Sunshine State

Standards required to graduate with a standard high school diploma,
except 
for passing the FCAT. My math teachers from the last 3 years in high
school 
are writing our Superintendent of Schools to ask him to request a waiver
for 
me from the State of Florida's Department of Education, because my 
disabilities won't permit me to pass the FCAT math section. I can't
benefit 
from the FCAT now, after 3 failed attempts, and the State won't benefit
from 
my taking it. The State of Florida has all but guaranteed that I will
never 
graduate with a standard diploma and I will be left behind, despite 
President Bush's Education initiative.

I need your help. Please help me. I need you to intervene on my behalf.
I 
need an FCAT math section waiver.  I want the future I am entitled to
have.  
I have worked hard for almost 12 years to keep my grades high, I have
put in 
many long hours studying and building bridges over my disabilities. I
have 
been an exemplary student. Because I have such trouble taking tests due
to 
the impact of my disability on my ability to recall, I won't be awarded
any 
scholarships to help pay for any further education, even though I have
met 
the criteria with community service, course work and grades. The fact
is, I 
don't test well due to my disabilities and I am being punished by the
State 
because of it.

I want to be a productive member of my community and my country. Without
a 
high school diploma, I cannot have a college education, a dream or a
future. 
  Without a college education, I am doomed to low paying jobs and no 
opportunities to further enhance my education or reach my goals.  I will
be 
a child left behind. Please help me.

I found out today that you will be visiting my high school next Tuesday,
May 
14, 2002 during 5th and 6th period.  I would love the opportunity to
meet 
you in person and talk with you regarding my concerns not only for
myself 
but for the future of all disabled students in the state of Florida.
Thank 
you for taking the time to read my letter.

Sincerely,
Christine "Kirsty" Edwards
Student, Dr. Phillips High School
Visual and Performing Arts Theatre Magnet
Orlando, Florida

Saturday, May 11, 2002

Vieques move no bomb for Tyndall, says Boyd
"ON THE SAME PAGE": Congressman feels details have been worked out to keep
base's mission safe.

KENDALL MIDDLEMAS
The News Herald 
News that a portion of the U.S. Navy's training mission on Vieques Island,
Puerto Rico, might be reassigned to Eglin Air Force Base generally has been
regarded as a potential boon for Northwest Florida's military installations.

But U.S. Rep. Allen Boyd, D-Monticello, wants to be sure that the training,
which includes bombing exercises and aerial combat training, would not
interfere with Tyndall Air Force Base's use of the airspace known as the
Gulf Range Complex. 
Boyd said that a meeting earlier this week with Adm. Robert Natter,
commander of the Navy's Atlantic Fleet, "allayed a lot of the anxiety" he
had about a possible threat to Tyndall's mission. 
"I think that everybody's on the same page," Boyd said. "I'm very encouraged
that this thing's going to work out." 
Eglin handles scheduling in the Gulf Range airspace, but Tyndall is its
primary user. Tyndall's F-15 pilots spend 245 days a year training in the
Gulf Range. That accounts for about 90 percent of the airspace scheduling
capacity, Boyd said. 
"The unrestricted use and access to the Gulf Range airspace complex is
critical to Tyndall's ability to accomplish its mission," said Capt. Chris
Karns, chief public affairs officer for the 325th Fighter Wing at Tyndall.
"The Gulf Range complex is a national defense treasure critical to training
our pilots and ensuring they have the knowledge, skills and experience to
fight and win America's wars. We need to ensure to the maximum extent
possible that the objectives of all potential Department of Defense users
are able to be met, and at the same time make sure current missions are not
negatively impacted." 
Boyd said his meeting with Natter was a "very positive conversation," and he
is now comfortable that any plans to reassign the Vieques mission to Eglin
will take Tyndall's needs into account. 
"Adm. Natter and the Navy have got a clear understanding of what we're
trying to do," he said. 
U.S. Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Chumuckla, has been a proponent of bringing the
Vieques mission to Eglin, which falls within his 1st Congressional District.

While there is "a strong consideration for some participation in the
Panhandle," Miller said Eglin likely would assume only a portion of the
mission, thereby decreasing the chances for interference with Tyndall's
training schedule. Bases in other parts of Florida and up the East Coast
likely will absorb some of the Vieques mission, Miller said. 
"There is no plan to move all the Vieques mission to the gulf," he said. 
And, Miller said, plans are only in their earliest stage. As they progress,
issues like shared airspace will be discussed, he said. 
"There is still a large amount of dialogue and planning that needs to be put
into place," Miller said. "I feel those issues will have to be addressed and
resolved as this proposal moves forward." 
Miller said he supports the relocation of the Vieques training to the
Panhandle because he believes it would be an asset to existing bases and
missions. 
"The idea is to strengthen the military installations in West Florida, not
weaken them," he said. "My desire is to strengthen the military bases
throughout the Panhandle." 
Larry Dantzler, president of the Bay Defense Alliance, said the Navy
received a warm reception from Eglin when it raised the possibility of
conducting some of the Vieques training there. 
"Only now have they realized the involvement of Tyndall in the area," he
said. "Tyndall's missions had not really been considered." 
Boyd said the protection of Tyndall's access to the Gulf Range is especially
critical as another round of base closures approaches. If Tyndall's pilots
cannot stick to the strict schedule required to graduate them to
fighter-pilot status, the base might be an easier target. 
"That's why we have to keep our shoulder to the wheel on this," he said. 
But Boyd agreed with Miller that if properly planned, the relocation of some
of the Vieques mission to Northwest Florida could be an asset when area
bases come under scrutiny in 2005. 
"If we get this done right it will be another feather in our cap," he said.

Hi Pam -- as you know there are a lot of issues such as the 30 days
visas impacting Florida's int'l trade and commerce right now.  We are
putting together an inventory of such issues to present to our Executive
Committee next week. When the document is ready, I will be happy to send
you a copy along with a letter sent to INS re: 30 days visas. We are
trying to do as much as we can to mitigate the impact that these new
rules can have on our economy by communicating with the Gov't and with
the public. However, we may have to live with some of them -- at least
for the time being. The Chamber is very proactive and we keep an open
line of communication with INS. We meet monthly with them and we have an
excellent working relationship. I believe that more public awareness and
education is needed so foreign tourists and businessmen are not driven
away.  I can do some of this through our website, missions and seminars
but more will be needed. We know that you are working hard on all these
issues and we want to thank you and the governor for your outstanding
support and leadership.

Dear Pam,

I pass this information along to you as "anecdotal" -- I don't know how
representative it is of a broader segment of travelers from Latin
America.

A colleague here in Miami has a friend in Latin America who is planning
to
take a two month vacation.  He would normally come to the US.  When
asked if
he would be coming through Miami, he said no, he just didn't need all
the
aggravation of trying to travel to Miami  - the Patriot Act, the INS,
etc.

He is not planning to travel to the United States at all, -- he will be
going to Spain and London.

CLARIFICATION RE Sarasota County tax - this changes the tax issues for
school construction back to 18 of 28 or 64% passing, but in any event it is
a tax for schools.
____________________________________________________________________________
_________________
YES, Sarasota did in fact pass a local ad valorem tax for operating purposes
for four years.  The additional tax is estimated to raise $100 million over
the 4 year period ($25 million yearly).

There are not bonds to be sold, nor is it a half-cent sales surtax.  It is
strictly an additional ad valorem tax for four years to support operations,
etc.  The vote passed district wide by a 2 to 1 margin.  

Since this is not a capital outlay issue, I will not include the information
in my capital outlay sheets.

If I can be of further assistance, please call me at 921-8699.

Trust this answers Brewsers question.

Again thanks for all you both do for the citizens of Florida.

since 1985.

Sarasota is most recent - last month, with over 70% voting for the tax with

Dear Governor Bush,
 
It was a pleasure seeing you several weeks ago at the ceremonial signing of the Fish and Wildlife bill. That was a winner for all involved parties. I received many accolades from the public on the Tampa Tribune coverage of the signing.
 
I would strongly encourage you to consider a town hall meeting here in Tampa. As you recall, I suggested this to you six months ago. Now with your campaign underway and the finish of the legislative session the timing would be excellent. I proposed to you that I would moderate a town hall meeting comprised of the most diversified group ever assembled in Hillsborough County. This would not be a speech, or a press conference but a progressive and positive forum in which citizens would speak to you on issues relevant to Hillsborough County. You would then make a closing statement.
 
I had lunch with Mr. Steve Weaver, publisher of the Tampa Tribune last week. In fact it was the same day you were to meet him in Tampa. He is very positive about this proposal and would lend great support. I also had the opportunity to attend a baseball game Friday night with Mr. Paul Tash, President of the St. Petersburg Times. He would also support such an endeavor.
 
I have and will always be a strong supporter of yours and I think you are off to a strong campaign start. Your many accomplishments in your first term speak for themselves.
 
Please give some thought to my suggestion, and let me know if you wish to pursue it. I believe it would be great for you and Hillsborough County.
 
Hope all is well with you and your family.
Kindest regards,

Subject: a case you might want somone to address

        
        Jeb, 
        I've been receiving email from a woman, Carolyn Thomas, whose teenage daughter is suffering an ongoing and terrible drug problem.

        She says she contacted you or your office a few times in 2000 and 2001 about her stepdaughter, Kristal Thomas, and what she views as a breakdown at Juvenile Justice. Lately, she says, she has written to you, but has been frustrated by the impersonality of auto-office replies.

        I don't know if this is a case you already have asked someone to inquire about, or if this is something you might want someone to check on,

        but I'm passing along a couple of letters she has shared with me for whatever help anyone can provide her. 
        She sounds very pained, her daughter very troubled. 
        Good luck for all involved, 
        Mark 
        
        (Her email address is: Carolyn Thomas [lynalen@earthlink.net] 
        and this is the address and phone on her correspondence:        Carolyn Thomas

Hello Governor:

I wanted to let you know how much we appreciated having your videotaped
greeting for the groundbreaking event for the new Midfield Terminal at
Southwest Florida International Airport today.  We had about 200 attendees,
including elected officials and business leaders from Collier, Lee and
Charlotte counties, and numerous guests commented that they were impressed
that you took the time to "participate" via video.  So thank you!

Hope all is well with you -- I'm sure you're glad that yet another special
session is done.  We really appreciate your support of the House's TOP
funding list, by the way, as there were several important projects from our
region.  (And what a great article about your Mom in Newsweek!  She's a
hoot.)

Best,
Tina

I just wanted to voice my concerns about HB1821, which I most definitely do not  want to pass, since this is the only united group that attempts to break down the barriers that stop or interfere with fathers having access to their children.  If this legislation is passed, then fathers in this state will not have a channel to voice their concerns about their time, or lack of time, with their children.

On the other hand, I would like to see legislation passed on HB 1312, which would help put more "teeth" in the Visitation Interference Act.  It will help with visitation issues that many a father has encountered.

Thanks for listening to my opinions,

Sincerely,

Anthony Smith

Jeb:

    In the next few days you are going to have the opportunity to support
line item # 2179 B ( Florida Venture Foundation ) this item will directly
impact our Hispanic Community in Miami Dade County.

We are 100 % in support of F.V.F. application, F.V.F. has also gather the
support of most of our civic organizations, like Camacol, S.A.L.A.D. UNIDOS,
and many others.

F.V.F. was created in the spirit of the ONE FLORIDA initiative, in which I
have been involve since date one.

This will be a unique and very successful concept never before experienced
in our community, this idea has already been proven worthy of doing in the
Afro- American community with who we plan to work very closely.

I am asking you to support this item when the new budget is presented to you
for a signature. If you have any questions please feel free to call me at
the Latin Builders Association ( 305 ) 446 - 5989 Ext 25 or at my cell (
305 ) 542 - 7406.

Thanks for listening.  W.J.D.

Subject:	3rd DCA ruling in Rilya's sister's case

Importance:	High

The 3rd DCA this afternoon denied DCF's petition to prohibit Judge Lederman
from holding a shelter hearing to determine whether DCF appropriately
removed Rodericka Wilson, Rilya's younger sister, from the home of Pamela
Graham/Geralyn Graham.  The shelter hearing is expected to go forward
tomorrow--what time, we don't know yet.

The appellate court's order simply denies DCF's efforts at this juncture in
the proceedings but leaves the door open for DCF to appeal any order Judge
Lederman may enter.  The 3d DCA did not in any way speak to the merits of
DCF's position that the lower court lacks statutory authority to approve or
disapprove DCF's changing a child's residence/caregiver if it sees fit to do
so.

Dear Governor Bush:  A few weeks ago, and at the suggestion of our mutual friend Billie Neese, I wrote you with a call for help.  My friend, Dr. Mike Verwest's wife is expecting their first born and she wanted her Colombian mother to come to help and visit.  You assigned Andreina Beilingen from your Miami office and it looks as if our efforts are beginning to produce results, the lady has an appointment in Bogota, Colombia for the 23d of May.
     I am sending Andreina a package of information on behalf of this lady and think that it would help a lot if your office send this package with a letter of "interest" to the Embassy in Bogota.   Every one that has been involved in this effort to bring Laura Verwest's mother for the birth (or shortly after) would be very grateful to you.

Just to provide a little more information on this topic - we have received and approved numerous budget amendments from many state agencies for additional releases of funds over and above the amounts we've been releasing monthly.  We have not denied any of the requests.  There have been a few times we've changed a requested amount but only with the concurrence of the agency when we were able to show them that the records show there was actually not a need for the additional release.
 
In addition to the June 18 release I mentioned earlier as the final one for the fiscal year, there will be another partial release on May 21.

 $11.4 Million Infrastructure Grants Awarded to Orlando
 International Airport



               Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta May 10 announced
               $11.4 million in federal grants for Orlando International
               Airport. A total of $6.4 million will be used to continue
               construction of the North Crossfield Taxiway.


               In addition, $5 million in federal funds are to be used to
               continue construction of a fourth runway at the airport. The
               Greater Orlando Aviation Authority is in the midst of a $1.2
               billion expansion program including a new air traffic
               control tower, a fourth runway, taxiways and other
               facilities that when completed will double the airport's
               capacity.

question.......can the State's Attorney not look into possible neglect 
charges against the employee who failed to properly perform her /his job?  
Maybe something similar to what happens in the LTC industry if a complaint of 
neglect is pursued......investigate the office, employee and insure there was 
no criminal action?  Perhaps if you took this direction it would support the 
rage for this innocent falling through the cracks and set a standard for

Dear Governor Bush,
 
It has recently come to my attention that you will be appointing a new Monroe County Commissioner to fill the vacating seat of Commissioner Nora Williams.  Further, that the name of Keith Douglass has been submitted to you as a possible choice to fill this unexpired term for the next four to five months.  I would like to submit this recommendation for Keith Douglass, as a way to help assist you in making that decision, and why in my opinion I think he would be the perfect person to appoint to this position.
 
I am a practicing architect in the Islamorada area for the last 18 years, having moved to the Florida Keys after living in Miami for the prior 25 years.  I have been quite active in the Florida Keys, especially Monroe County government, having served on the Monroe County Planning Commission and also having been the Chairman of the Monroe County Land Authority's Advisory Committee.  Currently, I'm still serving on two Monroe County committees.
 
Because of the relatively short term to be filled until the Fall elections, I believe we need to find someone who is well acquainted with the many complex issues still facing Monroe County government.  During this period will also be the difficult task of addressing the county's budget for the year 2003.  Trying to teach a "new" person how to be a commissioner & the myriad details before them during this short time frame, would leave that individual at an extreme disadvantage, and thusly the general public as well.  Attempting to grasp the many issues would be a very difficult at best, to be in any way effective during this period.  Keith Douglass was Nora Williams immediate predecessor on the Monroe County Commission and is very familiar with the issues currently being addressed.  In addition, Mr. Douglass, as a former commissioner, has gone through the budget approval process four times in the past and understands the intricacies involved in that process.  Knowing Keith Douglass for almost all of the approximately 12 years he has resided in the Florida Keys, I can't think of a more community minded individual who would be willing to step in and help his community, without being self-serving, and has the qualifications to lend serious, immediate impute during this short, but very important period.
 
I hope that in the best "short term" interests of Monroe County, you will very seriously consider Keith Douglass for this position.
 
Thank you.

Hello-
 
I don't know if you are closely following the Community College
Baccaclaureate Degree issue as I am sure you have many other things on
your plate. 
 
May I share with you my concern over the e-mail I received regarding
Secretary of Education Jim Horne's recommendations in regards to
community colleges offering baccalaureate degrees? I am concerned that
by extending funding for community colleges to offer baccalaureate
degrees just because they apply,  might undermine the vision your have
of the new education governance structure, still being formed.    I also
would like to suggest that based on current research, the teacher
shortage problem we have is not solely due to lack of teacher degree
programs.  Research would suggest that we have more than enough
qualified teachers in Florida, they choose not to work in their chosen
profession due to other circumstances.  Therefore, offering more degree
programs to generate more teachers might not be the answer.  It is a
complicated issue just as nursing is a complicated issue.  
 
I also am concerned about community colleges losing the focus of their
primary missions and of creating a tiered degree program ie: BS degrees
that don't articulate completely to 4 year institutions for master
degrees etc.
 
We have such a great opportunity to create a new education governance
structure based on your vision, it will take time to research best
practices and pull the best of the "best practices" together to
re-structure our current system into one that is student focused and
seamless.  
 
I would be interested in your comments if you have seen the memo from
Secretary Horne.
 
 
I'm glad you had a nice day on Sunday.

Honorable Governor Bush.   Ron levy here, former mayor and elected offfical
from Islamorada.  We met a few months ago in your office when i had the
courage to ask you (not you,you -- but you,the State) for a 30 million
principal deferred loan for wastewater.  It was a great pleasure.  And while
it didn't work out, thanks so much for you attention to the issue.

I'm writing now to ask your strong consideration for appointing John Verdon
for Nora Williams seat.  I ask this first because of Mr. Verdon's
experience.  He has elected official experience as a moyor in Michigan ( i
think elected 4 times ).  He has worked very diligently on Islamorada's
Wastewater committiee.  He listens to all sides of issues and then makes
thoughtful decisions which he can clearly articulate.    Another reason is
that John is a resident of Islamorada.  and while technically Nora's
district goes down into Marathon, Marathon is already represented by George
Nugent, who has interests in Marathon.  The other names I have heard
considered for this seat live in Marathon, and have little connection to the
great majority of Nora's district.  I believe this seat has always in recent
history been occupied by a Islamorada resident.  A third reason is that Mr
Verdon is independent of any old MonCo politics and would work for the  good
of all the citizens of the Keys.

Thanks for your time on this mattter, and all your work for the State of
Florida.  I really enjoyed ( and miss)  my years of  public service for
Islamorada -- if I can be of any further help, please let me know.
Sincerely, Ron Levy

Chief, I know that I may be barking up the wrong tree, but I have a suggestion that I humbly would like to make.  I know that we have been having difficulty finding someone to fill the STO's CIO position.  
 
I know that we need someone who is loyal, knows something about IT and high tech industry in Florida, is familiar with government's procurement process, has a working knowledge of both the legislative process and your vision for the STO, has credibility with the legislature, can be supportive of the high tech industry in Florida, and wants to make a difference.  I suggest Chris Hart.
 
I know that he hung up his spurs today because he wants to spend more time with his family, but I know that he would be willing to serve if he did not have to be traveling all of the time.  This could be the perfect scenario.  He has really carried your water in the past and could be the perfect fit.  Just a suggestion.

Jeb,
I hope you don't misunderstand my concerns, it was obvious that Jim had a well thought out process and I respect him very much.  I am just very torn with the differeing paths of advisory groups and sincerely want the seamless education governance system to be successful.  
 
I did view Jim's recommendations as a compromise, especially the issues regarding the community colleges working with Universities to offer the degrees.  The Miami Dade teaching issue was of concern to me. But of course, I'm really on the outside of education....just trying to figure it out!

To: the Honorable Governor Jeb Bush

From: Councilman Bob Johnson
          Islamorada, Village Of Islands


Hello Governor Bush,

It is my understanding you are currently considering appointing a
temporary replacement for the recently-vacated commission seat in Monroe
County. I would like to suggest that you consider former Monroe County
Commissioner Keith Douglass, one of the most respected and capable
individuals in the Upper Keys.

Since his term as county commissioner, Douglass has become the ultimate
diplomat, while relating well to both business and residential occupants
in the Florida Keys. His people skills are outstanding and most recently
he was chosen to moderate a local political debate in the Islamorada
election. Also, Douglass is a member of the Marathon Rotary, is an
Islamorada resident and often works in Key Largo, a combination which
has provided him with a working understanding of both the social and
political dynamics of the entire Upper Keys.

A loyal Republican, Douglas is warm, friendly and outgoing. But most
importantly, Douglass is a communicator, inherently able to mediate
disputes or address difficult issues, almost always producing positive
results. Again, he is one of the most respected people in the Upper
Keys.

Thank you for considering these words and best of luck to you and yours
in these most difficult economic and political times. By the way, I
think you're doing a great job.


Councilman Bob Johnson,
Islamorada, Florida Keys

Subject: Victims rights


Dear  Governor Bush , 
I am  writing  you  because  I  was  told  you  are  the  person  to  talk  to  concerning  laws .  You  see  I  am  very  concerned  that  criminals  have  way  more  rights  then  there  victims  and  I  don't  feel  that  is  right . I  am  hoping  you could  clear  something  up  for  me .  What  I  would  like  to  know  is  if  it  is  true  that  law  enforcement  cannot  question  a  person  that may  be  involved  in  a  serious  crime  such  as  murder   if  they  say  they  have  a  attorney ?  Can  they  not question  them  in  the  presence  of  their  attorney .  The reason  I  am  asking  is  because  A  friend  of  mine  was  shot  and  killed  and  her  husband  was  the  only  one  with  her  when  this  happened  and  we  have  reason  to  beleive  he  may  have  been  involved  with  her  death .  This  happened  January  of  99 and  her death  was  ruled  a  suicide  and  the  case  was  closed until  Febuary  of  2001 .  The  case  was  reopened  because  of  too  many  Descrepencies  in  the  case  .  You  see  there  is  evidence  that  this  man  may  have  been  involved  and  he  told  so  many  lies  to  several  different  people  including  law  en forcement  and  to  this  day  has  never  been  questioned  .  He  was  not  even  questioned  the  night  it  happened  .  He  was  asked  later  to  take  a  polygraph  test  but  he  refused  and  said  his  attorney  told  him  not  to  take  one  or  answer  any  questions .  I  can't  understand  how  a  person  who  we  are  positive  has  no  lawyer  can  not  ever  be  questioned  on  any  of  his  lies  just  because  he  claims  to  have  an  attorney .  Is  this  really  the  way  the  law  works  because  if  it  is  it  should  be  changed .  There  are  too  many  people  getting  away  with  murder  because  of  this  law  and  it  is  not  right  because  anybody  can  say  they  have  an  attorney  just  to  get  out  of  being  questioned  and  if  they  are  guilty  then  they  get  away  with  it  with  no  questions  asked .  It's  like  telling  people  it's  ok  to  murder  as  long  as  you  say  you  have  an  attorney .  Please  help  me  understand  this  because  a  young  boy  has  lost  his  mother  and  the  only  chance  we  have  of  ever  finding  out  what  happened  to  his  mother  is  by  law  enforcement  questioning  her  husband  because  he  is  the  only  other  living  person  who  knows  what  happened .  This  law  gives  criminals  too  many  rights  and  their  victims  have  none .  What  can  we  do  to  change  this  law ?  If  a  person  say's  they  have  an  attorney  then  they  should  at  least  half  to  prove  they  have  one  and  still  they  should  be  able  to  be  questioned  with  their  attorney  present  .  Can  you  please  clear  this  matter  up  for  me ? 

I  know  you  are very  busy  and  I  do  Thank  you  for  your  time .

Governor: 

For over 20 years, Audubon's Center for Birds of Prey in Maitland has been a national leader on rehabilitating injured and sick Bald Eagles, and releasing them back into the wild.  In addition, our 200 Eaglewatch volunteers around the State work with agencies and landowners to conserve and protect this important species and its nesting sites.  You may have seen the "Eaglecam" live video we set up each year in conjunction with the Orlando Sentinel...real-time footage from active eagle nest.

This year, we will reach another milestone: Audubon plans to release our 250th eagle back into the wild, and we would very much like you to do the honors releasing the bird.  

Are you interested?  It's quite an experience...and you'd enjoy it!

Summaries of Florida DCF nightmares are needed now (last call) if you want me to make copies and present them Wednesday, May 15, to the Governor's Blue Ribbon Panel on Child Protection. I've received a whole stack (thanks!) and intend to do the photocopying Tuesday, May 14. As many of you know, the appeals court ruling last Wednesday, May 8, in the case of my daughter, Ashleigh Danielle Abbott, makes it so parental rights may be terminated without an evidentiary hearing -- a very dangerous precedent in an already Gestapo environment. If you have had a bad experience with Florida DCF or have any other thoughts you'd like in the hands of the panel members, please e-mail me a.s.a.p. at PaulScott@aol.com
Thanks and God bless, Paul Scott Abbott, illegally disenfranchised father of Ashleigh

Subject:	RE: WE Need Action not Panels

I'm glad to here that the panel is separate from the criminal case.  The
media has exaggerated the story again, and of course the democrats are
playing politics with it too.  I appologize for the misunderstanding.  They
already are saying the the AMW show has brought in no leads but it hasn't
had time to yet so I suggest keeping it front and center because someone
somewhere will know something that can help arrest the culprits.  

I'm glad I'm not a social worker with the DCF because its a hard job with
not enough pay and the qualifications are too low for people who are
supposed to have expertise in that field.  I feel the qualifications should
be an MSW with specialization in child welfare or child development.  I do
not feel that a BS in business or other non-related fields qualifies a
person to do that job.  when a person is qualified and has the expertise
they should also be paid better.  Having a case load of 500 or 1000 kids is
way too high and does not allow for good case management.  The majority of
the workers do a good job, based on their training and knowledge, I know
that.  However, falsification of records can not be tolerated from anyone in
any state job and I am a state employee to so it applies to me as well as
anyone else.  People are terminated from jobs for falsification of documents
or records on a regular basis.   I'm glad the legislature and you have
agreed to strengthen those laws.  I fear that something terrible has
happened to that child and until we know what the truth is, the whole system
wil continue to be under scrutiny no matter who the governor happens to be.
Unfortunately, the caregivers of the child are not exactly clean either and
they should also be subjected to investigation as well as the state
employees involved. Someone is hiding something that's for sure.  

I think a procedure should be put in place so that whenever a child is
removed from a foster home or caregivers home, a written noterized document
should be given to the caregiver so that the new location of that child and
the reason for the move is recorded so that this can not happen again.  All
parties should sign and noterize the document so that their identities can
be verified before the transfer is made.  A computer check of drivers
licenses should also be done when a kid is transferred from a home or is
removed by a case worker or other state employee. periodically, the document
format and appearance should be changed so that no one could duplicate it
and inflitrate the system.  The location of the child should also be put in
that noterized document with new addresses, phone numbers, and contact
persons for that new placement or evaluation site.  Then, it would be less
likely that a person would be able to kidnap a hchild away from a home. This
may take more time but we can't have this happen again, no matter what. All
adults in this state are obligated to care for children and I know that you
will continue to make sure this happens.

The state is not hiding Ms. Muskelly. The state atty team is working
hard on the investigation in concert with the Miami Dade police. No one
is silent. It takes time to develop a case. The task force will make
recommendations relating to the system not the criminal investigation.
Their report will be completed in several weeks. Thank you.

Dear Jeb:

	I hope all is well with you.  I have been trying to talk Raquel (Rocky)
Rodriguez from Greenberg & Traurig to apply for the Supreme Court seat that
will become vacant.  She would be perfect. An exceptional lawyer with
absolute integrity and great credentials.  She is thinking about it.  She
has a strong passion for serving that I believe will force her to apply.
The application deadline is this Friday so she has a very short time to
decide and submit the rather cumbersome application.

	Rocky would be a great Justice.  She will also be an amazing political
appointment that will provide very little room for the opposition to
critique.

	A word of encouragement from your office for her to apply would assure her
applying for the vacancy.  Please consider this.

	Abrazo.  DLP.

Jim,
 
 I read in today's St. Petersburg Times  (Pg.5-A) the Legislature rejected building a database to track people abusing prescriptions such as OxyContin, codeine and opiates. 
I support this database to protect and ensure a monitoring system for those who have addiction issues and abuse prescriptions. 
I want to let you and Gov. Bush know I am one voice of thousands whose family has been affected by substance abuse. (my daughter, Jennifer)  I wish the Legislature could sit down face to face with me, someone who has been through the war....the war of addiction, and hear me when I say we are facing challenges in our state and in our country and that traditional methods are not working to treat the ever growing problem of abusing drugs (prescription or other).  If an opiate addict cannot get heroin, they will doctor shop from one doctor to another to get the opiate based prescription they are craving.  Currently, we have no way of monitoring who these individuals are.  Therefore their addiction escalates, creating a bigger problem. 
I pray there is a seat waiting for me because I will sit between you and Gov. Bush and say what needs to be heard regarding this issue.  I believe a frank, open, honest look at this can result in positive changes to help those who need it. 
Discussion + Negotiation = Positive change for all.
 
Sincerely,

Governor, I want to make sure you know what we are doing to help you review the budget. 

I hope you received the notebook we sent to you Friday. It contains a good review of what is in the budget. If you have any questions, I am always available by phone.

This Friday, we will send you an overview of member projects and other interesting spending items. We should have a brief discussion, so that I can explain what we have done. I will go through it with Kathleen as well. Hayden will get this list so that he can review. We will then need direction on the next step. 

We are giving Daniel items that require legal review. 

We will also provide an outlook for the 2004 budget...don' worry, we have a plan :)

I understand you are having a difficult time trying to find time to review the budget . Please let me know if we can not get time before the end of the month, so we can plan to have the Governor review the budget without meeting with us. We need to be done (sign the budget) by the first week in June so that we can go through our "start-up" process, which allows agencies to spend money on July 1. Unfortunately, the start-up process takes a month.

	Tara, 

	as previously requested and as we have discussed, we are going to need time starting the week of May 20 to review budget issues with the Governor.  for the first round we are going to need 4 hours and 15 minutes as follows:

	Budget Management               15 minutes 

	Education                       1 hour 

	Health & Human Services 1 hour 

	Natural Resources & 
  General Government            45 minutes 

	Public Safety                   30 minutes 

	Transportation & Economic 
  Development                   45 minutes 


	we usually will need a couple of follow-up sessions, which we will not need that much time for each unit. 

	Please let me know if you have any questions. 

	Thanks for your help!

I am representing Voyager, a literacy curriculum for the state and local
levels.
This organization is based in Dallas and co-founded by Adm Thomas Haywood
former Chief of Naval Operations(ret). They are committed to literacy.
Following two years of research and a year of field-testing, Voyager began a
national rollout in September of 1997. In less than three years, Voyager's
research-based learning systems were operating in more than 1,000 of the
nation´s largest school districts across forty-five states, making Voyager
the largest provider of extended-time reading intervention and
adventure-based programs in America´s public schools.

To whom in the state should I contact in order to discuss our offering.

> Republican rebuked for flier in primary
>
> By DAVID FLESHLER
> Web-posted: 1:24 a.m. Sep. 2, 2000
>
> A new committee that monitors political campaigns issued its first public
> rebuke of a candidate on Friday, voting to criticize state House candidate
> Connie H. Mack for allegedly distorting his opponent's record on
education.
>    Just four days before the primary, the Fair Campaign Practices
Committee
> of Broward voted 7-3 to criticize Mack for "distortion and
misrepresentation
> of facts" concerning Lynn Spinella Pagans' position on Gov. Jeb Bush's
> school vouchers plan.
>    In a campaign flier, the Mack campaign wrote of Spinella Pagans:
>     "Losing badly in the polls, she is running a viciously negative
campaign
> against Connie Mack. Now, she's even gone so far as to attack Gov. Jeb
> Bush's A-Plus Education Plan (Palm Beach Post, 8/18/00). That's right: Ms.
> Spinella Pagans is attacking a program that will encourage children to
learn
> more, read earlier and receive the skills, training and support they need
> for the future. She's raising money from the most liberal elements of the
> Democratic Party -- people who want to defeat George W. Bush."
>    Spinella Pagans, competing in the Republican primary to represent House
> District 91, filed a complaint with the committee. She said she strongly
> supports the governor's education plan and has said so publicly many
times.
> She said she is a conservative Republican with no ties to left-wing
> Democrats.
>    The newspaper article mentioned in the flier quoted her saying that the
> education plan would be a "cold splash of water." By that, she said, she
> meant it would shake up the education system in a positive way.
>     In a statement issued after the decision, the Mack campaign took
nothing
> back. The statement said that Spinella Pagans had gotten a "sharp rebuke"
> from the committee and it said she had "clearly criticized" Bush's plan.
>     The committee tossed her complaint on ties to the Democrats, since she
> had allowed Democratic County Commissioner Lori Parrish to be host to a
> fund-raiser for her.
>    The 91st House district runs along the Intracoastal Waterway from Fort
> Lauderdale to Boca Raton.
>    The campaign practices group consists of 16 representatives of
> organizations such as the Broward Bar Association, the Broward Chamber of
> Commerce and the League of Women Voters. It is intended to investigate
> charges that candidates lied, appealed to ethnic or racial prejudice or
> spread innuendo about a candidate's personal life. The committee has no
> authority beyond the power to publicize unethical campaign practices.
>    Because the committee is venturing into local politics, there was a
fair
> amount of agonizing over whether to issue a rebuke.

I am representing Voyager, a literacy curriculum for the state and local
levels.
This organization is based in Dallas and co-founded by Adm Thomas
Haywood
former Chief of Naval Operations(ret). They are committed to literacy.
Following two years of research and a year of field-testing, Voyager
began a
national rollout in September of 1997. In less than three years,
Voyager's
research-based learning systems were operating in more than 1,000 of the
nation´s largest school districts across forty-five states, making
Voyager
the largest provider of extended-time reading intervention and
adventure-based programs in America´s public schools.

To whom in the state should I contact in order to discuss our offering.
Thank you
Bill Morgan

> Republican rebuked for flier in primary
>
> By DAVID FLESHLER
> Web-posted: 1:24 a.m. Sep. 2, 2000
>
> A new committee that monitors political campaigns issued its first
public
> rebuke of a candidate on Friday, voting to criticize state House
candidate
> Connie H. Mack for allegedly distorting his opponent's record on
education.
>    Just four days before the primary, the Fair Campaign Practices
Committee
> of Broward voted 7-3 to criticize Mack for "distortion and
misrepresentation
> of facts" concerning Lynn Spinella Pagans' position on Gov. Jeb Bush's
> school vouchers plan.
>    In a campaign flier, the Mack campaign wrote of Spinella Pagans:
>     "Losing badly in the polls, she is running a viciously negative
campaign
> against Connie Mack. Now, she's even gone so far as to attack Gov. Jeb
> Bush's A-Plus Education Plan (Palm Beach Post, 8/18/00). That's right:
Ms.
> Spinella Pagans is attacking a program that will encourage children to
learn
> more, read earlier and receive the skills, training and support they
need
> for the future. She's raising money from the most liberal elements of
the
> Democratic Party -- people who want to defeat George W. Bush."
>    Spinella Pagans, competing in the Republican primary to represent
House
> District 91, filed a complaint with the committee. She said she
strongly
> supports the governor's education plan and has said so publicly many
times.
> She said she is a conservative Republican with no ties to left-wing
> Democrats.
>    The newspaper article mentioned in the flier quoted her saying that
the
> education plan would be a "cold splash of water." By that, she said,
she
> meant it would shake up the education system in a positive way.
>     In a statement issued after the decision, the Mack campaign took
nothing
> back. The statement said that Spinella Pagans had gotten a "sharp
rebuke"
> from the committee and it said she had "clearly criticized" Bush's
plan.
>     The committee tossed her complaint on ties to the Democrats, since
she
> had allowed Democratic County Commissioner Lori Parrish to be host to
a
> fund-raiser for her.
>    The 91st House district runs along the Intracoastal Waterway from
Fort
> Lauderdale to Boca Raton.
>    The campaign practices group consists of 16 representatives of
> organizations such as the Broward Bar Association, the Broward Chamber
of
> Commerce and the League of Women Voters. It is intended to investigate
> charges that candidates lied, appealed to ethnic or racial prejudice
or
> spread innuendo about a candidate's personal life. The committee has
no
> authority beyond the power to publicize unethical campaign practices.
>    Because the committee is venturing into local politics, there was a
fair
> amount of agonizing over whether to issue a rebuke.

Dear members and friends, 
 
How many of you read this story in your local newspaper courtesy of staff writer Carl Hiaasen of the Miami Herald? 
 
Did it make you wonder why it's so difficult for consumer advocates to insist that Full Disclosure not Caveat Emptor must become the "Buy Words" in the 'Sunshine State?' 
 
Did it make you wonder if your rights as a homeowner and taxpayer are being protected at the state and federal levels of government? 
 
Did you conjure up thoughts that the 'good ole boy' network is alive and well in Florida while the tenacles have a far reaching effect?  
 
*** SEE BELOW *** 
 
The best to you and yours,

CARL HIAASEN
The high cost of changing Panhandle's name


If the St. Joe Co. has its way, Florida's historic Panhandle soon will be known as Florida's ``Great Northwest.''

....The company wants to lure thousands of baby boomers to North Florida, where it is planning no less than 20 major projects.

....St. Joe bought Arvida and launched big-time into real-estate development. With almost a million acres, including 39 miles of coast, St. Joe is Florida's largest landholder.

Its ambition is to populate the quiet Panhandle with smitten vacationers-turned-home buyers. .....If the good folks of Bay, Walton, Franklin and Gulf counties think that St. Joe has only their best interests at heart, they are sadly deluded.

...The Gulf County Commission rolled over like a fat hound...(for St. Joe),,,,,,,,, and said sure, let's move the road. Irate residents never got to vote on the matter.

But that's nothing compared to the Bay County airport boondoggle... And who would pay for St. Joe's airport? ...About 80 percent of the $200 million-plus construction cost would come from....your pocket and mine.

The Bush brothers, George W. and Jeb, love this idea. So does the Florida Legislature, which is always keen to help out struggling multibillion-dollar corporations.

...the state has committed about $10 million...President Bush....and the feds quickly kicked in $2 million to get the ball rolling.

If St. Joe pulls this off, even its critics would have to marvel. What a feat for a private company....to advance its own agenda. 

...the folks in those strapped rural counties of Florida's ''great northwest'' don't stand much of a chance in deciding their own future. That's bad enough.

What's worse is how St. Joe is relying on every other Floridian to subsidize and enrich its real-estate juggernaut with new beachfront, new highways, a new airport.

It's the ultimate corporate panhandle in a place that could not be more aptly named.

Naturally, St. Joe wants to call it something else.

Based on the evidence, the internal investigation of physical abuse was unsubstantiated.   Your case was handled appropriately and based on the foregoing disposed of properly.    FS

On May 08th, 1997, while handcuffed behind my back,  I was brutally beaten and stomped by guards employed by the Florida Dept. Of Corrections ( FDOC ) at Charlotte Corr. Inst. in Punta Gorda, Florida. The FDOC and other agencies with knowledge of the beating, and a responsibility of investigating the same,contend that nothing happen. That the guards and the FDOC followed "procedures", and that none of the investigations (by the Florida Dept. Of Law Enforcement(FDLE), Charlotte County State Attorneys, FBI, U.S. Dept. Of Justice Civil Rights Division) uncovered any wrongdoing on the part of my attackers or the FDOC, that would constitute a crime under either state or federal law. How they arrived at their questionable conclusions is something you can ask yourself after reviewing the attached documents and those that will follow.
 
Did the FDOC and the other agencies have a unspoken interest to collaborate and conceal my beating and other violence by guards that did and continues to result in the death of prisoners under FDOC control; such as John Allen Edwards who was sadistically murdered by 10 guards at the same prison nearly 60-days after I was beaten. (It should be noted that five of the guards who were federally indicted in the murder of Edwards, were the same guards whom I'd sought, but was denied protection from, by the prison and FDOC administrators in Tallahassee, prior to and after I was brutally beaten.)

Court rules to keep phone lines open
By Gina Holland
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

WASHINGTON - The Supreme Court on Monday upheld a key part of the
government's effort to give Americans choices for local telephone service.

The ruling keeps costs low for companies that want to get into a market and
could eventually lead to cheaper service for consumers.

Congress approved a plan to open up the $110 billion local telephone service
market to competition in 1996. Since then, companies ordered to make lines
available to upstart competitors have been contesting the details in court,
and many people still have no options.

Justices affirmed the way the government requires companies that were part
of the old Bell system to lease their lines. They also ruled that regulators
could require the former Bells to make more network connections available to
competitors.

The loser in the case was a conglomeration of former Bells, including
Verizon Communications, which wanted to be able to charge other telephone
companies higher fees to use their lines. Verizon contested the fee system
set up by federal regulators, arguing that it cannot recover it own
construction costs.

Consumer advocates had said if the pricing rules were overturned,
competition efforts would stall. So far, less than 10 percent of the old
Bell system is being leased by rival companies for residential service, they
said.

"This preserves a glimmer of hope for the development of local telephone
competition," said Gene Kimmelman, of the Consumers Union.

Federal Communications Commission Chairman Michael Powell said the ruling
"brings much-needed additional certainty to the legal landscape" and should
help the commission speed up changes.

Bob Bishop, Verizon spokesman, said the system has not worked and the FCC
should now consider other options.

BellSouth Inc. said in a statement that the "decision maintains an
unfortunate status quo: BellSouth must continue to provide pieces of its
network to competitors at below-cost prices. This status quo discourages
investment by both us and our competitors, resulting in poorer choices for
customers."

The decision in the complicated case has been the slowest of this term.
Justices heard arguments six months ago. Justice Stephen Breyer, joined in
part by Justice Antonin Scalia, said in a dissent that regulators were given
too much authority to order phone companies to make changes for competitors.
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who has stock in AT&T and WorldCom, did not
participate in the case.

Lapides v. Bd. of Regents of the Univ. Sys. of Georgia

Decided: 05/13/02

No. 01-298

Full Text:  <http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/01-298.html> http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/01-298.html

ELEVENTH AMENDMENT (State's Removal of Lawsuit From State Court to Federal Court Waives Eleventh Amendment Immunity)

The United States Supreme Court held unanimously (opinion by Breyer) that a state's removal of a lawsuit from state court to federal court is a form of voluntary invocation of a federal court's jurisdiction sufficient to waive the state's Eleventh Amendment immunity.

Paul Lapides, a professor in the Georgia state university system, filed suit against the Board of Regents of the University Systems of Georgia (Georgia) in a Georgia state court alleging that university officials placed allegations of sexual harassment in his personnel files. He alleged this violated Georgia and federal law. Georgia voluntarily joined in removing the case to Federal District Court. While the District Court ruled the doctrine of qualified immunity barred the federal law claim, it ruled Georgia had waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity by removing the state-law case from state to federal court. The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed, stating that state law was unclear as to whether the state's attorney general possessed the legal authority to waive the state's Eleventh Amendment immunity, thus allowing Georgia to retain the legal right to assert its immunity, even after removal. The United States Supreme Court reversed, upholding the general principle that where a state voluntarily becomes a party to a cause and submits its rights for judicial determination, it cannot escape the result of its own voluntary act by invoking Eleventh Amendment immunity. The Court recognized Georgia was brought involuntarily into the case as a defendant in the state-court proceedings, but held Georgia's voluntary removal to federal court invoked the federal court's jurisdiction.

This Friday, we will send you an overview of member projects and other

well. Hayden will get this list so that he can review. We will then need

I understand you are having a difficult time trying to find time to 
review the budget . Please let me know if we can not get time before the 
end of the month, so we can plan to have the Governor review the budget 
without meeting with us. We need to be done (sign the budget) by the 
first week in June so that we can go through our "start-up" process, 
which allows agencies to spend money on July 1. Unfortunately, the 
start-up process takes a month.

        Tara, 

        as previously requested and as we have discussed, we are going 
to need time starting the week of May 20 to review budget issues with 
the Governor.  for the first round we are going to need 4 hours and 15 
minutes as follows: 

        Budget Management               15 minutes 

        Education                       1 hour 

        Health & Human Services 1 hour 

        Natural Resources & 
  General Government            45 minutes 

        Public Safety                   30 minutes 

        Transportation & Economic 
  Development                   45 minutes 


        we usually will need a couple of follow-up sessions, which we 
will not need that much time for each unit. 

        Please let me know if you have any questions. 

        Thanks for your help!

Jacksonville lawyer tapped to manage FEMA
By Jessie-Lynne Kerr
Times-Union staff writer
Jacksonville lawyer Reynold N. Hoover, an aviation counterterrorism and
security expert, is the new chief of staff for the Federal Emergency
Management Agency in Washington, it was announced yesterday by FEMA Director
Joe Allbaugh.
Hoover, whose wife, Lucy, is an FBI agent in Jacksonville, resigned his
position with the Smith, Hulsey & Busey law firm to return to work for the
federal government. He previously served as a special agent for the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms for 17 years before joining the law firm
nearly three years ago.
While with ATF, Hoover's responsibilities included developing explosives
countermeasures and counterterrorism training programs for the aviation
community.
"Reynold brings excellent management experience to FEMA as well as valuable
knowledge of counterterrorism strategy," Allbaugh said. "His leadership will
be an important asset as FEMA implements President Bush's agenda for a
better-prepared nation."
As chief of staff, Hoover, 40, will be responsible for the daily operations
of the agency and for executing the priorities and policies set by Allbaugh.

FEMA programs include disaster response and recovery, hazard mitigation,
training, preparedness exercises, insurance and fire prevention.
Headquartered in Washington, FEMA has 10 regional offices with a permanent
staff of 2,600, a temporary staff of 4,000 and a $6.4 billion annual budget.

As an associate at the Smith, Hulsey & Busey law firm, Hoover worked in
commercial litigation, said Lanny Russell, a partner.
"He got significantly involved in our firm's representation of the Bush
presidential campaign," Russell said. Hoover was the attorney for the Duval
County Republican Party during the presidential election recount.
Long considered an explosives expert, he took a leave of absence from the
firm this year to supervise security at the Salt Lake City Olympics, Russell
added.
"He's a good guy with a lot of talent and energy," Russell said. "Reynold is
talented in his organizational skills, is detail-oriented and focused."
While working with the law firm, Russell added, Hoover did some work for a
congressional committee preparing legislation concerning the licensing of
those who work with explosives and testified as an expert witness in
explosives.
Hoover graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1983.
He served in the Army and Army National Guard for nearly 20 years and was
awarded the Bronze Star for service in Operation Desert Storm.

It being me, however, I managed to swoon in the bathroom over the weekend and break my ribs. Apparently, the job has aged me more than I realized (-;. In short, I'm in a great deal of pain, pretty much immobilized, and fairly certain that graceful is not on my list of options. 

So I'll be delivering a statement this aftenroon to be read on my behalf. I WILL laugh about this in years to come but, just for your own safety, when next we're at a public function, be careful never to ask me to dance. 

Nora Williams

State health care administrator tours Immokalee medical center 
Tuesday, May 14, 2002 
By LIZ FREEMAN, epfreeman@naplesnews.com <mailto:epfreeman@naplesnews.com> 
The secretary of the state Agency for Health Care Administration strolled
the halls of the Marion E. Fether Medical Center in Immokalee on Monday,
getting a quick immersion in how the primary-care clinic is a life link to
the farmworker community. 
"It's gorgeous," Secretary Rhonda Medows said. "It's amazing. I wish I could
model it for other places." 
 <<...OLE_Obj...>> 	 <<...OLE_Obj...>>   <<...OLE_Obj...>>  Dr. Jerry
Williamson speaks with Rhonda Medows, the secretary of the state Agency for
Health Care Administration, during a tour of the Marion E. Fether Clinic in
Immokalee on Monday. Dan Wagner <mailto:dtwagner@naplesnews.com>/Staff	
Medows, who since August has been at the helm of the agency that oversees
the bulk of the state's health-care industry, came to Southwest Florida for
the first time to meet with some health-care providers and agency staff in
field offices. 
The visit is part of a statewide tour she's making of health-care entities
that receive state Medicaid funding, to see how well the programs are
performing. She made earlier visits to health-care centers in Jacksonville,
Pensacola, Tampa/St. Petersburg and Miami. 
The Marion E. Fether clinic is run by the private, nonprofit Collier Health
Services Inc. (CHSI), and it provides a full range of basic medical care,
including dental care, to a largely indigent and culturally diverse
community. 
The clinic had 120,000 patient visits last year, of which about 25 percent
of the patients are on Medicaid. Budget figures for the Immokalee clinic
alone weren't immediately available, but CHSI's total budget last year is
$12 million, of which $3.9 million is Medicaid funding, CHSI administrator
Richard Akin said. 
Medows' tour was given by Dr. Jerry Williamson, CHSI's medical director, who
talked about how the clinic has evolved since it opened in 1993 and how
there are eight interpreters on hand to provide language translation between
the medical staff and patients, many of whom migrated to Immokalee from
Mexico, Haiti, Guatemala and elsewhere. 
"Half the problem is getting people to understand what you want them to do,"
Medows said about language barriers between patients and medical
professionals. 
Medows was asked about a new program - generically known as an
intergovernmental loan program - being developed out of this year's
legislative session that would provide more funding for primary-care
services. By offering local money, communities can tap matching state
Medicaid money and be eligible for federal money. The program will require
the pooled money to be allocated to a local hospital, which then funnels it
to a primary-care clinic that's designated to receive federal dollars. CHSI
has that designation. 
The program is being considered by the county's Health and Human Services
Committee to address the indigent-care problem, but no word has come down
from Tallahassee yet whether funding was allocated in the new state budget. 
Medows said she wasn't familiar with the program and couldn't comment.

FROM THE OFFICE OF REP. DAVE WELDON, M.D. 
For Immediate Release: May 14, 2002 
Contact: Pamela Groover at 202-225-3671 Statement by Rep. Dave Weldon, M.D. (FL-15) Subcommittee on National Security, Veterans Affairs, and International Relations 

I appreciate the Chairman for calling this hearing today, I am pleased to see Dr. Bob Roswell is his new position here before us today.  I have had the pleasure of working with you over the past few years while you served as VISN 8 Director in Florida. While Dr. Roswell presided over VISN 8 we saw the funding for VISN 8 increase by about 40%; however, we also saw the number of veterans seeking service in VISN 8 increase by 40%.  This is a critical point.  Because as we look at the impact of VERA, we must also consider the dramatic increases in utilization of the VA that we have seen in places like Florida.  While VERA has made funding a little more equitable, those of us representing growth states still see significant funding problems and believe that much more progress needs to be made.  While the Chairman and I come from very different regions of the country and come at VERA from a different perspective, I believe that we share a common goal of working toward best serving the veterans who have given of themselves to defend our liberties. Just yesterday I received the following message from one of those veterans who happens to live in Florida.  My constituent wrote: "Veterans health care at Viera [outpatient clinic] claims they can't accept any more veterans.  I am a disabled veteran from World War II.  The steel company I worked for went out of business.  I lost my hospitalization, and need protection from the high cost of medicine. I am 80 years of age and back in 1943/44 I flew 69 missions over Europe as tail gunner and I have the Purple Heart. I was also promised health care if I ever needed it." Another constituent told me he has "been enrolled with the VA clinic at Viera for well over one-year.  I am a 'category 5' nearly poverty level income... I am told they are not making any more appointments and haven't for over one year...  They do not know when the situation will change.  What good is a VA clinic if they won't make any new appointments?  My income in 2001 was $22,000 and my medical bills were over $9,000." Let me play for you the recorded message that veterans in my Congressional District in Florida get when they call the local medical VA clinic to enroll or get an appointment. (Transcript below) You have reached the Brevard VA outpatient clinic enrollment eligibility office.  We are either on the phone or assisting another veteran at this time. If you are calling about the status of your application, our clinic has reached full capacity and we cannot take any new patients. If you have submitted an application after January 1st 2002, your name will automatically be placed on our waiting list, and you will receive a letter when we can start taking new patients again.  We do not anticipate that happening this year so please do not call us to ask where you are on the list or how long it will be before we contact you by letter. If you wish to be placed on the waiting list, plea leave your name, full social security number and telephone number and we will return your call within 72 hours.  Thank you for calling and have a great day. Clearly, we do not have enough resources in Florida to meet the needs of the thousands of veterans like these, who are waiting to enroll or simply waiting for an appointment to see a provider.  I also know about this shortage first hand, as I volunteer my medical services at the Viera clinic on a monthly basis.  I see it first hand every month as I see patients. In contrast to this shortage in Florida, I was troubled when I came across the following letter from the Bronx, NY, VA Medical Center inviting all veterans to come by for a free annual exam.  The letter reads: Dear Veteran: On behalf of the [VA] may we extend our best wished to you on your Birthday. As part of our reorganization the VA Medical Centers are expanding to make our facilities more friendly and accessible to all our veterans.  At present, we have a program whereby all veterans may receive a yearly physical examination free.  Thereby offering one and all the opportunity to see for themselves, at no expense, the quality services offered by our team of expert medical clinicians.  Also, Veterans scheduling a free physical exam will also receive a free eye exam and glasses at General Vision Opticians (convenient locations). If you are interested in arranging for an appointment, please call....We will arrange for an appointment, at your convenience, as soon as possible..." Meanwhile, back in Florida, A 78-year-old veteran wrote me earlier this year stating: "I have a service-connected hearing disability and need hearing aids desperately.... However, due to the critical shortage of doctors, it will be more than one year before I will be assigned to a doctor....' In Florida the VA says we don't have enough money - give us a call next year. In New England the VA sends out a birthday letter inviting the veteran to come in for a yearly physical, hearing and eye exam.  How is this possible?  Clearly, VERA needs to be updated to better reflect the needs of veterans across the nation.  We have a good start, but he inequity is far too large.  We have a lag time in allocation of VA dollars that is about a year and a half behind.  With the type of growth rates we are seeing in Florida we cannot allow this to keep happening.  In Florida we have over FORTY-TWO THOUSAND veterans on a waiting list to see a primary care provider.  They cannot even get in the door.  The waiting list in Central Florida alone has grown from 12,000 to 16,000 in just the last two months.  We have thousands more who are on a waiting list just to get enrolled in VA care. Our veterans deserve better. I thank the chairman for holding this hearing and I look forward to his working with me to address these important matters.

Bells' rivals bypass residences to focus on businesses 
05/12/2002 

By VIKAS BAJAJ / The Dallas Morning News 

The local phone bill is proving too cheap to pick a fight over. 

Few challengers are bothering to battle Southwestern Bell for Jane Consumer.
She's already getting a sweet deal from the monopoly: She's only charged a
portion of what phone service costs. 

The rest of the tab is footed by long-distance callers and businesses, some
regulators and industry officials say. 

Six years after Congress declared the local phone bout open, many Bell
rivals are lobbing sales pitches mainly to businesses. Only 5.5 percent of
homes and small companies are served by the challengers, compared with 9
percent for all phone lines. 

"As long as you have a subsidy, you are trying to make water run uphill,"
said Dr. Alfred Kahn, an adjunct economics professor at Cornell University. 

But untangling the phone subsidy web is controversial. Southwestern Bell and
the three other Baby Bell monopolies would like to raise basic rates to
encourage competition. In return, consumers are promised lower long-distance
rates and businesses lower local phone bills. 

The Florida Legislature recently authorized an increase in basic rates, but
many other states have roundly rejected rate hikes. 

"The system is ugly, not at all effective and it does discourage
competition," said Robert C. Atkinson, director of policy research at
Columbia University's Institute for Tele-Information. "But the reality is
... legal, regulatory processes tend to move slowly." 

Subsidies are a legacy of a 1919 deal struck by AT&T's then-chairman
Theodore Vail and President Woodrow Wilson. The company won a monopoly in
exchange for regulation. 

Low local rates, about $11 in Dallas today, have helped bring phones to the
masses. Today, 95 percent of American homes have phones. 

"There is a real benefit of having the country interlinked, and so in the
early stage we subsidized getting people linked," said Dr. Kahn, who has
testified on behalf of Verizon Communications Inc., the nation's biggest
local phone company. 

Some legislators and consumer advocates, who oppose rate increases, agree
that subsidies played a key role in the past but contend that their effect
today is overstated. Rivals such as MCI and AT&T are raising a sustained
attack on the Bells on the home front, they say. 

"It is remedied now," said Texas House Rep. Steve Wolens, D-Dallas. "The
Legislature has exercised a thoughtful judgment on what basis telephone
services should be regulated and deregulated, and ... permitted deregulation
in areas that are not essential." 

Bell rivals say it's only natural that businesses would benefit from
competition before consumers because businesses use more phone and data
links. But as challengers master the game, they're warming up to consumers
as well. 

At what price? 


The issue's contentiousness and complexity is highlighted by experts'
inability to agree on just how much of the local phone bill remains
subsidized. 
SBC Communications Inc., Southwestern Bell's corporate parent, couldn't
quantify how much its local rates are subsidized. 

Economists and policy-makers answer many thorny questions when setting
rates: What does basic local service cost in relation to Caller ID or voice
mail? What's an appropriate subsidized price in rural areas where people
live farther apart? 

The interplay of different rates has been fine-tuned by regulators over
decades to achieve certain economic and political goals, said Brad Ramsey,
general counsel of National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners.


"Business rates do typically subsidize residential rates in most
jurisdictions, and urban people subsidize rural rates," he said. "There are
a lot of different mechanisms. It's not just explicit [subsidy] funds. It's
also rate differences and geographical rate averaging." 

But if costs were tabulated differently, basic residential phone service
wouldn't seem cheap, said Janee Briesemeister, a Consumers Union policy
analyst in Austin. 

For example, modern telephone switching equipment has technology built in
for features such as Caller ID, she said. But much of the machines' cost is
assigned to local phone service. 

"If you look at all services and allocate the cost fairly, local service is
not provided below cost," Ms. Briesemeister said. "You don't need a fancy
switch to make plain old telephone service." 

But some regulators say it is clear that businesses, on average, pay twice
as much as consumers for a telephone line. This has encouraged Bell
competitors to target companies, not homes, said Brett Perlman, a Texas
Public Utility Commissioner. 

"It's the Jesse James school of competition: People go where the money is,"
he said. 

How close is too far 


Subsidies are also funneled from long-distance rates to local phone service.

AT&T and others pay Southwestern Bell access charges for each minute the
local network is used for a long-distance call. The fees come in two
flavors: interstate and in-state. 

"The idea was that people who use long-distance paid more in order for local
rates to stay low," said Judy Walsh, SBC's senior vice president of state
regulatory compliance and policy. 

The interstate charge is about 1 cent a minute. In exchange for reducing the
rate in the late 1990s, the Federal Communications Commission let the Baby
Bells levy a $5 monthly fee on local phone bills. 

Southwestern Bell's in-state fee in Texas is 5.7 cents a minute. 

(The PUC wants to lower the charges, but SBC has sued to block it, saying
only the Legislature can do so.) 

High in-state charges mean Dallas residents often pay more to call Austin
than New York. 

In some other states, keeping local rates low has other peculiar
consequences. 

In New Jersey, regulators have kept local calling areas small so basic rates
can be as low as $8 a month, said Mr. Atkinson, a Garden State resident. 

"Any call of any distance here is a long-distance call," he said. 

Profit centers 


Those examples are worrisome, but they don't present the full picture, some
policy-makers and industry officials say. 
In Texas, Southwestern Bell has been able to set the rates on features such
as Caller ID and three-way calling since 1999. The company has doubled or
tripled the price on some features. 

Allowing those fees to climb has eliminated the need to raise basic prices,
Mr. Wolens said. 

"The killer profit center for them is Caller ID," he said. "It's just
enormous profit. The cost of that is next to nothing." 

Local phone companies can't afford to lose money on consumers, even with
higher business rates, said Royce Holland, chairman and chief executive of
Dallas-based Allegiance Telecom Inc. 

"In urban areas, most lines are profitable," Mr. Holland said. "When you get
access charges, Caller ID, call waiting, that really fattens [profit]
margins." 

Those fees have made it possible for competitors to break into the local
phone market, said Billy Jack Gregg, a board member at the National
Regulatory Research Institute at Ohio State University. 

For instance, MCI's new Neighborhood package includes local service, several
phone features and unlimited long-distance for $50 to $60. 

"The market itself will ferret out subsidies if they indeed exist," Mr.
Gregg said. 

But Caller ID and other features don't nullify subsidies because many people
aren't buying, said Ms. Walsh, a former Texas PUC commissioner. 

Rivals can skim away businesses and affluent consumers who buy many
features. But that leaves SBC to serve everyone else, she said. 

"Every time a customer is taken away [from us] ... their vertical features
and access charges go, too," Ms. Walsh said. "We have a bigger percentage of
customers that need a subsidy." 

SBC says rivals have another key advantage: They can lease its telephone
wires and equipment at low wholesale rates set by regulators. Some states,
including Texas, are considering further reducing those prices, on average
about $21 per line here. 

"Lowering the [wholesale] ... prices is a real danger and threat to the
whole economic structure of the industry," Ms. Walsh said. 

Adjusting rates 


The Supreme Court is reviewing a Baby Bell challenge to the method
regulators use to calculate wholesale prices. A decision is expected soon. 
But rivals say lower wholesale rates are justified because newer telephone
technologies are more efficient. 

"The [wholesale] rates in Texas are relatively low, but ... other SBC states
have set prices significantly lower," said Neal Larsen, WorldCom Inc.'s
director of public policy in Austin. "We are making money in Dallas and
Houston, not a whole lot, but it's at least profitable ... We don't need to
raise local rates to do that." 

Mr. Atkinson, the Columbia scholar and a former FCC official, proposes a
food stamps approach to telephone subsidies. People who can't pay full
freight would receive discount vouchers. The money would come from a fund
financed by all phone users. 

Current universal service funds already help rural and low-income urban
users, but the subsidy is given to local phone companies, not customers. 

"Some people's bill will go up and others will drop," Mr. Atkinson said.
"It's ridiculous to subsidize one of your oil millionaires. But by the same
token, it's absolutely necessary to subsidize rural farmers." 

SBC says regulators should let the market set local phone rates because
competitors will keep local phone companies in check. 

"If policy-makers would allow some pricing freedom, then residential prices
would be raised to the point where competition would come in and find it
valuable to serve those customers," Ms. Walsh said. 

'Do no harm' 


But it's counterproductive to raise rates to encourage competition, said Mr.
Gregg, who is also director of West Virginia Public Service Commission's
consumer advocate division. 
"It's akin to destroying the village in order to save it," he said. "We want
to raise rates to induce competition to [then] lower rates. But we already
have low rates. My maxim is to first do no harm." 

Regulators are terrified at the prospect of people giving up phone service
if basic prices rise. 

"You don't want to be in a situation where our telephone penetration is
going down," FCC Commissioner Kevin J. Martin said. 

Despite stiff opposition, some governments have taken a stab at subsidies. 

In Florida, Gov. Jeb Bush recently signed a bill that would raise local
rates by $3 to $8 in return for lower long-distance access charges. 

But a Kansas measure that would free SBC from most rate regulation by 2005
has foundered. Lawmakers there have said there isn't enough competition to
keep the company honest once it's unleashed. 

Legislators and regulators expect SBC to push for more freedom in Texas
during next year's legislative session. 

"The Legislature is going to have to take up that issue," Mr. Perlman said.
"Basic, local rates are frozen through 2005, and that issue will come up, if
not this session, then the next session."

Subject: Preliminary General Revenue Report



You will be receiving this report on a monthly basis, as requested by Don Langston.

The attached is a preliminary gauge of general revenue that is expected to be collected for the month of April based on current collection information. These data will change once the Department of Revenue completes processing the receipts for this month.

 The attached report shows that General Revenue collections for April exceeded estimate by just over $132 million, more than offsetting the March shortfall of $80 million.  The April number brings year-to-date collections to $52 million over estimate.  A closer examination reveals that, on a year-to-date basis, most of the individual revenue sources, including sales tax, are very close to the projections made in early March.  The exception is corporate income tax, which is over estimate by $85 million.  

 While the April numbers are certainly positive it is important to put them in perspective. Note that sales tax collections increased only about 2.5% over April of last year.  For Florida, this is very modest growth and is indicative that there is still some lingering weakness in the economy.  Also, even with April's results, corporate income tax year-to-date is 7% below the same period last year.  The point is, that the worst is behind us, but we have yet to achieve the kind of revenue growth associated with a full-blown economic expansion.  The prospects are very good, though.  Generally, the economy is progressing as expected.  There is solid economic evidence that a modest recovery is under way.  Since last February, when the official economic forecast was adopted, the national economic outlook has improved marginally.  It would not be surprising to see further gains relative to estimate in coming months, though it is still too early to tell if April was an aberration or a sign of things to come.

Gov. Saw Patrick's response to Jay Jones. This consortium is being 
constructed under the notion of developing hurricance mitigation activities, 
which is under the aegis of a DCA fund for such purposes. Although Tom is 
indeed the insurance commissioner I believe that this particular hurricane 
mitigation program indeed does come under the purview of Mr. Siebert and 
Shirley Collins at DCA. I believe Mr. Carter may confirm.

Subject: We Might Lose the "CSI Miami" Series

Pam/Kathleen:

CBS has decided to take the new Miami spin-off of the hit TV series,
"CSI"
BACK TO LOS ANGELES, due to financial reasons.  During a meeting last
week
with CBS, they are leaning heavily on shooting the exteriors and aerial
shots here, but doing the rest on a stage in LA.

I've worked with the local film offices in Miami, Miami Beach, the
County,
Beacon Council etc. on finding them eligible incentives, since they will
be

Building a new studio in an urban core (eligible for Urban Job Tax
Credit
Prog. & local Cmmty Block Dev. Grant)
Hiring full time employees (min. 200 - might be eligible for QTI due to
pay
rates)
Motion Picture Sales Tax Exemption

Everything that is available for me to use in terms of economic
development
incentives is on the table.  This show will produce a $40 million eco
impact
ANNUALLY.  We cannot let this one get away.  If I find out the number
that
they need to reach in order to stay in Florida, I would very much like
to
explore using some of the Closing Fund.  What do I have to do make this
happen?

I'm in Ft. Myers today and tomorrow dealing with the Denzel feature.  I
can
call you.  Will be checking email regularly.

FYI - fall TV schedules will be formally announced on Wednesday.
AARRRGGHHH!!!!

This ruling about the Univ. of Michigan law school has made national news
today.  The key points to remember are (1) this was a sharply divided 5-4
decision by the 6th Circuit today, (2) the 5th Circuit (TX, LA, MS) and the
11th Circuit (FL, GA, AL) have issued contrary opinions, (3) because the
11th Circuit governs Florida, we would have had no choice but to comply with
its decision requiring race-neutrality had One Florida not already been in
effect, (4) this is headed to the Supreme Court, so it's far from over, and
(5) isn't it far superior to achieve diversity in a way that is safe from
the vagaries and shifting tides of judicial opinions and ballot initiatives?

  FYI
A key factor in the university's victory was that the 6th Circuit found UM's
law school admissions policy agrees with a 1978 Supreme Court decision in
the Bakke case. Justic Lewis s Powell said in his opinion that a racially
diverse student body is a compelling governmental interest, justifying the
use of race, said Robert Sedler, Wayne State University law professor.

FIU's Student Government and the College Republicans, was recently informed of the support FIU was getting from the state legislature when it came to the budget.  Supposedly, FIU will be getting some kind of needed financial support that will affect all of us (students) in a positive way.  From the looks of it, we successfully lobbied to the Dade-delegation about our student-needs and FIU's budget problems during FIU Day (February 7th).  We just hope that luck is on our side and the financial support FIU is getting will also be approved, minimizing the affects of a non-funded Bright Futures summer term.  Thank you Governor Bush for taking time out of your busy schedule to reading this email and thank you for your FIU support of four years and running.

Steve,
 
Some time ago, you mentioned that the State Technology Office was having troubles after its director got into legal troubles.  I just saw a piece about the STO on the Internet, and unfortunately, it looks like things still are not on a firm footing.
 
As you know, since I co-founded and later left WebMD, I’ve been living the good life in Atlanta, but the Boy Scout in me still wants to do something to make a difference.  I wonder if I could be helpful at the STO on an interim basis, say for the next six months, to put things in order there and implement Jeb’s vision for how that operation should be run.  I think he’s on the right track in wanting to capture economies of scale, coordinate and rationalize the disparate elements of the state’s IT infrastructure and leverage the Internet to increase citizen access and efficiencies in government operations.  (As we used to say back at WebMD, “I’ve drunk the Kool Aid.”)  But he needs someone there who can make it happen.
 
During my time at WebMD, I planned and managed key strategic relationships with many of  the key players in the technology industry and raised over $1 billion in private strategic investments.  I modestly think my experiences could be very helpful in structuring an office that looks and runs like a private technology company.  
 
If Jeb had someone over there on an interim basis, he could take his time finding the right person for a permanent appointment, in a less politically charged situation.  (By the way, you may recall that I’ve also had experience handling sensitive Tallahassee situations efficiently and with “minimum wake.”)
 
If you think this is not totally crazy, let me know.  I could run down to Tallahassee some time and talk about it with whomever you think would be appropriate.
 
Michael

At the Blue Ribbon Panel yesterday it became really obvious that

The panel is great and Sara Herald's knack for cutting through the stupid

And good luck in November. There is no way they can even come close!

Governor: 

For over 20 years, Audubon's Center for Birds of Prey in Maitland has been a national leader on rehabilitating injured and sick Bald Eagles, and releasing them back into the wild.  In addition, our 200 Eaglewatch volunteers around the State work with agencies and landowners to conserve and protect this important species and its nesting sites.  You may have seen the "Eaglecam" live video we set up each year in conjunction with the Orlando Sentinel...real-time footage from active eagle nest.

This year, we will reach another milestone: Audubon plans to release our 250th eagle back into the wild, and we would very much like you to do the honors releasing the bird.  

Are you interested?  It's quite an experience...and you'd enjoy it! 

As ever,

More info from AHCA staff... 

this little boy, Collin, now has his customized wheelchair.  His parents
brought him from Jacksonville to Tallahassee and participated in a telephone
conference call with providers.  After hearing concerns re: recently
implemented Medicaid policies for prior authorization and pricing, Bob's
decision was to suspend current policy and reinstate pre-January policy.
Providers and the family seemed very grateful.

We also asked the Area Offices to compile lists of any pending requests and
move them quickly through the system.

This response will go to the writers -- 
 
Thank you for your e-mail about the Medicaid policy on paying for custom
wheelchairs. I certainly understand your concern.

I am happy to tell you that the policy that went into effect in January
has been suspended, and Medicaid has reinstated its old policies.
Representatives from Medicaid, Children's Medical Services, major
wheelchair providers and affected families participated in a conference
call to discuss the issues. People are now at work throughout the state
to collect all the pending requests for customized wheelchairs and are
working to get them processed.

If you have additional questions, you may want to get in touch with the
Medicaid office in your area.

Dear Governor Bush,

     I was copied today on a letter sent to you by Charles Ruckstuhl.
Mr. Ruckstuhl speaks to the issue of rules enacted by Medicaid in
January that mirror policies of the Medicare System.  Providers have
been refusing to take orders of highly customized wheelchairs needed for
individuals with severe physical and motor disabilities since the
Supreme Court ordered Medicaid and Medicare to pay for these chairs.
Our family member, Cynthia Norris, has been trying to replace her old
and worn chair for almost three years.  Say the word "Medicare," and you
are turned away at the door.  DME providers can not afford to sell
highly customized chairs for the prices allowed, nor would they
substitute parts that do not meet the consumers unique needs. this is
NOT an issue of greedy providers, but one of providing a service at a
fair price.   Now, Medicaid apparently has instituted similar pricing
guidelines, and effectively is preventing children as well as adults
from getting the customized chairs they need.
     Mr. Ruckstuhl outlines the problems quite clearly in his posts to
you.  I hope you will intervene on behalf of those individuals who are
unable to access the community or enjoy their lives without the
customized wheelchairs they need.  You have continued to be supportive
of persons with disabilities, and they are counting on you once again.
     Thank you in advance for anything you can do.
Priscilla L. Sherman
Family Care Council, District Nine
and Care provider for three severely disabled adults.

Subject:	UPDATE: "CSI Miami"

Crystal Sircy at Enterprise and I are supposed to talk tomorrow.  Basically,
here's what I know so far:

The gap number that Exec. Producer Sam Strangis gave me was $2.5 Million at
a minimum, based largely on the cost of relocating above-the-line creative
staff, writers and producers et al, which are full time employees. I need to
get as firm a number as possible on FTE's because I don't think that CBS has
factored this in.  These above-the-line employees, along with the other full
time below-the-line production personnel who would be hired on an ongoing
basis might make them available for QTI.  Although Kevin Berg, CBS' Sr. VP
of Production, said that cost could be even higher, to perhaps as much as $4
million. I have a stronger belief in Sam's number - he's the day-to-day
budget exec. who has been working in the trenches w/us.

CBS is unwilling to pay that much more for the series - so if we were to try
to make up the difference, it would have to be the whole number. Miami-Dade
has indicated that they could come up with about $1M - but not $2.5M plus.

Pam/Kathleen:

CBS has decided to take the new Miami spin-off of the hit TV series, "CSI"
BACK TO LOS ANGELES, due to financial reasons.  During a meeting last week
with CBS, they are leaning heavily on shooting the exteriors and aerial
shots here, but doing the rest on a stage in LA.

I've worked with the local film offices in Miami, Miami Beach, the County,
Beacon Council etc. on finding them eligible incentives, since they will be

Building a new studio in an urban core (eligible for Urban Job Tax Credit
Prog. & local Cmmty Block Dev. Grant)
Hiring full time employees (min. 200 - might be eligible for QTI due to pay
rates)
Motion Picture Sales Tax Exemption

Everything that is available for me to use in terms of economic development
incentives is on the table.  This show will produce a $40 million eco impact
ANNUALLY.  We cannot let this one get away.  If I find out the number that
they need to reach in order to stay in Florida, I would very much like to
explore using some of the Closing Fund.  What do I have to do make this
happen?

I'm in Ft. Myers today and tomorrow dealing with the Denzel feature.  I can
call you.  Will be checking email regularly.

FYI - fall TV schedules will be formally announced on Wednesday.

Dear Governor,
Congratulations on your efforts to increase spending for education in the
02-03 budget. My condolences to you and the Lt. Governor for the
consternation Senate President McKay & Speaker Feeney caused throughout the
session. Quite frankly, in my opinion it was politics at its WORST! SB-46E,
while not totally supported by the Florida Chamber and local chambers around
the state is a step in the right direction, it will pave the way for even
more needed reform in the 2003 Session. I believe Rep. Farkas and Senator
Jim King will continue their quest for reform. This issue has been plaguing
small business in our state for several years and again in my opinion SB-46E
is the most significant piece of legislation for small business that came
out of the session. There is much more to be done, not only in Florida but
nationally. I believe we can be the leaders in the country to begin much
needed reform in that industry.

I would like to suggest the Governor appoint a Blue Ribbon Panel, to travel
the state, meet with small business owners and others affect by the rising
cost of Health Insurance and Health Care. The panel should be void of any
one in the medical or insurance professions. Of course I would very much
like to be part of that panel if you were to see fit to appoint me. I have
been involved with the Florida Chamber & FACP (Florida Association of
Chamber Professional) for several  years in attempting to affect change in
the industry. The findings of this panel would be helpful in introducing
legislation in the 2003 session.

I look forward to your reply.

Sincerely,

Joe Catrambone, President/CEO

OK... the plans are set and my neighbors and I will be arriving in Tallahassee for the PSC hearings on Tuesday, May 21st at 930am.  (I don't know if you've heard, but legal doesn't recommend the commission get involved... ) Anyway- I wanted to take you up on the luncheon opportunity with the Lt. Governor... Now that the Commission has secured our time on the docket I can schedule accordingly.  I'm thinking that we should be available by 12, 1230 the latest...  Please let me know how I go about setting this up.... Maybe if Lt. Gov. Brogan is available he can join us at the hearings and get a feel for what's going on down here in Boca Raton...

Importance: High


Dear Governor,

Our friends Sharon and Tay have explored the possibilities you provided
through DBPR Director Ross Fleetwood.

While twe've received intermittent follow-up from Sharion we know your time
is valuable so we're sending you the latest communication from her about her
lack of progress and the apparent conflicts.

Incidentally, in all the communication Sharon and Tay have had with Mr.
Fleetwood and his secretary the DBPR director never indicated the DBPR had
reviewed corporate records to determine if the entities collecting fees at
Miramar and/or initiating the foreclosure proceedings were the same
corporation.

Rather, during the first telephone conversation with Sharon and Tay the
director simply indicated the DBPR might not have jurisdiction. How would he
know? I refer to the above paragraph.

Something sure is rotten in Miami and this is not the only community
experiencing multiple foreclosures.

We think the Attorney General's office should be investigating the event's
leading up to so many foreclosures of these townhouses in Miami.

If you don't believe the AG should be involved why not appoint one of your
Blue Ribbon Panels to gather all the information and make suggestions to
save these homes based on an appropriate investigation?

Regardless, unless something is done, ASAP,  apparently, Tay and others are
going to be tossed onto the street very shortly.

Since you're familiar with the language maybe you'd be willing to call Tay
in Miami and learn for yourself what's going on down there?

Sir, please read Sharon's remarks. Obviously, they are straight from the
heart.

Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to your response.

May 13, 2002

2:45 EST Monday

Re: Director of Florida Land Sales, Condominums and
Mobile Homes... Mr. Ross Fleetwood and Beatrice
Pruitt, his Secretary.

Dear Bob,

Today I received a call from Beatrice Pruitt who is the Secretary to Mr.
Ross Fleetwood.

She had a telephone number for me to give to Tay in reference to legal
representation. She stated that one of "their attorneys" had given her the
telphone number for Tay.

She and I spoke about the comment that Mr. Fleetwood had made about this
problem being one that has erupted due to the Legislature deciding not to
address the State of Florida's regulation of Townhome
Properties...again she mentioned "not being within their jurisdiction".

She said that their office had determined this is a legal problem that Tay
should seek legal help or advice for.

I stated to Ms. Pruitt that I am a "FRIEND" of Tay's and that she does not
have long distance service, that Tay recently had surgery and is a single
mom of six children which is why I made the calls to Mr. Fleetwood. I asked
her to please tell him this. She said they know I am a friend.

When Ms. Pruitt and I hung up, immediately I called Tay and we did a three
way call to the telphone number that Mr. Fleetwood's Office had given that
305-232-9680. She had indicated this is the Dade County Legal Services which
it turned out to be.

Because Tay is located in Miami it turned out to be the wrong office.
We were given another telephone number and called another office. That
telephone number is 305-576-080 Ext. O

Ms. Pruitt also said she is receiving "a package" and I think she meant from
Legal Services. She wanted an address where to forward it to. I told her I
do not know Tays specific address, only her telphone number.
I gave her my address and told her I would forward it to Tay when in
receipt.

Then Tay and I called the second number this is the results:

Because it was a three way call the volume of hearing was so reduced that we
had to end the three way call.
Tay then called that number directly herself since it was in Miami. When she
did they took her name and telephone number and told her they would contact
her in three days. And that was the end of it!

Here is another most likely problem with contacting the Dade County Legal
Services Dept. When Tay contacted a Department by the same name some time
previously, she was told that she could not be
represented by them because there is a confict of interest. The Universal
Truth Center (the church that Dade county was supposively planning to donate
a large number of foreclosures after they occur to) has an office of Dade
County within it!!!!!!!!!!!

Legal Services already represents THE UNIVERSAL TRUTH CENTER, according to
Tay...therefore that is where the conflict of interest arises. Tay believes
these are probally the same people.

So here we are on this bright and sunny day in beautiful Florida..Tay is
scheduled to go to court again on June 17...this situation has not been
improved one ounce for Tay nor the people of Timerlake (Miramar
Gardens)...time is being eaten away and no resolution...

I wanted to update you of the latest...NON ACTION by Mr. Fleetwood's Office.

Is it possible to email the Governor again and ask for him to appoint a
State Attorney to investigate this matter? Or to ask him for advice? Surely
he has someone that "WILL" do the job.

According to Tay, President Bush is planning a trip to South Florida/Miami
soon to rally support for his brother from the Hispanic
Community...and...they want this issue addressed and something done about it
before that date...if not they plan to address it...when he is present...I
am not sure how pleasantly he shall be greeted...????????

Certainly if specific actions are taken prior to that date...chances are it
would be a more pleasant reception?????visit..  :) They are planning MAJOR
PRESS COVERAGE....

The Governor has the power to combat corruption in Miami that is designed to
steal away the homes of 378 different families. What is he afraid of? I mean
as in "JEB PICK UP THE TELEPHONE AND MAKE THE RIGHT CALL...Get these people
some help..Four years in court
is ridiculous and CORRUPTION is STILL RAMPANT IN MIAMI...because no one has
been willing to use their political powers to stop the corruption.

Would the telephone call that must be made be so hard? Isn't this his
job?????Wouldn't this immensely cause support to rise for him within the
Hispanic Populations? And from others who believe in Justice? And stamping
out corruption???

Corruption in Miami vs. Jeb and the winner is Corruption???? He seriously
needs to confront this problem...
 Sincerely,
 Sharon

Attachments:	Gov recommend list 1.xls; 3rd level no with money.xls; reviewers 2003.doc; McFadden, Liza.vcf

 <<Gov recommend list 1.xls>> Governor, our Family Literacy review team has
met and recommended the following programs be funded for our second year of
statewide funding.   There were initially about 100 applicants which our
office and the Florida Literacy Coalition reviewed and screened.  Of these
approximately 30 were forwarded to the review team which selected the 15
attached for funding.  They represent a good geographical mix from around
the state and include community-based organizations, schools, a library and
a university partnership.

You may note that these projects total about $715,000.  Although this is
about $235,000 less than was funded last year, the team as a whole felt that
it was more important to fund quality programs that they felt had a good
chance for a strong start-up and continuation after one year of funding.
They took the research results from this year's first statewide start-up
very seriously (what works) and felt that it was better to fund programs
that would serve as models for DOE and other education funders than to fund
programs that would only last one year and have no long term results for the
families in these areas of great need.

Below please find the remainder of the top 30 or so that were not
recommended for funding, but with their scores and comments on why the
decision to not fund was made.   A list of the reviewers (not including me
or Lesa Kramer from FLC, but we did read all 100!) is attached.

Please let me know if you are in agreement with recommendations or have
recommended considerations of any kind.  When decisions are final, we will
invite the grantees to a June 18th event at the mansion to announce the
winners.  We will also use this event to update the state on the status of
the other parent pieces announced in Naples (I am a Reader kit).

Dear Gov; Listened intently to you talks in the Orlando 
area, to bring back to our assembly.
We're having  some concerns. 1. every election year it's 
education that needs financial help. That may not be 
true, if every family is paying their taxes we should 
have enough to get the job done . To much is being spent 
on perks and for admin facilities. 2. Your apparent 
direction to encourage additional tax increases, even 
1/2 % may cost you dearly. We want leadership to show us 
they can conserve money and live within their means. I 
think you are encouraging the states officials to just 
SPEND,and TAX. We know the states employees are a big 
part of your voters, and this subject is being aired 
more & more. 
Raising taxes will force many beyond their means, but 
not out of reach of their votes.

LAWRENCE, KS. Minnesota has done it again. For a record sixth year in a
row, the North Star State is the nation's Most Livable State. Morgan
Quitno
Press, a Lawrence, Kansas-based publishing and research company today
announced the findings of its 12th annual award. Also making a repeat
appearance in the award spotlight ? but at the opposite end of the scale
?
is Mississippi, which ranks #50 for the fourth consecutive year.


"Our award is nothing if not consistent," said Scott Morgan, President
of
Morgan Quitno Press. "But Minnesota seems to have what it takes to keep
the
other 49 states at bay. The state performs consistently well in many
areas.
Minnesota has a low teen birth rate, a high homeownership rate, a very
good
high school graduation rate and high spending for the arts. The only
category that Minnesota ranks poorly in is average daily mean
temperature."


For the last twelve years, Morgan Quitno Press has issued its Livable
State
Award. Based on 43 factors selected from updated editions of its annual
reference book, State Rankings, the Most Livable State Award recognizes
a
state for its high quality of life. The 2002 edition of State Rankings,
which compares states in more than 550 categories, was published in
April.


"We issue the award every year because it tells an interesting story
about
life and government in the 50 United States," said Morgan. Our award is
not
a measurement of which state is most fun or the best place for everyone
to
live. It is based on statistical indicators that reflect the kind of
lifestyle that most Americans agree is positive ? affordable housing,
safe
streets, good employment opportunities, a strong education system and a
healthy state economy."


Rounding out the top five spots with Minnesota are (in descending order)
Iowa, New Hampshire, Virginia and Massachusetts. Bringing up the
opposite
end of the scale with Mississippi are Louisiana in 49th, Alabama in
48th,
Arkansas in 47th and New Mexico in 46th place.


The Most Livable State Award is one of four designations announced
annually
by Morgan Quitno Press in conjunction with the publication of its annual
reference books. These other annual announcements name the nation's
Safest
City and Metro Area, the Healthiest State and the Most Dangerous State.


Additional information about 2002's Most Livable State Award is
available
through the Morgan Quitno website at www.statestats.com. For further
inquiries, please contact Morgan Quitno Press at (785) 841-3534.

Tom,

I understand that DOT and its contracted maintenance team at Association
for
Retarded Citizens (ARC) is responsible for upkeep of the Welcome Centers.
Please, I need for you to get your responsible District people to resolve
this issue pronto.

I have talked with the visitors services arm at VISIT FLORIDA and they
confirm that this Center is particularly dilapidated and ugly due to the
building age (22 years) and construct (rail ties).  I do realize that
painting is probably not a realistic option in that the building is slated
to be rebuilt in FY 2003 (to be completed 2005); however, a thorough
cleaning seems to be overdue.  I am sure all would agree, older run-down
construct is distinctly different than dirty, grimey bathrooms and grounds.


Can you please follow-up with your team and let me know what is being done
to resolve this complaint?  Please save our tourists from the war on grime.

Thanks Tom

Dear Mr. Coffay: 

Thank you for your e-mail to Governor Bush about Medicaid policy on paying for wheelchairs.  The Governor has asked that I respond on his behalf. I certainly understand your concern.

I am happy to tell you that the policy that went into effect in January has been suspended, and Medicaid has reinstated its old policies.  Representatives from Medicaid, Children's Medical Services, major wheelchair providers and affected families participated in a conference call to discuss the issues. People are now at work throughout the state to collect all the pending requests for customized wheelchairs and are working to get them processed.

If you have additional questions, you may want to get in touch with the Medicaid office in your area.

HBCU's, but to education.

I'll call you to discuss.

My problem with this is that there is an assumption, I think, on their
part that I will be reelected. I doubt that they would want me to be the
chair if I don't get reelected. I am happy to help as I have done in the
past with the UNCF. It is a great organization helping important
institutions. Wendy, we should discuss. Call me.

Governor:

Leslie and I met with James Tyson (UNCF) and Edward Jasper
(Bethune-Cookman
College) today to discuss you severing as Honorary State Chairman for
UNCF.

Mr. Tyson and Mr. Jasper indicated serving as chairman would require:

-	4-5 lunches over the next year (dependent on your schedule) in
Tallahassee, Orlando, Miami, Jacksonville and Tampa. They would like to
have
the first lunch (some time this year) serve as a luncheon/kick-off
event.
UNCF would work with the local Chambers of Commerce (in each city) to
attract 200-500 persons at each luncheon. 
-	The possible use of your name on printed material.
-	A taped message for the annual evening of stars (would not run
before December). The message would allow you to highlight your
commitment
to education as a UNCF partner.

Mr. Tyson was excited about UNCF becoming a partner with the Governor's
Black History Month Celebration and would like to announce (at the
inaugural
luncheon) the partnership and a 4 year-scholarship commitment.

UNCF understands you have a demanding schedule and they are willing to
work
around your schedule to accommodate dates/locations.

All of the HBCU presidents are excited about the possibility of you
becoming
the state's honorary chairman. 

Leslie and I would work closely with UNCF to maximize your time. Please
let
us know how to proceed.

Judge Dismisses Medicaid Lawsuit
Source: Associated Press 

By KELLY WIESE Associated Press Writer LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) _ A federal
judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by hospital associations trying to stop
the government from killing a Medicaid provision that allowed some states to
draw extra federal funds through an accounting gimmick.

AHA, NAPH decry judge's UPL ruling; response brewing in Congress 
The heads of AHA and the National Association of Public Hospitals and Health
Systems today expressed disappointment and dismay at a federal judge's
decision against blocking a Department of Health and Human Services
regulation eliminating the Medicaid 150% upper payment limit for public
hospitals. Meanwhile, Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-MN, and Rep. Eliot Engel, D-NY,
were poised late today to introduce a "resolution of disapproval" about the
rule in their respective houses. Passage of the resolution -- which requires
both houses' approval and the president's signature -- would block the rule
from taking effect. The effort on Capitol Hill follows a ruling late Monday
by U.S. District Judge Thomas Eisele of the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of Arkansas. Eisele granted HHS' motion for summary
judgment in a suit filed by AHA, NAPH and several other national and state
hospital associations and individual hospitals challenging the rule. AHA
calculates that an earlier delay in the rule brought about by the suit saved
affected hospitals almost $300 million in cuts.

Greetings; 
This is to inform you of a company violating about every law known to man.

20.) Lying about agreements with Triumph Sports Drink 
(Stonepoint never had a contract with JRSE.   I talked with stonepoints president)

22.) Violation of FDA rules by promoting the sales of resonators in the US 
(Complete violation of CFR 21  under IDE abbreivated code)

I asked Dr. B to send you her bio through this email address.  She also has a resume that she has forwarded to Governor Bush with her application for the South Broward Hospital District.  If you would like to see that, please let me know or request it from Judy when she emails you.
 
Judy serves on our development committee.  She has been a 33 year veteran of Barry University, Dean of the Nursing School.  She is highly regarded by her faculty, the community where she has established nurse services in 6 local schools with children in need, and on various boards both for professional organizations and community service.  She lives in Pembroke Pines and that is where the seat will be available this summer.  She is truly service oriented and would bring a wonderful dimension of compassion, education and knowledge of health care needs to the commissioner's role.  I think we all have had difficulty with hospital responses to need; I think Judy knows how much more difficult it is for the deaf or disabled to achieve attention.
 
Thank you for recommending her to the Governor.  I believe we will benefit from her contribution if selected.  Thank you, Sr. Margaret

Regarding: Request for Recommendation
 
Ms. Aponte:
 
Sister Margaret Johnson has suggested that I contact you for a recommendation to Govenor Jeb Bush for me to become a member of the Board of Commissioners of the South Broward Hospital District.  The position requires its members to be active in community service and familiar with health care in South Florida.  For a number of years I have been active in our community serving as a volunteer and board member for various organizations as you can see on the attached CV and biography.  I have spent much time at the Schott Center, as a nurse with the group home staff, in the gardens, and in chapel events with Sr. Margaret.  I have taken sign language classes and am beginning to be able to communicate with the staff and members at Schott.  I am also a nurse, nurse educator, and nurse administrator.  In these days of nursing shortages and our troubled health care system it is important that a nurse be represented on health care boards.  You may even have encountered difficulties with the health care system with your family.  In this position I could represent the needs of the deaf, and physically, emotionally, and developmentally disabled.
 
Thank you for considering this request.  If you need further clarification you can contact Sister Margaret at mjohnson@schottcommunities.org.  I'm sure she can answer your questions should you have any.

Subject:	Mia- Marketing office in Spain-Paramedia

Hi JEB,

Not sure you had a chance to read the articles about
Paramedia ( Billy Freixas) in the Miami Herald,  Sunday and today...
"Marketing Co. inflated MIA bills" by Joe Mozino & "High Flying Firm a drag
for MIA" by Robert Steinback.

Sure brings back a lot of mixed feelings about the Beacon Council's Madrid
office and my selection to run said office in '91/'92, in it's original
format.

If you recall, Billy Freixas was one of the 4 or 5 finalist, yet not
selected by the independent Search committee back in 1991..., even Rick
Elder voted against him..later had to resigned as Airport Director if you
recall...over disagreements with then County Manager, Joaquin Avino..
who's wife was related to Freixas..

It took Freixas/ his Dad, Miami lobbyist, Comm. Natacha Seijas (Millan),
Joaquin Avino, and others in Miami-Dade Gov't - 2 years after the Beacon
withdrew from the joint project with the airport, to re open the
bid-selection and hire The Freixas company, "Paramedia" as a consultant,  to
manage the marketing office in Spain.
It's interesting how history/details are forgotten, missed, or whatever..

Maybe it was best after all that The Beacon pulled out of the joint project
with the Airport in operating a marketing office in Madrid;
 have me travelling to EU promoting reverse investment every 90 days, though
Comm. Millan ( Seijas) sure found a way to discredit me/ my efforts with
Anderson, Nero ( in 1996-7),  resulting in the elimination of my position
and therefore the Regional business development concept/desks that the
Beacon Council fought so hard to establish.. ( big mistake).

And all because Natacha was fighting for control over the Frauhouffer
teaching Factory project with Mayor Martinez of Hialeah who got the
Coulter's to donate a building for its' establishment.. and he got the
glory..VS her..

But as they say, what goes around comes around..a full investigation is now
going on by the State Attorney's office.. If I can help with facts/history,
let me know..
When is all this corruption to end..

Miami-Dade, & Florida deserve better..
Professional, clean employees deserve better...When are we going to start
recognizing & encouraging the difference in behavior.

The concept of overseas offices managed well are not all a bad thing..
Hope this doesn't hamper the good work of the State's overseas offices..
It might..

By the way who will run Enterprise Fl. after Anderson leaves in June??
Economic development is still a passion of mine...and deserves everyone's
support...though I still feel it's better handled either totally public (
State division) or totally private.. the partnership concept gets
confused..muddy..
& opportunities arise for finger pointing, & diluted efforts.. mucha
politica..

Hope this is something you'll think about, as you prepare your campaign..
and get re elected.. Saludos, M

Dear Governor Bush: I don't think you need to do much research to decide whether to veto the Everglades Bill. 

You should veto it. 

Remember, in politics, perception is reality. And the perception here is that you and your administration is beholden to the special interests and development interests that have an improper influence over elected officials. 

Don't let your critics have more ammunition. The Governor's office is not for sale and is not there to serve the development industry, most of which are your campaign contributors and former business partners. Right? 

VETO the bill and show Jim King that he cannot fashion laws to benefit his campaign contributors and that the legislature cannot be used to destroy citizen's rights or Florida's environment. 

Sincerely,

Bush torn over Everglades bill 

Should he sign or veto the crucial funding measure - which also restricts 
challenges to development projects on environmental grounds? 

By JULIE HAUSERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
© St. Petersburg Times 
published May 15, 2002 

http://www.sptimes.com/2002/05/15/State/Bush_torn_over_Evergl.shtml 


TALLAHASSEE -- On the one hand, Gov. Jeb Bush wants to sign a bill this week 
that would pay for a billion-dollar public works project in the Everglades. 

On the other, he's hearing from thousands of environmentalists, including a 
new Florida group called Republicans for Environmental Protection, who want 
him to veto it. They say it is tainted by an amendment that favors 
developers and limits an ordinary citizen's right to challenge damaging 
projects all over the state. 

Bush has until Thursday to decide whether to veto the bill or sign it into 
law. 

"But for this, I could tell you automatically that I would sign the bill 
into law," Bush said last week. 

With e-mails pouring into his office urging a veto, Bush asked his staff for 
a list of development permits challenged under current law. 

"There's a lot of varying opinions on what this impact is," Bush said. 

Environmentalists aren't the only ones opposing the change in so-called 
citizen standing. Attorney General Bob Butterworth opposes the bill, and so 
do six of the seven candidates running for attorney general. Only Republican 
candidate Tom Warner supports the bill because he says the Everglades 
portion is too important. 

At issue is the 1971 Environmental Protection Act. Lawmakers gave ordinary 
citizens the right to challenge developers and state agencies. The theory is 
that all citizens can file a challenge, even if the project is miles away, 
because everyone has a stake in protecting Florida's environment. 

The measure sitting on Bush's desk would change that. A provision added by 
incoming Senate President Jim King, R-Jacksonville, would allow only people 
who can prove they are personally affected by a project to file a challenge. 
So, for example, a concerned citizen in Tampa who wants to stop a project in 
the Everglades wouldn't have the legal standing to challenge it. 

"It generally just improves the business climate by eliminating an 
artificial means of harassment and delay," said Frank Matthews, a 
development attorney and Tallahassee lobbyist who supports the change. "It 
addresses the gadfly, the individual who has no interest in a permit, from 
being able to sue anybody in the state to be an obstructionist." 

Environmentalists say frivolous suits are a myth. They say it takes money 
and nerve to challenge development, especially in small counties where one 
industry dominates. 

"We know that people who challenge developments take a big risk," said John 
Whitescarver of Hobe Sound, president of the Florida chapter of Republicans 
for the Environment. 

The bill also affects environmental and homeowner groups all over Florida. 
It says in order to file a challenge, a group must have at least 25 members 
in the affected area, and it has to have been a Florida corporation for a 
year. 

That worries people like Bobby C. Billie, an American Indian who is not part 
of the government-recognized Seminole Tribe of Florida. Billie, who lives in 
South Florida, is spiritual leader of an offshoot group, the Independent 
Seminole Nation, which eschews life on organized Indian reservations. 

Billie has made it his life's work to protect Indian burial grounds all over 
the state. 

Under the bill, Billie says he would have no legal standing to challenge 
development outside his home county. And he certainly doesn't have 25 
members in every county to file a challenge as an organized group. 

Three years ago, Billie objected to a development near ancient burial 
grounds along Marshall Creek in Jacksonville. The developer was a 
constituent of King's. King says someone in South Florida shouldn't be able 
to challenge a development in Jacksonville. So King tacked the 
legal-standing language onto the Everglades bill. 

Under the bill, ordinary homeowners associations also could face a tough 
legal fight. To challenge a project, a group must be incorporated 
specifically to protect "the environment, fish and wildlife resources, and 
the protection of air and water quality." Homeowner groups don't qualify. 
And most groups come together to fight a specific project, so they likely 
would not meet the requirement that the group be in place a year ahead of 
time. 

"Most of the big environmental cases in Florida could not have been brought" 
under the bill's new definitions of legal standing, said David Guest, an 
attorney for Earthjustice, a nonprofit environmental law firm. 

One case he cites: In the late 1990s, a new group organized as the 
Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida to oppose a phosphate mine 
in De Soto County because it would harm the region's groundwater. The group 
wouldn't have had standing under the bill because it didn't have 25 members 
and wasn't incorporated when it filed the legal challenge. 

"We won the case," Guest said. "We caught them red-handed on their 
misstatements of what the impacts were. The environmental impacts were much 
worse. The dramatic impacts from that mine would be taking place right now."

I wish you and the staffs working on the Rilya case the best.  Very tragic in so many ways.  I would like to believe the child will be found alive and well, however if that is not reality I hope we can bring any responsible parties to justice.  You have a tough job and there are no perfect solutions, but I am confident you will develop the best possible.
 
On a happier note--I think you are aware of how great our technology students did this year from Palm Bay High.  I have had the opportunity to see lots of schools and teachers across Florida in that program--and Mr.. Burlew does the finest job I have ever seen with the technology student association.  I am really proud of him and his students and hope they can make make Florida shine at the national competitions.  Every high school in Florida and in America need to have a tech ed program and activities for students like that--just my opinion!  What a fantastic way to bring math, science and technology together and make it relevant!  I am a bit biased I admit, but I also have my daughter enrolled in his class now and she will do TSA next year with him.  So I also speak as a parent!

Message from the Governor

This week I continued to focus on the Rilya Wilson case:  finding out what happened and taking measures to ensure it does not happen again.  The children under the supervision of the state often come to us with harrowing life experiences - truly these children are among the most vulnerable in our society - and we must show compassion as we care for them.

But while government cannot make up for all of society's ills, or completely make up for a lack of parental love and support, we can and must do the best job we can.  I remain proud of our record on child welfare, which has included a doubling of funding for child welfare services over the past four years, more child abuse investigations, and innovative programs such as community-based care to address endemic social problems in new ways.

 

Nevertheless, the Rilya Wilson case tragically illustrates that we still have a long way to go.  That's why this week I appointed a Blue Ribbon Panel on Child Protection to determine what went wrong and what we can do to prevent any more such cases.  Their report is due to me on an accelerated schedule so we can take needed action quickly.  I have also ordered all district administrators from the Department of Children and Families to confirm that every child in state custody is safe and where they are supposed to be.

 

I also applaud two measures the Legislature has taken this week to improve the system.  First, those who falsify child welfare records will now face stiff criminal penalties.  Second, the House and the Senate have come to agreement on the state's guardian ad-litem program, providing a $7.5 million increase in funding this year.  Caring, committed volunteers make up this program, which serves as a safeguard for children who have been placed in the state's care and are awaiting placement in a permanent home.  

 

Also this week I attended the Fallen Officers Memorial Service in Tallahassee to honor those Florida law enforcement officers who gave their lives in the line of duty.  I hosted an Educators' Summit in Tampa that focused on our "Just Read, Florida!" initiative.  I also highlighted the early success of our "Florida:  A Healthy State" program at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, congratulated Homestead Senior High on being one of three schools nationwide given an Inspiration Award from the College Board, and thanked the Council of 100 in Naples for their continued leadership in fostering economic opportunity across our state.

 

Please continue to pray for the return of Rilya Wilson to safety, and for all children in our state whose unfortunate home environments necessitate government intervention and supervision.

 

Sincerely, Jeb Bush

 

 

JUST READ, FLORIDA!

 

Governor Jeb Bush spoke to teachers Monday about the Just Read, Florida! initiative at the Second Annual Governor's Educators' Leadership Summit.  The Just Read, Florida! initiative is an effort to create a comprehensive and coordinated reading strategy aimed at helping every student become a successful and independent reader.  The two-day summit brought together K-20 educators recognized for their outstanding contributions in reading to Florida's students, schools and communities.  The summit featured sessions conducted by some of Florida's own reading experts: Dr. Joe Torgesen, Director, Florida Center for Reading Research, Florida State University; Dr. Maria Elena Arguellas, School of Education Research, University of Miami; Dr. Holly Lane, Department of Special Education, University of Florida; and Dr. Mary Little, Project CENTRAL, University of Central Florida.  Topics ranged from the latest research on reading, the use of data to inform instruction, and success stories from Florida elementary, middle and high schools.  Also at the Education Summit, Citigroup announced a gift of $125,000 as the founding partner of the Consortium of Education's Teachers are Heroes program.  Teachers are Heroes will provide mini-grants to teachers to work with mentor teachers on a broad array of curriculum projects.

ON THE ROAD WITH FLORIDA'S FIRST LADY


 

First Lady Columba Bush and Florida's Office of Drug Control Director Jim McDonough hosted the launch of a new education teen television show "Choices" at Palm Beach Garden High School Thursday.  The "Choices" program will follow the lives of a teen-age cast as they struggle through the turbulence and frustration of the teen-age years.  The interactive series is being distributed to middle and senior high schools throughout Florida.  The First Lady and Director McDonough were joined by the cast of "Choices," parents, students, faculty and staff of Palm Beach Garden High, Charles Stiles, partnership chairman and Nat Harrington of the Palm Beach County School District.  On Friday, First Lady and  Director Jim McDonough visited the Key West Housing Authority's, Campus South, Drug Free Kids and Safeport drug prevention programs in Key West.  The Key West Housing Authority was first established in 1938.  In addition to managing public housing units and Section 8 housing, the Key West Housing Authority has developed and currently manages special programs that benefit the housing residents.  Campus South, Drug Free Kids and Safeport represent just three prevention, education and treatment program initiatives located in public housing communities.  Protecting youth from substance abuse is one of the four major goals identified in Governor Jeb Bush's Drug Control strategy.  The early indications are that the administration's efforts at prevention are working.  Since becoming Florida's First Lady, Mrs. Bush has traveled with Director McDonough throughout the state speaking with youth about the dangers of substance abuse.  Two of her top priorities are to reduce substance abuse among Florida's youth and to get them involved in the arts.  In collaboration with Arts for a Complete Education / Florida Alliance for Arts Education (ACE/FAAE), the First Lady visits at least two school art programs a month.  She also awards 24 art scholarships for $1,000 each to students in visual arts, music, dance and theatre a year.  For more information on the First Lady, please visit www.myflorida.com <http://www.myflorida.com/> .

GOVERNOR'S POINTS OF LIGHT AWARD


 

Over the last 11 years Albert and Barbara Davis have prepared and shipped approximately 17,000 loaves of banana bread to service members in the Middle East.  "We heard that due to the heat, bananas were not readily available to service members," said Mrs. Davis.  "We thought that this bread, containing as many bananas and nuts as possible and very few preservatives, would be a good substitute to provide potassium and vitamins to our troops."  Mr. and Mrs. Davis use their own funds to purchase the ingredients and bake each loaf in their home, at the rate of seven loaves per hour.  Albert Davis served over 26 years in the Navy and fought in three wars.  "I feel this is a small payback for the many times my life was saved in combat," said Mr. Davis.  "I want the troops to feel that someone back home cares and is thinking about them."  "All aspects are considered in preparing the banana bread," said friend Tonya Mendoza.  "From the selection of ingredients to storage and delivery, Mr. and Mrs. Davis provide service members who are away from home with a welcome addition to their standard military meals."  Albert and Barbara Davis are this week's Points of Light Award winners.  Congratulations!

Dear Gov Jeb: 

Yes, I understand DCF can't fire someone who has already resigned, but, and I realize it would be a judgment call, I tend to lean to firing someone for a record of poor job performance rather than allowing that someone the option to resign.  Nevertheless, I'm not privy to this situation, and perhaps the "eye on the ball" decision was to get someone out of a job as quickly and inexpensively as possible.   

Anyway, one other thought I have to break the cycle of these poor children continually being churned through the welfare system by these derelict, self-absorbed, non-caring parents is similar to the "3-strike" law.  After birthing 2 children who become wards of the State, at the time of the 3rd child born by one of these "mothers", her tubes should be tied right there on the spot so that no more future children will see such suffering.  I'd like the fornicating "father" to have a vasectomy.  But, realistically I have not figured a way in  to know who the "father" is or how to find him if he did not voluntarily identify himself, which he probably would not do.  It may seem extreme to some, but something needs to happen to break these vicious downward cycles of generational welfare children.  And I really do think the neglect and abuse the children endure is criminal and when at least 2 children have been dumped into welfare, the "parents" don't deserve any more chances after the 3rd baby.  Anyway.....

Governor,
 
After your call this morning Melissa and I spoke with Crystal Williams, of the INS Office of Policy and Planning.  This is the office responsible for the regulation.  We have worked with her in the past on this particular issue.
 
Crystal reported that the INS received over 7,000 letters and comments on the regulations.  Many letters were products of letter writing campaigns but there are several hundred “serious” letters and comments.  She does not see “fast action” on the publication of the final regulations.  It will take INS some time to get through the comments.
 
The State Department also wrote comments for the INS----we have called for a copy.
 
We are checking with the Congressional Committees to see what they might have in mind and are following up with our prior Hill contacts and other state offices.  Given your comments about the effects on the international business economy and real estate market and that both the FL Bankers and FL International Bankers have contacted this office about the issue----I’m wondering whether we should ask the Bankers or maybe OTTED to develop an economic study on the effects of the regulation?----Pam?
 
We will follow-up with an action plan shortly.  Nina.

Folks,
 
Today a client of mine is meeting with Gov. Bush.  Not a parent.  The student.  She is a gifted LD student who has anxiety disorder and panic attacks, she is obsessive-compulsive, and although she is an A-B student and has been in magnet schools since 3rd grade, she can't pass the FCAT because she can't have the accommodations she needs to pass--and under current rules she won't receive a diploma.  She is a student capable of going through college and beyond, capable of becoming anything she wants to be.
 
I've been helping her family for nearly a year now trying to find ways to do what is appropriate in this case, and when we finally found an alternative, it is so obscure that nobody really knows how it should be done.  So I asked the student to write to Gov. Bush, knowing she could, knowing that sometimes students can make a case their parents can't.  We thought it would be just an exchange of letters between the student and, ultimately, an aide appointed to handle the case.  No, it didn't work that way.  Bush is in a town meeting at her school today and wil spend 20 minutes with her himself!  This is a beautiful, articulate and eloquent student who will leave him simply astonished that she will not be able to get a diploma in Florida.
 
If things go well, this student is going to ask Bush if he can't use his executive powers to request a "stay of execution" and an emergency creation of an alternative until the bill that will free us to use all IEP and 504 accommodations on standardized testing is passed.  
 
Please use all your influence with God to ask that Bush and this student can become the focal point for a change Florida's disabled students need very much.  Virtual flowers, hugs, kisses to both feet, etc., in advance for your help!

Subject: Nursing Home reforms

Dear Governor Bush: 

We share a common interest in nursing home reform and I appreciate that
the issues concerning nursing homes are an important part of your
agenda.  My name is Cynthia Maddock.  I am an RN and have previously
worked in private industry performing nursing home inspections
throughout Florida in an effort to ready nursing homes and their staff
for State Survey.  I believe these positions in private industry (though
slowly becoming eliminated due to cost-cutting efforts) and that of the
State Survey Teams play an integral part in the effort to provide
quality care to our elderly. 

I would like to be involved in efforts to monitor and reform our State's
nursing homes.  Though recently I submitted an employment application to
the Region 7 AHCA office in regard to an opening on their Survey Team, I
wanted to inquire as to whether there are plans, that I am not aware of,
to involve other State agencies that I may contact, or will new
departments be created in this reform effort?  Governor Bush, any
assistance that you can provide would be greatly appreciated. 

Our State has numerous challenges, including nursing home reform.  As a
Florida citizen, I support your efforts in addressing many of these
issues. 

Respectfully, 

Cynthia G. Maddock, RN

We have a retired Greyhound in our family and we had one that just passed away. These are great dogs that live to run. 

Pearl is the name of our dog and is a member of the family. This bill will insure that other retired Greyhounds are placed with a family and become a valuable member of that family.

Please sign this bill and allow the hard work of the Greyhound Adoption programs to go on.

Governor, Ms. Smith's issue is still unresolved, primarily b/c the state
funding that was to be matched with the federal dollars to begin the
construction was eliminated from the budget during the budget reductions
last fall.  In this most recent session, the Legislature did not restore
this reduction.  So even though this is a good match ratio with the feds,
the funding was still not allocated by the state to allow construction to
proceed.

Dear Governor:

I was attending the "heroes luncheon" this afternoon in Tampa when you
addressed the room.  It was a moving tribute to all of the men and women
who
serve our Country.  You would have been very proud of our State as Gen.
Franks represented our local community and our Country with such
eloquence.
Your comments were heard by 5,000 who attended today's event.

I was also reminded to follow up with you on the issues we have
discussed
previously.

I have had the opportunity to speak with you in person about the issue
related to the construction industry.  Specifically, our company, The
A.D.
Morgan Corporation, with offices in Tampa and Melbourne have had two of
our
Construction Contracts for Dept of Juvenile Justice put on indefinite
hold
($15 million).  As you will recall, these are 90% Federally funded with
the
money available to spend now.  The Juvenile Justice project in
Seffner($7.3
million)  has been ready  to break ground since December of 2001.  The
project was stopped two weeks prior to our notice to proceed.

This has been quite a challenge for our company and to date, we have not
been successful in  replacing that revenue for the year 2002.
Additionally,
we are currently contracted for work at the Lowell Correctional
Institution,
(Ocala)  with a need for budget approval for our contract to be
continued.
My understanding is that the budget request from DOC does not have much
support at this time.

While my first concern is my company, I want to take the opportunity to
once
again make certain that you are aware that your directive to "boost the
economy through construction is NOT what is being funded".  Small
business
comprises the heartbeat of our state.  As a small business employer of
50
people, responsible for their families, I must tell you that without
construction project funding for state projects, we will take a huge
loss as
well as loose employees.  Our annual revenue is appx $50 million, we are
in
our 14th year of business, this is our worst year yet.

With all that you are responsible for, please check to make certain that
construction funding is getting the attention you intended.  We need
your
help.  Please let me know who I should speak with regarding funding for
the
contracts we currently hold.

Sincerely and
with my full support,

Rebecca Smith, President
The A.D. Morgan Corporation

to Washington.  He asked about you and sends his best.  He also,
encouraged
me to make certain to follow up and let you know what was happening with
our
contracts.

Thanks again for your attention.  See you in Tampa on your next visit if
not
the Republican Victory Committee Dinner.

Dear Dean,
Thank you for your comments and your support.  This is such a difficult
time for all of us who work in the social services.  It is my fervent hope
that this tragic event will help all of us to learn how to better do our
jobs, and to let the public know of the challenges we face.  Hopefully, it
will bring about the positive result of infusing a sense of passion and
commitment in all Floridians that reaches the level of Governor Bush's --
we can and must do better.  Your kind words mean a lot to me and my family.
Judge Kearney

Dear Fellow FCC,

The email below is well done and should be read and remembered by all of
us.
DCF has been criticized severly and I feel unfairly in many instances by
the
press  It is unfortunate that a few employees of DCF have tarnished the
reputation of all of the employees who continue to do a superb job.

No organization is perfect and certainly DCF has had some problems but all
in
all they are doing a good job with a shortage of funding and personnel. If
you agree I hope you will let the department know that they have your
support. As you know,  Kathleen Kearney cannot micro manage every single
activity of DCF yet her resignation is being called for in some circles.
This is unfair and shows ignorance of the circumstances.

Dean Parker

             A Message from Secretary Kearney to DCF Employees

 As most of you know if you have been watching the news, our Department is
 receiving an enormous amount of scrutiny from the public, the legislature
 and the media over Rilya Wilson, a 5-year-old girl from Miami, who was in
 our care and has disappeared.

 I know you share my grave concern for Rilya and my fervent hope that we
 will find her alive and well.  Right now, we are in Miami making sure we
 are doing everything possible to help law enforcement officials find Rilya
 and to support all of you in making sure that every child in the care of
 the Department is safe.

 Unfortunately, in the news, we hear nothing about the hundreds of
 thousands of the lives saved and those made better by your work.  Last
 year, you took 390,365 calls to our abuse hotline; you investigated
 176,625 child abuse or neglect cases; you protected more than 44,000
 children from further abuse or neglect; and you found permanent loving
 homes for 2,008 of our foster children.

 I deeply regret that the unscrupulous actions of a few employees have cast
 a shadow on the entire agency and that this situation has made it even
 more difficult for each of you to get your job done.  I know how concerned
 you are every day with the safety and well being of all of the children we
 protect and families we serve.

 There are many other people who also understand your work and dedication.
 Governor Bush has given us his full support and has proved over and over
 that he understands the enormous demands of our work on behalf of
 Florida's most vulnerable citizens.

 In closing, I want to share with you a few excerpts from a lengthy letter
 of support we recently received:

      After reading Sunday's "Sun-Sentinel" front-page story criticizing
      DCF, I felt that I had to write you, not to join the criticism, but
      to give you and the Florida DCF staff some support.  I know what your
      jobs and careers are like.  I gave thirty-one years of my life to the
      system in Ohio.  When I retired in 1998 I was the Assistant Director
      of the Hamilton County (Cincinnati) Department of human Services and
      had responsibility for the Children's services, Child Support and
      income Maintenance Divisions of the Department.

      I know what a heart breaking experience it is to have a child death
      occur while that child is in the care of the child welfare system.  I
      know how social workers feel when they read in the newspapers how
      incompetent they are because one of their peers had a child in
      his/her caseload die.  I know how angry they feel when they believe
      that a peer was negligent on the job and could have contributed to
      the harm or death of a child.  I know how angry they feel when they
      believe that a peer was negligent on the job and did everything he or
      she could have to help a family, but still a child died.

      For some reason, everyone not employed in the field of child welfare,
      is an expert in the field.  Those of us who choose to work in the
      field of child welfare seem to be the least expert in the field, at
      least according to the media and the general public.  Those of us who
      have worked in the field know how badly it hurts to receive such
      criticism at the time of a tragedy such as a child death.  We rarely
      know how it feels to receive sympathy or empathy when such a tragedy
      occurs.  Even more rare is to know how it feels to receive praise for
      the good work we have done.

      Please accept my support and gratitude for the good work you and your
      staff across the state of Florida do to help children and families.
      Please tell your exceptional, caring social workers, supervisors,
      managers and administrators that a great job they do day in and day
      out and how much they matter to the children and families they serve.
      Please let them know that there are people who know what they do
      everyday and that we appreciate what they do and what they feel each
      and every day of the week for the children and families with whom
      they work.  Please tell your competent staff members that they are
      valued and that they need to be strong to overcome the negative media
      attention.  The children and families they each serve need them in
      their lives.  Things will not get better for the children if the
      good, caring workers are no longer employed by DCF.

      (Letter from Linda Simonds, Delray Beach, Fla.)

I am tremendously proud of you and the difficult work you perform so
competently on a routine basis.  In this time of crisis, let us affirm and
uphold each other in continuing to serve the most vulnerable Floridians to

Kathleen

Sorry about the title . . . you sent a fax to the Commissioner and requested
a response today concerning a Sam Ard email to Slater Bayliss concerning the
STS International and a project they want to brief to Gov Ridge on May 23rd.
The primary request was for someone to attend the meeting with them.

They will not brief Gov Ridge but two other members of his staff.

The explanation of the project that I received from Sam Ard today was
unclear and it appears the project is not ready for the kind of support they
request.

I briefed Commissioner and recommend we send no one to this meeting.

Dear Governor, 

Thank you for your time this afternoon.  You were very kind to take the time to listen.    I hope that the concerns I expressed are wrong, but, if not, I'd like the air to be cleared. 

You looked great, and I was reminded again of what a fair, loyal person you are. 

On another note, your decision not to reinstate Rudy Maloy was a good one.  I doubt if you will hear any complaints about it.

Governor,
 
We are all very excited and pleased that you are coming to see us.  I do want you to know that we have had a pilot group of 4 teams (2 care managers and one care team coordinator) working since January and have just transferred the first third (1,500 children) of the caseload from DCF to HKI on May 6th.  You will be coming to a temporary office location that we are using while the permanent location is getting renovated.
 
Once you arrive we will have a number of our community partners and leaders there to greet you.  Then we will go into our conference room with the core of our frontline staff that are listed below.  A number of these folks are transfers from DCF to us and will be able to tell you the difference, although we are still really new.
 
Our staff and DCF locally have been working very hard on this transition, it is very difficult but we are very energized and enthusiastic.  We will finish transitioning the rest of the caseload in a couple of more steps by November.
 
Carl and I will ride with you from the High School to our center.
 
See you tomorrow!!
 
Chris

jeb, i am sorry to miss the bill signing in tampa; but jim and john will be 
there......the bill is another step in the journey toward meaningful reform

 .....the florida's board conclusion on the community college four year 
degree is a terrific outcome...reward the system and mdcc for its 
entrepeneurial spirit and grit and success; tweak the universities so they 
are not quite so haughty. and yet leave the community college system squarely 
in place and make no inclination toward altering the community college 
mission or focus....

i have been asked to evaluate the job performance of jim horne; and it is a 
subject that we should discuss as opposed to reduce to writing....i believe 
that you and i together need to address the issues which persist there....
..
and i hope at the bill signing or sometime soon you might take the 
opportunity to attack the graham proposal, which i hope you understand to be 
far more substantial than you or anyone in your office appreciated......why 
create another layer of bureacracy? why segregate the universities when the 
solutions to our problems are all K-20?; why alter the system and create 
massisve uncertainty in a system which is just commencing with great 
success?; the regents were not a successful model ......
jeb, thanks again for the opportunity to serve...i am having fun

revision, articulation of  edison's  AS degrees into four year bacalaurete

Dear Armando: 

As you may be aware, President Bush will be visiting Miami on May 20th  to commemorate Cuba's Independence with the tens of thousands of proud Cuban-Americans here in our community; this is a wonderful gesture on the President's part. I'd like to enlist your support and capacity for influencing those in the White House in a suggestion that I feel our President and the Miami community would greatly appreciate and embrace.  You'll no doubt agree that visits to Miami by high officials are known to include a taste of cafecito and the "Viva Cuba Libre" theme - very typical, predictable and often jeered at by the media in that regard.  

Therefore, I'd like you to help me suggest  to the White House that the President use part of his valuable time that day emphasizing the accomplishments of Cuban-Americans and what they've been able to achieve under a system of freedom and democracy.  The President could visit Miami -Dade Community  College  in the heart of Little Havana,  where thousands of Cuban-Americans through hard work and sacrifice are commendably getting the necessary training to be able to join the ranks of working Americans.  This is also the place from which thousands of leading Cuban-American professionals have emerged. The President would be able to witness and speak first hand about the way in which Cubans and other immigrants have equipped themselves, through education and tranining, and are contributing in a worthwhile way to the welfare of our nation.  I truly feel that the President would welcome the opportunity to experience this wonderful example of how "America - the Free"  has given Cuban-Americans the opportunity to be able to do their part toward  becoming productive, contributing Americans.  


Armando, let me know what you think! M-DCC is the higher education institution that enrolls the highest numbers of Hispanics (of any U.S. College or university) and awards the highest number of Associate's degrees.  We are ready to roll out the Red Carpet for our President, and I know you're in a position to talk to the right people to help make this happen!!!

	I look forward to hearing from you.  Thank you. 
  
Sincerely, 
  
Eduardo

Governor Bush, 
All we have ever wanted is for Kirsty to be evaluated as a whole student who happens to have two very unique and severe disabilities; not just numbers on a test score sheet.  Once she is viewed as a whole student, we believe it will be obvious that she has the knowledge and potential to succeed and should not be denied a standard diploma and a college education because her disabilities interfere with her ability to pass a section of the FCAT.
Thank you again,
Chuck and Anne Edwards

Dear Governor Bush,
Thank you for taking time to meet with Kirsty today.  What a wonderful experience it was for her to be able to share her concerns for her future with you.  
  
You asked a very logical question regarding how many memory aids she might need for a test like the FCAT. After some thought, our answer would have to be that disabled students should have the right to use any and all accommodations during the FCAT that are written on their IEP's or 504 plans.  Unfortunately, Kirsty's disorder is not logical and it is difficult to answer such a question in logical terms because it follows no pattern...there is no rhyme or reason to her anxiety/panic attacks.  She can't predict when an anxiety/panic attack might occur therefore, she must always be prepared.   She makes her own memory aids for every test; that is how she studies. Access to recall during an anxiety/ panic attack is a memory issue which is the reason why we pursued the memory aid as an accommodation because it is appropriate to her individualized needs.  The color coded memory aids were her own concoction to help her  build bridges over her individual disabilities.  Each color serves to access a memory file and relieve anxiety/panic when needed. When she doesn't need them, she doesn't use them.
 
There were years when Kirsty couldn't complete ANY tests due to her disability.  She'd turn in blank tests and then have to suffer the ridicule that followed. Her self -esteem was as low as her grades. Conference after conference, we were told Kirsty isn't studying enough to pass the tests. Year after year, she worked in class and made A's, only to end up with a C's or lower because she failed the tests or the finals.  
 
We are enormously proud of Kirsty and her sheer determination and all she has been able to accomplish; from the little girl whom we were told was borderline retarded to the well spoken young lady she is today.  Many people have tried to encourage Kirsty to give up and quit school, get her GED and get on with her life. She believes she has proven through her grades that she has earned the standard diploma, her VPA seal, and the right to walk with her peers in a cap and gown. There is no single test that is indicative of her knowledge or intelligence. 
 
Thank you again for keeping your commitment to meet with her today. You created an opportunity of a lifetime; one she'll never forget and one we are appreciative of having been a part.  We hope that Kirsty was able to offer you a glimpse into her unique world.
 
Sincerely,
Chuck and Anne Edwards

Governor,

Greetings from Miami-Dade County.  I did not get up to Tallahassee this
session, but I hope it went fine from your perspective.  I also hope
this
e-mail finds you and your family well.

I am writing to invite you to an event I am hosting on May 20th.  As you
are
very well aware, this May 20 is the 100th anniversary of Cuban
statehood.  I
suspect you will be in Miami for some of those events.  It is also the
100th
anniversary of the raising of the Cuban flag over Cuba.  General Emilio
Nunez raised the flag on that day.  His grandson, Ricardo Nunez
Portuondo (I
believe you know him and his family well) is on my Commission staff and
I am
honoring his family and that special event.  As you may know, Ricardo
was
the first Cuban-American to receive a Presidential Appointment (by Pres.
Ford to run the Cuban Refugee Program) and has been quite a community
leader. 

His grandson, therefore the great-great grandson of General Nunez, will
hoist the flag to commemorate the 100th anniversary.  It will take place
at
Noon, which was when the original flag was hoisted.  The event takes
place
on Cuban Memorial Boulevard, which is at the intersection of S.W. 8th
Street
and 13th Avenue.  Many Cuban exile organizations have been invited.

I would be quite honored if you would be in attendance.  I am sure that
you
have a busy schedule, but I think this will be a special event,
particularly
with the role played by such a prominent family in the history of Cuba
and
the Cuban exile.  I have also heard a rumor that your brother and our
President might be in town that day.  He is certainly welcome to attend
and
I would certainly arrange the event in such a way so as to accommodate
either you or your brother.  Please let me know.

In the meantime, all my best wishes!

The funding for the program is from uncollected sales taxes that have not been remitted to the State.  The pilot program has been operating in Jacksonville for many years and we would like for you to consider coming to Jacksonville to sign the bill.  The collection of the funds will be from the States Attorney Office.
 
You will be a big hit on this bill with the disabled community that ususally votes Democratic... Let me know what I can do for you... I only wish we had more real Republicans in the Senate.

Dear Mrs.. Bailey,
 
I have no idea who you have spoken with however, I can tell you they have misled you if they have told you what you describe in your e-mail. I will explain where we are with rules in just a moment but, I first want to thank you for your concerns for your children and those children you have welcomed into your family. People like yourself are blessed with a gift of caring and a willingness to reach out to those less fortunate and I am grateful for your effort and wish you continued blessing in your life.
 More to the point of your concern, First let me point out no rules have been proposed ,our work group is working to developed rules, which coalitions  will follow in order to comply with the School Readiness Act.
Currently, we are discussing the eligibility requirements under the School Readiness Act which governs all school readiness programs. School based readiness programs have replaced the pre-kindergarten program formerly controlled by the local school district. Local coalition made up of local community leaders have responsibility to design and implement school readiness programs that match the needs of your local community. These programs are required by statute to offer a variety of choices and settings for parents to choose. School based ,Private based,and Faith based providers all of whom must conduct developmentally appropriately programs should be available for parental choice.
The School Readiness Act in the intent section clearly point out that  these programs " be developmentally appropriate,researched based,involve parents as the Childs first teacher,serve as preventive measures for children at risk of future school failure,enhance the educational readiness of eligible children and support family education". The Act further states that "school readiness programs be operated on a full-day, year round basis to the maximum extent possible to enable parents to work and become financially self-sufficient.
Clearly the Legislature has pointed out two of the purposes of readiness are to help "at risk" children with preparedness for school and to help families become self sufficient. The statute also points out nothing in this act is intended to:"Relieve parents or guardians of their own obligations to ready their children for school or create any obligation to provide publicly funded school readiness programs or services beyond those authorized by the Legislature".
Children with disabilities ( speech impediments) are one of the eligible groups who are prioritized for school readiness programs which means your son will likely qualify for school readiness in your community.
Your e-mail is not specific as to whether your school district will be participating in the readiness programs. Hopefully. if your school district will participate , you will have the choice of setting and location at a school based site, for your son.
Another part of the readiness programs are the qualitative out reach programs to work with stay at home parents to assist them with their responsibility to prepare their children for school . I would suggest you attend your local coalition meetings and learn more about the unique programs that are being developed by your coalition for your community.
Finally, as to your concern about the work issue our discussions have revolved around how to best use the limited resources we have to serve Florida's children. None of us want to usurp the responsibility of parents to prepare their children for school and we  want to help as many families as possible to be come self sufficient . With that in mind we have discussed setting a priority for two income families falling below the 150% level, with the knowledge that a stay at home parent could engage in the preparedness of their children more readily than a family where both parents work.
From the tone of your e-mail I believe you have been misled by those who have an agenda other than school readiness, which I regret. Change is difficult and when we are trying to change ingrained institutional practices a considerable amount of turf protection and effort is expended by those who desire to maintain the status quo.
Please accept my best wishes for the future of your children and your self . Should you wish to discuss this issue further or any other readiness aspect, please feel free to call me a 407-859 -6635.
 
All the best, Butch

Dear Sir or Madam,
 
Thank you for taking the time to read my email. I have never felt the need to write to any government office or elected official before but because of the information that I received recently I fell compelled to speak for my son.
First a little background on myself. I am a former foster parent who has adopted two beautiful children from the state of Florida. My daughter, age 5, is just finishing her first wonderful year of pre-k. My son, age 4, has been talking about going to pre-k for the past year and so looking forward to it. He has a speech impediment and I was calling the school ESE supervisor to find out when he was to be evaluated by the speech therapist and she informed me that the Rule Development Workgroup has advised Childhood Development Services of Citrus County that they have just passed a new rule that the children, in order to be qualified to be in the pre-k program must have two working parents. Both parents must be employed and work at least 20 hours a week. Then I was told that my son does not qualify now and will not be able to attend school.
I am shocked beyond belief that the members of the Rule Development Workgroup and other members of legislature in our fine state are so non-family oriented. If I were to get a job to meet these new requirements I would have to put my children in a daycare. I have no one who can watch them. I can not believe that the members of the coalition would rather see a child go to a care giver than to their home where a loving parent is there for them. Being a former foster parent and also talking to the Citrus County Foster Parent Supervisor, I know that the Department of Children and Families strongly supports a stay at home parent. 
Please, listen to my words. I am so determined to reverse this terrible decision that I have already written a similar letter to Mr. and Mrs. Jeb Bush, Frank Brogen, and anyone else who will listen to my words. Who will see the injustice being done to me and to my son. We are all so interested in bringing back family values and to improving education. Parents at home for their children is the best thing and it has been proven. I feel that I and my son are being punished for me being a stay at home mother and that the coalition has lost sight of these values.
 I am very active in my daughters school and the programs that are offered for parents to participate in. Just recently I attended a "Tea Party for Mothers Day" at my daughters school. There were only one third of the mothers there and the children were so sad that their mothers were not able to attend to see them. I was so happy that I was able to attend and brought my son along. I felt so proud of my daughter and her accomplishments and felt an overwhelming sense of sadness for my son who will not be able to have this wonderful opportunity because of this new ruling. 
My priorities are straight. My children come first. It seems to me that the Rule Development Workgroup have lost sight of their priorities in putting education and children's needs first. My daughter has benefited tremendously from this program. My son will too if given the chance.  This is not  a glorified babysitting program. 
We do qualify for the program financially and if the job stipulation is enforced we will no longer qualify because we will be over income. I feel like we are caught between a rock and a hard place. 
I know that there are many parents in the same situation that I am in. I hope to start speaking to them soon and we will all join our voices together to let you all know that a wrong decision has been made. I am planning to attend the meeting on June 5, 2002 and I hope to speak not only for myself but for all the the parents and children that will not have this first step in a life time of education that will shape a child's future and allow them to reach untold heights if this decision is not reversed.
Sincerely,
Dianne Bailey

Dear Mr. Governor, 
 
As you may know, for the past ten (10) years I have been extensively involved, as a community service , in programs that help address various issues facing our school age kids.  Issues such as school violence, drug abuse, suicide, bullying/harassment, among others, have been statistically proven to be a deterrent to safe schools and effective learning.  Obviously, the Columbine type tragedies that have become a part of our children’s everyday reality are yet greater examples of deterrents to education.
 
Given your well-known commitment to education and children, I thought you would best appreciate my excitement about having identified a school safety program, designed and brought to my attention by a recently retired top executive of The Wackenhut Corporation, that is modeled after the recommendations from studies conducted by many of our nation’s law enforcement agencies.  
 
The program, to be administered by a for-profit company, consists of a national centralized system for the collection of intelligence regarding our nation’s schools and their respective students, teachers, and administration.  This intelligence is immediately disseminated to the proper authorities for appropriate action.  The main objective of the program is to act as a proactive measure to thwart activities that threaten the safety of those affiliated with a given school, using a national hotline, sophisticated proprietary software (designed by IBM), and highly trained and qualified personnel from professionals fields including law enforcement, intelligence, crisis negotiation, psychology, sociology, and education. 
 
Additionally, I am particularly proud that the company’s plans include locating its national headquarters in Palm Beach County, Florida, and will initially employ over 300 people.
 
I would very much appreciate the opportunity to meet with you in order to better inform you about the program, and how it is right in-line with your education platform.  I am confident that once you learn more about its mechanics you will agree that this innovative approach will provide a very effective means of addressing most of the problem issues facing our schools and youth today.  
 
Please contact me at your earliest convenience through my office (305) 461-2440 extension 115, or e-mail address ( es@landstarhomes.com), if you are interested in learning more about this program.   As always, I would very much welcome the opportunity to meet with you in Tallahassee, or any other location of your choosing.   
 
Warmest personal regards from your friend,

Greetings Governor Bush. Thank you for the recent note and support through
Brett Doster. On a similar front, I have been working with a group that
identifies and prepares minority entrepreneurs for receiving equity funding
and then connects them with venture capitalists.  The Emerging Venture
Network (EVN) is a not-for-profit organization that has had a high success
rate in assisting high-growth minority entrepreneurs. Six of the 15
companies they presented to investors last November have already received
funding. 

Florida's commitment to investing state pension funds in venture capital
funds may signal a strong commitment to creating high-growth businesses, and
thus jobs, in the State of Florida.   The other half of the equation is
identifying and developing businesses that have the potential to be venture
backed.  EVN's success, coupled with industry statistics, suggests that
investors have not sufficiently tapped into minority deals.  In today's
market, minority firms garner 2-3% of venture capital dollars despite being
one of the fastest growing business sectors.  As home to the US' 3rd largest
metro area for minority business - Miami -- and a diverse population
statewide, Florida can build a competitive advantage by tapping into venture
deals that may otherwise go unidentified. I think we briefly discussed
Florida's need to either build an angel investor network or find strong
catalysts to support budding entrepreneurs. EVN coordinates both. 

I would like to recommend EVN as a resource to the state and ask you to
identify a person in the Governor's office with whom they should work to
coordinate further exposure to any young Florida entrepreneurial community.
Through this email, I would also like to introduce you to Michelle Garcia,
one of EVN's co-founders who runs the Miami office. Please let us know any
proper course of action EVN can take with your administration to come online
throughout the State of Florida. Please let either of us know if you have
any questions.

Again thank you for taking the time and I wish you continued success.

To Whom It May Concern:

This serves as a letter of reference for Carrie Dunn, who has been our
daughter's kindergarten teacher for the last school year.  We wanted to take
this step in an effort to assist her in any future vocational opportunities
as they may emerge.  It is our honor to recommend Mrs. Dunn. While we have
only known Carrie Dunn since August 2001, we have been very impressed with
both her skills as an academic instructor and with her professionalism and
demeanor as a role model and mentor to her large class of students.  She has
demonstrated outstanding talents in both the administrative/managerial
aspects of her role as well as the academic instruction responsibilities.
Carrie has an excellent reputation among the fellow parents as a superb
kindergarten teacher at Pride Elementary School. 

Revealing of her abilities, Carrie has consistently taken the initiative to
significantly expand and augment the core academic program, especially as
individual student scenarios might dictate.  She works very diligently to
assist those students that might require additional attention or assistance,
and she also enhances the scope of learning for those students who may be
learning at an accelerated level.  We have been very pleased with our
daughter, Brianna's, personal growth and development on many fronts over the
last school year.  The academic transition has been truly astounding.
Brianna is now reading and comprehending at a second-grade level.  She is
able to read and navigate alone on children's websites online. Brianna can
read nearly every storybook that we have ever purchased for her to her
younger sister.  She is also able to write in sentence and paragraph form
with very few errors in structure or spelling.  We could not be more
pleased.

Carrie Dunn has also demonstrated tremendous skill at navigating through the
disciplinary and other issues that sometimes arise in such a diverse mix of
students and parents.  She maintains a well structured yet nurturing
environment for her classroom of 30+ students.  Carrie Dunn has
distinguished herself as a superb teacher in our opinion.  We have actively
participated in most school functions, both during and outside school hours.
We have had tremendous exposure to her leadership and academic skills, even
with the younger siblings of her students. Her competence, compassion and
ethics as an instructor of young children are exemplary.  In providing a
broad spectrum of support, care giving and instruction, Carrie has more than
proven her ability to lead a large and complex classroom environment. 

Carrie Dunn's commitment to education and teaching is highlighted by the
success of her students at Pride Elementary.  We are deeply impressed by
Carrie's efforts above-and-beyond the "call of duty" and recommend her
unhesitatingly for any similar role. I am confident that in the future she
would provide the same high level of service and commitment.  If you have
any questions or wish to speak further about Carrie Dunn, please feel free
to contact us directly at 813.220.5462.

Sincerely,

Sonja and Kevin Ward

Governor,
You may recall that Victoria Freeman wrote to you asking not to be removed
from a Local mental heath advocacy council.  Her local advocacy council and
the Statewide Advocacy Council recommended that you remove her because of
her conduct.  I received and reviewed the allegations against her submitted
by the advocacy councils.  Although apparently a full hearing was held by
the Statewide Advocacy Council on her removal, the documentation they
submitted to us is too unclear about the reasons why they think she should
be removed for an informed decision to be made.  I plan to send the
Statewide Advocacy Council a letter explaining the type of additional
information we need for you to make an informed decision about her removal
and give them a chance to provide such information.  I've spoken with the
folks at the Statewide Advocacy Council and they're fine with that.  They

Med waver program

I am a mother 74 years who became a widow last September.  My
daughter,Donna Gail Speropulos, is a mentally challenged  42 year old
individual who is on the waiting list for these services.  She attended
McDonald Training Center for a number of years and Steve Griffith, who
was her case worker at that time, dropped her from the program because
Donna stopped going there.  He didn"t inform us that he had done this.
This was 23 years ago.   When we applied for these services,which we
were not aware of until last year, we discovered this problem. He did
not seek to find a placement for her in another program.  My husbands
demise has placed us in a  situation where I am in dire need of these
services.  Please  work with diligence to help all of us who are waiting
on these services. Keep up the good work you are doing !!  Sincerely,
Virginia Speropulos

Dear Jeb
I want to wish you all the luck in the world as you seek re-election.
May I also strongly urge the abandonment of the proposal that the INS is
floating around, to restrict foreign visitors to 30 days per year in the
US. Florida of course, would be particularly hard hit and in my opinion, it
would not achieve any of its desired objectives. Once someone enters the US
for even one day, they can dissapear if they so choose. Even a thirty day
period would make it nearly impossible to find such a person. Additionally,
the potential that troublemakers are US citizens negates this initiative.
So many have dual citizenships.
something has to be done to ensure better security, but that could be said
for the rest of the world as well. This knee jerk reaction makes absolutely
no sense and of course harms the innocents.
Still looking forward to a golf game with you and Ed one of these days.
Best regards, Bill Shenkman

Subject: Cleaned up version of violations




Greetings; 
This is to inform you of a company possibly in violation of criminal and civil law. 
This company needs to be stopped and I have been telling people about this company for over three years. 
The company is: Jacobson Resonance Enterprise, Inc. 
stock symbol:  JRSE 
1.)Dr. Jerry I. Jacobson practicing medicine without a license. 
(holds  an inactive dentistry New York license) 
2.) side effects of the use of the resonator 
(Mentioned  children having side effects and can be backed up by FDA side effects letter MedWatch) 
3.) Dr. Jerry I. Jacobson -  Medical malpractice. 
(Practicing medicine treating, charging, consulting without a license especially on brain injured children and adults and anyone else, performing neurological clinical trials in the state of Florida) 
4.) SEC filings to include Form 10KSB inaccurate statements 
(SEC filing show inaccurate statements ) 
5.) Violations of FDA regulations 
(Proof in FDA warning letters, IRB standards and regulations, IDE  etc.) 
6.) Possible, Illegal activity regarding the donation and sale of JRSE stock. 
(America Charitable, Perspectivsim  only questioned this and who benefited from  the sale of this stock,  I personally don't know enough about IRS to call this either way, the board members and directors of America Charitable,Perspecitivism, and JRSE are cross linked) 
7.) Misrepresentations in Medical Daily March, 2001 article posted on their website www.jrse.com 
(FDA submission hopefully within the next few months, article written in 2001, JRSE claimed they did this in 1999) 
8.) JRSE  Cornell Mouse Study 
(questioning the nerve regeneration mouse study and Cornell's involvement, so far Cornell has not claimed any knowledge of such a study.  Principal investigator Dr. Brij Saxena) 
9.) Illegal use of Michael Sayih's likeness 
(used Michael ( my son)on Internet for over two years, and on bogus fund raiser ,they used him to raise money for stock and not charity) 
10.) Conducting an illegal fundraiser 
(America Charitable, funds never went for the treatment of the children) 
11.) Taking advantage of disabled children by taking money for treatment,parents flew here, stayed in hotels and at times stayed two weeks for treatment 
(Dr.Jacobson obviously does not  have a license or FDA safety approval) 
12.) Dr. Frank Chaviano lying about the use of funds received for    
(Frank said at the fund raiser "Not one penny of this money will be used for overhead it will all go to the children"  anyone who was there will tell you this, also cannot find a license or a degree for him nor has he shownproof of one yet.  He has also boasted on various documents that he received the governor's Heritage Award,  who?  Dr? or Mr. Frank Chaviano) 
13.) Possible, Medical malpractice by Dr. Roger S. Gorman, West Boca Hospital 
(Actually probably medical neglect since he was the principal investigate of the clinical trials and allowed non-licensed doctors to treat, consult and  charge patients) 
14.) Possible Violation of stating contract with NASA  (No contract or anyone at NASA to claim any relationship with JRSE.  No contract to be found   yet.  Notice NASA logo on the www.jrse.com <http://www.jrse.com/>  web site, click on the little Einstein and watch) 
15.) JRSE inaccurate statements about having an IRB Study 
(No valid IRB study proven by FDA warning letter, board members and directors also a part of JRSE and major stockholders of JRSE, showing vested interest) 
16.) Lying to patients' families about safety and credentials, claiming device is safe for the children and adults. 
(We have this on tape) 
17.coehorsed me (Patricia) into signing Settlement agreement in order to receive my last paycheck 
( two weeks after the clinic temporarily shut down operation, thus keeping me from seeking my last promised pay, overtime etc.) 
18.) Inaccuracies in 1998 Private Placement Document 
(As can be seen in the private placement) 
19.) Possible Insurance fraud 
(One gentleman had his insurance pay for the treatment--have to look at appointment book to remember his name) 
20.) Misinformation about agreements with Triumph Sports Drink 
(Stonepoint (Canada) apparently never had a contract with JRSE.   I talked with Stonepoint’s president) 
21.) Withholding information regarding resonator side effects 
(JRSE claims no side effects, FDA side effects letter tells about side effects and on Jerry's protocols he makes notes about side effects) 
22.) Violation of FDA rules by promoting the sales of resonators in the US 
(Complete violation of CFR 21  under IDE abbreviated code) 
23.) Dr. Haltiwanger conducting unauthorized medical studies 
( He is not a neurologist and he had no IRB obviously? Using JRSE's IRB, license was restricted or revoked in the state of Georgia) 
24.) ADA - not protecting the rights of human subjects under clinical investigation 
(proof by FDA warning letter - no Informed consent or protection of human subjects  in a  clinical trial) 
25.)NASA relationship 
(NASA takes no claim so far to any relationship with Jerry so where is it? JRSE also claims, that Sen. Trent Lott introduced Jerry Jacobson and got Jerry's foot  in the door with NASA.  ????) 
26.) Fraud 
(Maybe thats JRSE's middle name fraud, sorry couldn't resist) 
27.) story of FBI chasing Jerry Jacobson out of New York 
(Story told by Jerry and Debbie and media newspaper publication) 
28.) Jerry possibly stopped patients from receiving needed medical treatments 
(little girl with AIDS, child on seizure medicine, Michael with leg surgery) 
29.)Possible Illegal operation of America Charitable Fund 
(Possibly in  violation of soliciting funds in Florida) 
30.) Possible Failure to report income from treatment of children and sale of resonators in the US 
(Never seen this on the SEC filing.  sometimes making $1200.00 a week) 
31.)  CE Mark in Europe ? 
(Question this because I think you obtain CE Mark by submitting data form the US, may  be in violation of FDA IDE abbreviated paragraph selling device outside of country and submitting  data to acquire CE Mark.) 


32.)sold private placement stock to financially unqualified individuals 


We have all documents, tapes, links, etc. to prove each violation. 
Please contact us.  I started with a small claims with this company over two years ago.  They have knee jerked me to no end.  My attorney  and I discovered more criminal charges rather than civil.  This company  is still in operation in Boynton Beach, Florida.  I am shocked that  this Jerry Jacoboson was allowed to treat and charge patients.  Remember this is the company that treated Ali as well. 

Myabe the media needs to place disclaimers when doing stories on medical news and devices so the public does not assume that they are being presented with facts that have been documented and researched.  People tend to believe what they read and see on the news 
www.jrse.com 
stock symbol:  JRSE 

My biggest question is, many families including myself brought our children and loved ones to this clinic to be treated based on, media, NASA,Cornell, Sen. Trentt Lott, etc.  If these organizations endorse this company did they know that Jerry Jacobson  is not a licensed doctor and the FDA never declared the device as being safe?  If they didn't or don't endorse the  company how come they have failed to notify the company to remove their names from the web site and press releases.  This has been going on for over three years. 

What is the connections of these organizations with JRSE?  And under what authority did they feel these clinical trials on human subjects could be done?

Dear Mr. Barreto,
 
This is in regard to the message sent to you by our mutual friend, J.R.
Steinbauer.  Since you don't know me, I thought it better that I also
contact you and introduce myself.
 
Valentino (Val) Macor
Member of the Board of Directors
French/American Chamber of Commerce

Liaison Officer from the Chamber to the office of the Mayor of Coral
Gables.

In addition to Mr. Steinbauer, I am also a lifelong friend of
Commissioner William Kerdyk, JR., who may also contact you regarding
this matter.
 
As you know, we have many Chambers of Commerce in this area, and the
major European ones have already committed to attending a dinner having
Governor Bush speak to us.
 
Because of the expected high number of attendees, we would like to plan
this event for him at the Coral Gables Biltmore, possibly the Country
Club room, which houses upward of 500 people.
 
We in the French Chamber think that a showing of the strongest members
of the Consular group would provide the Governor with a very visible
speaking platform, and that is why we decided to spearhead this project.
 
Of course, it goes without saying that if his brother would also come
down to show solidarity for the Governor, it could be a media coup for
both of them.
 
Another mutual friend of the Governor and myself is Jaques Turner,
Consul General of Luxembourg, who is also a member of our Board, and he
adds his wishes that you are successful if making this contact for us.
Thank you

Dear Secretary Kearney: 

      Please be aware that we families and consumers of DCF services here in District 7 support you and the DCF administrators, staff and workers who are dedicated to the well-being of our developmentally disabled population.  As a nurse, I can certainly sympathize, and possibly empathize, with you in the Miami situation.  The medical profession often faces many tragic situations and must deal with media scrutiny and "bad press."   
      We appreciate that the Department of Children and Families has a very broad scope of services under its wings.  It is difficult for one agency to handle all those critical issues involved with our children and families.  We are grateful that there are so many willing to devote their careers to helping the less fortunate in this state.  It is not easy and often under-appreciated.  Much progress had been made over the last three or more years.  We have seen it.  For instance, there is more open communication and more family and consumer involvement in the programs.  We pray that the wonderful progress that has been made will continue. 
      Thank you for your leadership and God Bless You! 

Sincerely, 

Phyllis A. Bridges

Attachments:	RE: 

Colleen:

# 1.
The calculations that are being used by the FSBA
appear to me to be short changing the participants by
29%.

The Present Value of Accumulated Benefits(PVAB)
calculation for each individual should be
representative of their accrued value to date -
period.  

The summation of each individual's PVAB should equal
the same amount that is being used for the DB plan.

According to my questions and Francis's answers, this
is not the case. 


# 2.
The FRS DB/DC web-site decision tutorial pages should
prominately provide descriptions of the components
that drive the PV - CASH OUT number. 2 of the FSBA
estimated numbers that make the biggest difference in
the CASH OUT calculations  are the earnings assumption
and and salary growth rate.  

The salary growth rate that is being used is 5%-10%
per year and is age dependent.  This is a very high
salary growth rate. 

I think that many people would be interested in
applying their own forecast in this area.  A lower
forward looking salary assumption would reduce the
amount of the future DB benefit.  This would change
the DB DC comparison. This would not change the Cash
OUT amount(depending on the answers to my #1 above),
but the individual's comparison of their DB payment to
a potential DC accumulation would be significantly
different.


This is one more unfortunate chapter in a book that
has been made far more expensive and difficult than is
necessary.

Regards,

Russell

 To Whom It May Concern:

 

            RE:  Charles Wesley Huggins, Jr. H05888

 

            I just received a call from my nephew, Chuck.  He has received a letter from Janet Keels’ office stating that the parole board has recommended that his request for waiver be denied.  I hope that this is not an indication of the thoughts of the whole board.  He has a good record and has tried very hard to do what he needs to do to steer clear of the drugs that are available in prison.  He is now working at the Fire College in Ocala and doing quite well.  I keep hearing that the prisons are overcrowded and the state is trying to come up with a way to release inmates that are not a threat to society and that have a good record.  I believe that my nephew is definitely an excellent candidate for that consideration. 

I don’t mean to beat a dead horse but the recent affair of a certain ball player really saddens me.  He has finally been put in prison for a very minimal time and yet not for the original crimes but for breaking parole, what a message that has sent to the rest of the world.  If you have money or a big name, you can do most anything and get a slap on the hand.  All my family and I are asking is that you grant my nephew the same courtesy.  No we don’t have a big name or any money, but we love him and want him home.  He has definitely matured in the 3 years he has been locked up and I believe that he can go out into the world and walk away from the temptations of drugs and alcohol.  He is a very bright young man who made some very stupid choices and he knows that now.  Please give him the opportunity to become a self-supporting, honest, law abiding citizen.  

If you don’t grant this, then if I understand what I have read, he will have to wait an additional two years before he can apply again.  I certainly hope that is not an avenue we are going to have to go down.  The middle class people of our society deserve the same considerations as the richer portion of society.  Please consider prayerfully before you make your decision.  

 

                                                                        Sincerely,

PS - I know you will be in Hillsborough County campaigning for equal education for everyone.  I wholeheartedly agree with that and I hope you have the same attitude about Chuck.

Subject: Emerging Venture Network


Greetings Governor Bush. Thank you for the recent note and support
through
Brett Doster. On a similar front, I have been working with a group that
identifies and prepares minority entrepreneurs for receiving equity
funding
and then connects them with venture capitalists.  The Emerging Venture
Network (EVN) is a not-for-profit organization that has had a high
success
rate in assisting high-growth minority entrepreneurs. Six of the 15
companies they presented to investors last November have already
received
funding. 

Florida's commitment to investing state pension funds in venture capital
funds may signal a strong commitment to creating high-growth businesses,
and
thus jobs, in the State of Florida.   The other half of the equation is
identifying and developing businesses that have the potential to be
venture
backed.  EVN's success, coupled with industry statistics, suggests that
investors have not sufficiently tapped into minority deals.  In today's
market, minority firms garner 2-3% of venture capital dollars despite
being
one of the fastest growing business sectors.  As home to the US' 3rd
largest
metro area for minority business - Miami -- and a diverse population
statewide, Florida can build a competitive advantage by tapping into

deals that may otherwise go unidentified. I think we briefly discussed
Florida's need to either build an angel investor network or find strong
catalysts to support budding entrepreneurs. EVN coordinates both. 

I would like to recommend EVN as a resource to the state and ask you to
identify a person in the Governor's office with whom they should work to
coordinate further exposure to any young Florida entrepreneurial
community.
Through this email, I would also like to introduce you to Michelle
Garcia,
one of EVN's co-founders who runs the Miami office. Please let us know
any
proper course of action EVN can take with your administration to come
online
throughout the State of Florida. Please let either of us know if you
have
any questions.

Again thank you for taking the time and I wish you continued success.

Just read where you passed the above-mentioned legislation.  It sounds good until you read where you have made it much more difficult to protest permitting, etc.. development.  Of course you did, your are a developer.  That is the main reason Florida schools are in trouble.  We have runaway development with no regard to the number of schools that will be needed.  With you as Govenor, Feeney in the house and King in the senate, Florida has built in enemies and we don't need to worry about foreign terrorists. 
We are going to implode.

Jeb:  
 
By the school system not providing appropriate ESY services, the state is most probably going to end up paying more money under other agencies. i.e. PCA, non res. hab., behavior therapy... under DDPO.  Lucy's is not the worst example, it probably is one of the best, so you can only imagine.   We do not need to be investing so much time and energy on this issue.  I do not understand why the system complicates matters so much.  We, do not want to be in an antagonistic position.  We fill pushed....  Not asking you to do anything for Lucy, but just to be aware of the situation as a systemic issue, and as we many need to do something more forceable, which we will try to avoid.

Thank you Gary!!  What a mess!!  At this point we are not sure that it will be safe for Lucy to attend the proposed ESY services.  It's a shame for those that do not have a back up system, but what I see happening is that the state is going to end paying more out of Waiver funds, and even though they are mandated by IDEA, the school system is going to be off the hook.  Most parents, teachers, aides, bus drivers do not know at this point in they have a program, a job, and if they do where, and if the services are in place. I understand that our district will be sending a letter to all those that qualified for ESY services asking if they are still planning to attend.  It's fair to assumed that many will say NO because the services are not considered appropriate. In our case, we can not allow for Lucy to be DUMPED in a new setting (middle school) without competent staff that can ensure her an appropriate and safe program. Not only is it going to be a segregated setting, but Lucy is 20 years old, and should not be attending a Middle School.   Do you think that we should file a formal complain with the state DOE?  IDEA is vague on this area, and I am not sure what to do.  I have been trying to avoid to litigate, but I wonder if we are being force to use that avenue,

Hi Jill,
 
Very nice to hear from you. We have no 'regular' program set up that would be appropriate for Lucy, but she is welcome to return as a volunteer with our WorkAble Solutions project the way she did last year. It was wonderful having her and we certainly would welcome her back. We were able to customize a series of activities for her last year that seemed to work out fairly well.
 
In terms of logistics, Lucy would have to come with her aide, of course, and the same set of equipment and materials. We also need a name stamp for her, which I mentioned to Robin at the IEP. She needs to bring the following at each visit:
Big Mac
Step by Step
Spin Art
Trigger Sound
Switch adapted tape player
Power Link
Name Stamp
Lunch
 
She can come 1-2 days a week starting the week of June 24th (we have camp the week before). Tuesdays and Thursdays would be best. The 5 days/week in weeks 1 and 5 would not be the best set up for us. Last year the times were 10-1, if I remember correctly, but we have some flexibility there.
 
I will need to have the family fill out a case history form since we are making this a bit more formal. Berthy, can you give me an address where I can have those forms sent? Also, I will need to see her for speech tx a few times while she is with us as this is part of our WorkAble Solutions model. I would work on collaboration with her aide in developing a program for her to do while she is with us, and then monitor it, retraining as needed. This would need to be included in her Medicaid POC, I believe, if that is to be the funding source for her therapy.
 
Let me know ASAP if this is workable so that I can make the appropriate arrangements on this end. There is a bit more competition for slots and I need to act quickly to save one for Lucy.

Carole

Subject: Request from Congressman Bilirakis


Congressman Bilirakis called Karen (personally) to ask if the Governor
would
be willing to testify at a congressional field hearing that he will be
hosting on Monday morning, June 3rd, somewhere in the Tampa Bay area.
The
hearing will focus on medical mal-practice insurance rates and the
growing
lack of accessibility, particularly in the OB-GYN field.

Congressman Bilirakis is aware that the Governor has been concerned
about
this issue and that the Governor has pushed for tort reform in the past.
Bilirakis understands that it's a "long shot," but wanted to
ask---hoping
that the Gov will add a special touch!
If the Governor is not available, Bilirakis has asked for our assistance
in
getting the insurance commissioner to participate.

They will also have as witness a representative from a malpractice
insurance
company to discuss a multi-state approach and the experience they have
had
in states such as California who have premium caps.

Of course, he has asked for some feed back as soon as conveniently
possible.
Thanks.

Subject:	RE: Incase you missed my last message

Governor, Mike and I discussed . . . . Here are Mike's thoughts -- I would only add that ideally, in the years ahead, Health Flex would be expanded to include populations such as David's -- part of the problem, as Mike notes, is the high cost of insurance due to mandates and regulation.  Health Flex should be the norm, not the exception:
 
Health flex may not directly help him, but it will potentially help tens of thousands of other low income uninsured in Florida.  And there is a provision in the bill which allows for limited benefit policies for all small groups (the modified Farkas language) which he could take advantage of..
 
In terms of insurance carriers having not demonstrating any interest in keeping insurance costs low, he is way off base.  The insurance industry and HMO industry have offer dozens of proposals to keep costs low, and most of their time is spent fighting off special interests who want to add mandated benefits and coverages which increase costs.  He is also not aware of the role that the insurance commissioner plays in holding down rate increases through approval of all rate increases.
 
In terms of the groups of one issue, the reform is not meant to help him, but rather to help groups of 2 - 50 whose costs are being driven up as a result of the high cost of including groups of one.  Groups of  one are gaming the system and shifting their costs to other small groups.  Ideally, groups of one should be in the individual market where there is no community rating.  But since we have no high risk pool, we added them into the small group market if they can prove they are self employed.

Governor,

 

You wanted to know my suggestion on how I would deal with the issue of the single-insured in the new Healthcare Plan.

 I will try to be brief.  But since this is not my area of expertise, I may be a trifle long...please bear with me.

 

I have briefly scanned through SB 46-I Health Care bill, mainly the "clean claim" section, the pilot health flex plan and the single insured provision.  

 

Since I view the primary reason for higher medical premiums almost exclusively on uncontrolled medical costs, forcing carriers to pay medical providers before a clean claim will simply allow the medical industry to gouge the consumer even more.  The clean claim proviso will make it even harder for carriers to hold down medical costs, or even develop an incentive to do so.

 

Governor, I am a court reporter. All I do all day long is take EUOs (examination under oaths) and IMEs (independent medical examination) testimony. Under our present structure there is no incentive for medical providers to cut costs. And as long as the insurance industry can simply go to the state and raise premiums to meet rising costs, they will not play their natural and vital role in reducing costs -- that leaves the consumer virtually powerless and defenseless. We should be passing laws that strengthen the insurance carrier's hands in making sure these medical costs are reasonable, necessary and affordable.  The mere fact that insurance carriers are not asking the Legislature for more tools to address rising medical costs tells me the direction of this bill is headed in the wrong direction.

 

The health flex pilot plan is designed to help provide medical coverage for the uninsured whose family gross income equals to or less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level, about $30,000 per year. I make around $60,000 a year, gross. I pay about $800 per month in medical coverage for my wife, daughter and myself. This amount is due to go up to $890 next year. I will not be able to afford 150 percent increase on this amount. I also will not qualify for your health flex plan at present, neither will a lot of other one-life groups. There is at present no safety net for us. The health flex plan must be far more developed to insure that no one is singled out to carry an unfair burden or be left behind.

 

That leaves me with the single insured issue. I have nothing against joining a larger consumer group if the transition is seamless and harmless. I see nothing in this bill that assures me that bringing one-lifers into a larger consumer pool will be a simple matter of paperwork. I have paid into my present medical coverage for the past 15 years with very little medical expense. At my age, I am not a very good prospect to a new insurance carrier and would be an enticing target to jettison by my insurance carrier if given half a chance. The law must ensure the pooling of one-life groups is carried out in a transparent and professional manner.

 

Yes, Governor, there are good provisions in this bill, and insurance reform is needed. But this bill is premature in its design and puts people at risk needlessly. 

 

I know you will do your best to do what is right, as you have done before. But no irreversible harm will come from putting this reform bill off another year so adequate provisions can be made to protect all the people.

 

ex animo

Stefani Stauffer, age 16 years, is a child who has been living with Gwen
and John Turner in an independent living status up until May 6th. The child
left the Turner residence and reported to the abuse registry on May 7th
that she was kicked out of the Turner home. Note: Ms Turner is employed by
Family Continuity, but is not responsible for managing Stefani's case.  As
of this writing, Stefani is with Paula Kaminski, who is a 19 year old
friend. Stefani has requested that she be assessed today to determine
whether or not she can reside with Ms Kaminski as a roomate.

This situation is currently being investigated by Deborah Hansen,
caseworker for Family Continuity Program.  In addition, a motion has been
filed today before Judge Sullivan informing the court of the recent events
and requesting an order be entered allowing the child to be "picked up".

Prior to these events, case management was being provided by Carol
Mannering, Family Continuity Program.

I will continue to work closely with the Family Continuity staff as the
case develops further.

I will provide you updates as appropriate or as you request.

Thanks.

Subject:	High School Blues in California

Jeb,

As if high school students in California do not have enough problems, a controversial new policy affecting eight California high schools asks seniors who wish to walk in graduation ceremonies to first submit a plan and documentation proving they're going to college, a trade school, or the military. 

Fox News takes up the story today here:
<http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,52875,00.html>

Reason Editor Nick Gillespie takes Los Angeles Unified's General Counsel Harold Kwalwasser to task for this adolescent injustice on CNN's American Morning with Paula Zahn. Here's a sample:  "You know, well, first off, I want to congratulate the Los Angeles unified school district on creating a new reason for kids to resent high school and administrators. If this planning was such an obvious good idea, then make it a requirement of graduation, but don't let people go through what the state approves and what L.A. approves as necessary to graduate from high school, and then deny them the right to graduate in front of their friends as parent."

And in a perfect soundbite moment Nick ends the interview with an argument for school choice:  "Jack, if I may add, the real question here really is educational choice, and is matching parents and students to school that have curricula and programs that they want, and until we address that basic issue, and this is one of the reasons why in Los Angeles, where people are very fearful of sending their kids to the schools."

SHOW: AMERICAN MORNING WITH PAULA ZAHN 07:00 

May 9, 2002 Thursday 

Transcript # 050905CN.V74 

SECTION: News; Domestic 

LENGTH: 1526 words 

HEADLINE: Some Students in San Fernando Valley Won't be Donning Caps and Gowns Because They 'Failed to Develop Acceptable Plan for Future' 

GUESTS: Nick Gillespie, Harold Kwalwasser 

BYLINE: Jack Cafferty 

HIGHLIGHT: 
This summer, some students in California's San Fernando Valley will not be donning caps and gowns with their classmates because they failed to develop an acceptable plan for their future. 

BODY: 
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. 

JACK CAFFERTY, CNN ANCHOR: This time of year, high school seniors all across the country counting the days until graduation. It's often said at the annual pomp-and-circumstance ceremony that graduation is not the end of anything, rather it's the beginning. 

This summer, some students in California's San Fernando Valley will not be donning caps and gowns with their classmates because they failed to develop an acceptable plan for their future. There is a new school policy out there that says only student who have committed to postgraduate training in college, trade school or the military, will be allowed to participate in graduation ceremonies. They'll still get the diploma, but they won't participate in the graduation ceremony. As you might imagine, there is a hew and cry coming from this idea. 

Joining us from Los Angeles to talk about it is Harold Kwalwasser, who's general counsel for the Los Angeles unified school district, and from Washington D.C., Nick Gillespie, who's editor in chief of "Reason" magazine. 

Gentlemen, welcome. It's nice to you have with us. 

Harold, let me begin with you. The minute we began teasing this story we starting getting e-mails saying something to the effect, how dare the schools demand that students lay out some sort of plan for the future in order to be allowed to participate in their graduation if they met all the requirements to, in fact, graduate from high school. It sounds a bit Draconian. Tell me how it works. 

HAROLD KWALWASSER, GENERAL COUNSEL, L.A. UNITED SCHOOL DIST.: First of all, it is a great success, and I want to emphasize that in the beginning, because what we tried to do here is encourage think about after school, and that means not just those going college, but those who are going to go on and get a job afterward. We don't want them in dead-end jobs. We don't want them really just falling off the edge of the earth. We want these children to understand there is more out there to life, and you don't have to go to college to get it. You can have a plan for life where you can find advancement through vocational education, through apprenticeships, through the military, and we want them merely e think about these things and plan for them. 

CAFFERTY: What about kids... 

KWALWASSER: Now the thing I think I must take exception to, is it's not clear to me at the end of the day we're going to have anybody that's denied the right to participate in the graduation ceremony. As of May 1st, we had approximately 95 percent of our kids in local district C, the San Fernando Valley, who have in fact completed their plans. We have an expectation that virtually everybody will have completed the plans by graduation time. 

CAFFERTY: What about a kid that doesn't know what he wants to do, or what about a kid who doesn't have the money to go to college, who says, hey, I have to work in one of those so-called dead-end jobs in a couple of years to save up some money, and then I'll decide whether I want to go to college or not? 

Are there exceptions to this rule? Can a kid still participate if he doesn't fall into one of the three defined category, college, vocational, trade school or the military? 

KWALWASSER: Oh, sure. This is not about trying to force kids not to work or to penalize kids if they do work. This is to say to kids who are going to go off to work, well, let's think about your future and how you're going to advance from the entry-level job you get when you finish high school to something better thereafter. Remember, what we're trying to do is to get kids to plan for the future. 

CAFFERTY: Fair enough. 

KWALWASSER: That's what they have to do. It's merely to participate in thinking about their future, and in raising their expectations, and in having high expectations of them. 

CAFFERTY: Nick Gillepsie, let me switch... 

KWALWASSER: So once they participate in the plan, that's sufficient. 

CAFFERTY: Let's me switch to this to Nick Gillespie. And let me put up some statistics, Nick, that appear this is more than a good idea. These are statistics from the district C that's involved in this program, enrollment at University of California schools up 10 percent overall, an 8 percent increase for white students, for Latino students up 31 percent, for African-American students up 150 percent. The numbers seem to suggest that something's working. What's your reaction? 

NICK GILLESPIE, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, "REASON: MAGAZINE: You know, well, first off, I want to congratulate the Los Angeles unified school district on creating a new reason for kids to resent high school and administrators. If this planning was such an obvious good idea, then make it a requirement of graduation, but don't let people go through what the state approves and what L.A. approves as necessary to graduate from high school, and then deny them the right to graduate in front of their friends as parent. 

"The Los Angeles Times" yesterday reporting the story made it clear many students won't be involved in graduation because of this, and also, you know, that there is a lot of resentment. Whatever the intentions of the plan, it's invidious. It creates two sets of graduates, one who gets to march in front of graduates and pick up their diploma, and the other ones that go on merely to work, which I thought was the great American value. 

I think it's intrusive. It inserts the school in a conversation that really most properly takes place between parents and children, in large degree, and I think it's largely ineffective for the reason that counsel was saying, in that anybody can do it. This a piece of paper, and I'm not sure that it's really focusing anybody's attention. 

CAFFERTY: What about those criticisms, Mr. Kwalwasser? 

KWALWASSER: I think they're wrong up and down the line. Let me start with a few key points. First of all, I don't think that there are going to very many kids not participating in high school graduation ceremonies. 

CAFFERTY: But why shouldn't they all be able to participate I guess is the question? If they completed the curriculum for 12 years in the public school system, why is it up to some bureaucrat to come along, and say your plan for the next part of the life isn't satisfactory for me, and therefore, you can't stand up in front of your family and friends and get your diploma? 

GILLESPIE: If I may say, it will force them to lie about something. Say, you're the son of an immigrant... 

KWALWASSER: I think that's all high speculation that doesn't mirror reality. 

GILLESPIE: No, no, well, wait. Let me just say, this is what you're saying, so the son of an immigrant who is going to work in his parent's business after school and not go on for education, what you're saying is, and not going out to the military or vocational training, what you're saying to that person is that we value your hard work and your effort in those kinds of stores less than if you say you're going on to the military. If you want to put people through an exercise... 

KWALWASSER: That hypothetical doesn't wash. 

CAFFERTY: All right, we'll give you the last word here, but it's got to be brief. We're going lose the satellite. Last word on this, and why those people that Nick is talking about shouldn't feel a bit disenfranchised by a regulation such as this. 

KWALWASSER: First of all, those kids will still graduate. The fact that you go on to work in your parents store isn't the issue, so long as you think about how you're going to advance yourself forward after you start working in your parent's store, you satisfied all the requirements here. All we're trying to do is work with these kids to plan their future. 

You know, so often, public schools are criticized for not caring about what happens to their kids. Here we have a commitment to care and to help them think through their future. If they work in their parents store but think about their future, they got it made, and they graduate in the ceremony along with everybody else. 

CAFFERTY: Good. 

GILLESPIE: Jack, if I may add, the real question here really is educational choice, and is matching parents and students to school that have curricula and programs that they want, and until we address that basic issue, and this is one of the reasons why in Los Angeles, where people are very fearful of sending their kids to the schools. 

CAFFERTY: All right. Gentlemen, I have got to stop it there. I appreciate your talking with us. We'll follow up on the story and keep track of parental reaction and student reaction out there. Nick Gillespie, from Washington, editor-in-chief of "Reason" magazine, thanks, Nick. Harold Kwalwasser, who's general counsel of the Los Angeles unified district, joining us from California. Thanks for being with us on AMERICAN MORNING. 

KWALWASSER: Thank you. Come see one of our graduations from district C.

Dear Governor Bush-
As I registered Republican I wanted to take the time to recommend Tim
Bailey, of Pompano Beach, for an appointment to the North Broward Hospital
District Commission.  I've known Tim for 15 years and have always admired
his tireless commitment to the community, his business, family and friends.
I believe that his high degree of integrity and professionalism would serve
to further improve the services the hospitals in my community are able to
offer.  In times such as these it is critical to have the best possible
candidates struggling with the cost and management issues facing entities
such as the North Broward Hospital District.

I hope that you will consider my recommendation.  Thank you for your
consideration.

Windell, great article, and, as always, great job.  The new mentor-protege
program is just the next step forward in a wildly successful effort.  The
Governor's vision and your hard work are two of the biggest reasons behind

Subject:	The 9/21/00 e-mail

Dear Governor, In case your computer no longer has my message of September 
21, 2000 on it, I decided to send the letter of that date that I mentioned in 
the first e-mail I sent to you, today,by retyping it. Cambridge Medical 
Centers Inc. is a typing mistake - it is Cambridge Medical Holdings Inc. Of 
course, this is the old Board, with Bill Scherer in control. Please pay 
special attention to the underlined part of paragraph 2 - it shows that Bill 
Scherer was knowingly lending money to defunct corporations (incidentally, it 
is also against the law for a body such as the District,  non-profit too, to 
lend money to a for-profit corporation, which Scherer had to know.) I am so 
disgusted that the present Board is split, with Scherer advocating keeping 
the clinic at Deerfield open, when the Board knows that it has failed so 
badly that they have had to pour about $2,000,000 into it. There is no 
reasonable rationale for doing this in the face of the residents holding a 
rally against it, except for Scherer to win Trinchi's four votes to stay on 
as attorney to the Board, for the political benefit of Trinchi, to conceal 
that the residents would be committed to paying the mortgage on the new 5000 
square foot clubhouse built to replace the one Trinchi gave to Cambridge for 
the clinic. I hope you realize that these e-mails are coming to you because 
of my interest in doing the right thing. Sincerely, Jane Kreimer 

Subj:  The Honorable Paul Sallarulo and The Honorable Emmett McTigue, etc.

Dear Governor Bush,

For me, the Cambridge mess is the last straw in a long line of last straws. 

The Board is going to tell you that they had no idea what was going on, 
especially when they voted for Cambridge Medical Center Inc. No excuse is 
acceptable. They should have done what Paul Sallarulo did at his first Board 
meeting. He refused to vote because they delivered the information he needed 
to read in order to make a decision at about 5 o'clock the day before, on 
Tuesday. Then he ordered the president and ceo to deliver whatever he needed 
to make a decision, on the Friday before the monthly Wednesday meeting, and 
said that otherwise he wasn't voting. I told the other Board members that 
there was no excuse for their not having done the same thing a long time ago.

The Board, in the person of Dr. Rosalyn Carter (Ph.D) was quoted recently in 
one of the newspapers as having said that they had no idea that Bill Scherer 
wrote a second contract for Barry Chapnick and Trinchi on April 1st or 1999, 
after the clinic failed to open at all on March 1 of 1999 under the terms of 
the first contract of October 1st, 1998. Without first going back to the 
Board for permission to write a second contract, Bill Scherer changed the 
terms, and gave Cambridge at Margate a 9 1/2% loan, which was way under what 
the Board had agreed to. I informed the Board of this at the June 1999 
meeting, the same meeting where I read all of the Cambridge corporations to 
them that I had pulled from the internet from the Division of Corporations, 
all of which read "dissolved for failure to file annual report" except one, 
which read "active". When I called to double check that one, the Department 
told me that they were "active but not current", which meant they had not 
paid their fee or filed before May 1 of that year. In August, they were 
dissolved for failure to file the annual report. Not one Board member did 
anything about it, and they let it ride for more than a year. The clinic at 
Deerfield beach, Century Village, was also failing.

The District does not have to lose that $500,000 loan (or the loss that 
followed). They don't have to file an expensive lawsuit to get that money 
back. They can go against Bill Scherer's  and Buchanan and Ingersoll's e and 
o insurance (Buchanan and Ingersoll closed the loan for Scherer), as well as 
the bond that the District paid for Trinchi when he was appointed to the 
District in the first place. I think it is fair to say that Scherer and 
Trinchi are in BIG trouble. It just doesn't pay to lie to the public and 
cheat the taxpayers. I hope you do not intend to protect Bill Scherer because 
he raised so much money for you and especially for your brother now.

Quite frankly, and sadly, I don't think that Trinchi knows what the truth is 
anymore. He said at the last Board meeting that he didn't know the law firm 
Greenberg and Traurer - had never heard of them, when Moskowitz (who 
definitely should be bounced off that Board) recommended them to write a 
letter to Bob Butterworth asking if it was legal to lend the half million in 
the first place. Truth: Trinchi was standing next to the attorneys for 
Century Village and Greenberg and Traurer at a City Commission meeting in 
Deerfield when Greenberg and Traurer were chosen to handle the current bond 
issue for Deerfield Beach - which choice never would have been made without 
Trinchi's approval.

Contrary to Trinchi's insisting that the residents at Century Village want a 
clinic, they held a huge rally against it before the clinic was put in by 
Trinchi. That is why Trinchi by-passed a vote on it, and just went ahead and 
announced that it was an accomplished fact.

As I told Arlene DiBenigno, when the District is failing financially two 
years in a row, which it is, you are supposed to take it over, and appoint a 
new Board. I would say the $12,000,000 last year and $7,000,000 this year in 
arrears, qualifies for such action. I feel very strongly that when one is 
appointed to the Board, one owes the Governor who appointed you absolute 
loyalty. This is why I have so little respect for Trinchi, Carter, Weaver and 
Moskowitz. Dead or alive, they owe Lawton Chiles that loyalty, and instead, 
in my opinion they have disgraced him, as well as themselves. In my opinion, 
Cora Braynan has done the same thing to you, by aligning herself with them 
and everything they do. Emmett McTigue stands alone from those other 
appointees as a pillar of integrity, intelligence and common sense, and 
should remain on the Board, as should Paul Sallarulo.

A fine kettle of fish! I don't know you at all. You have some tough choices 
to make. I just hope that you have the character and integrity to make the 
right ones.

Sincerely,  Jane Kreimer

Dear Jeb,

I am pursuing TNT Logistics, an $11B revenue Dutch-based firm with its North American HQ in Jacksonville. A former exec from the FEC told me they just won the BMW account which will likely result in their building a new distribution center probably in JAX. I write just in case you want to call. They are worldwide, having started in Australia. They are TNT Logistics not TNT Trucking: 904-928-1400. I don't know the CEO as I'm dealing with a VP who's a friend of the FEC guy.

If you know all this, forgive me for wasting your time.

Governor-Much to my surprise, you have a slew of qualified, talented, honest
and serious applicants for the vacancy created by Nora Williams'
resignation.  All of them could do the job, all save one would share your
beliefs.  I write to respectfully suggest your attention to one
candidate-Bert Jiminez.

Bert has been a Realtor in the Upper Keys for 25 years, well ahead of a
recent dramatic increase in the Hispanic community's size there(as opposed
to a long-standing Hispanic presence in Key West).  He is smart, honest and
capable.  He has a degree in microbiology, which would help him to base
environmental decisions on science, and budget experience, which will be the
bulk of the Commission's work during a care taking period through the
Summer.  He has been involved in the community, but not in the political
swirl, which may be a plus.  He would be the first Hispanic commissioner in
generations.  I believe that he would serve with distinction.  I believe
that Commissioner Williams shares my view, and will communicate her thoughts
to you directly.

Good luck in your difficult task.

Jeb:
 
Ironically, after sending you an update on my efforts with Stefani, I opened my e-mail and found the following about See America First.   This progam was started by Janet & Jack Mauriello of Amesbury, Massachusetts.   Janet has always been involved in exchange student programs, and from that developed a program for students to "See America First".  From the following correspondence, it seems as though they are expanding the exchange program into a more comprehensive program to assist children in other ways.
 
I have known Janet all of my life; our fathers went to first grade together.  Though we don't keep in touch all that much, we are long time friends.   She and Jack are high school sweethearts have been married about 20 yrs.  They have raised three children of their own.
 
If you think this program would be a benefit to our state, please contact Janet at the below address.  Hope this may be of some help.

Sandy, I thought of you when I read an article in the Boston Sunday Globe about the revival of civics education for school children and the benefits such as increased voter participation more community involvement.  It states that Bush's advisors are trying to come up with a plan such a federal incentives for states that adopt civics education. I thought that Gov. Bush might be interested in hearing about See America First...especially if participation could result in better citizens AND federal incentives.
 
Just to give you few updates..we will soon be a Foundation under National Heritage Foundation, we are also forming a strategic alliance with yourhomework.com.  The best part of that is we will have a full page on their website devoted to our Fostering Awareness program.  We have endorsement letters from the State of Massachusetts and would love to replicate this program for the benefit of kids in foster care in Florida.  Our first Fostering Awareness program is scheduled for July and then is expected to run on a monthly basis.
 
Jack has taken on a project that is close to my heart and I had to put on the back burner due to "not enough hours in the day"...This other program we are developing is for kids that are "aged out" of foster care and have been accepted to community college...but can't attend because they have no housing and no family!  Can you imagine...these kids are supported through their teen years and then they just fall off when they are 18 because their is no affordable housing?  So Jack is looking into a program where we will buy multiple family dwellings in communities surrounding community colleges and offer housing to these kids.  The State Outreach Workers supervise the kids and the State pays for their living expenses.  The kids are incentivized to do well and stay in school because they have about 200 applicants waiting for their spot.   It is a great investment in these kids....
 
Ok...didn't mean to get into all of that...Bottom line is we would love contact with anyone in the Bush Administration that could assist us in becoming part of the plan for civics education.. I would love for Gov. Bush Bush to also be aware of what we are planning to accomplish with See America First and Fostering Awareness.  The website has been updated and gives a bit better picture of what we are doing...
 
Talk to you soon!

This email is from Mike Watkins at the request of Laura Branker.

* Stefani continues to be under the case management of Family Continuity
Program.

* Stefani's placement with Paula Kaminski (19 year old friend) was approved
on May 9th by Family Continuity.

* On Tuesday night May 14th, Family Continuity filed a motion to "pick-up"
Stefani due to her threats of running away.  Stefani made these threats
after being presented with a plan to place her into a residential group
care setting (SB1214) in order for her to be successfully transitioned into
independent living.

* On May 15th, Stefani requested and was granted a hearing before Judge
Sullivan to be declared an adult.  Judge Sullivan deferred his ruling on
Stefani's request and  scheduled a hearing for June 12, 2002.   He also
approved continued placement with Paula Kaminski and ordered Stefani to
complete her last 3 weeks of school at Tarpon Springs High School where she
is currently a junior.  The judge agreed that a residential group care
placement should be pursued for Stefani as long as she remains at Tarpon
Springs High School.

* The school reports that Stefani is "progressing and is on target".

* Stefani will be 17 years old next month.

Hi Governor Bush,
My name is Pete Bohatch and I am an assistant principal at Charlotte High
School in Punta Gorda. Our high school is currently celebrating it's 75th
Anniversary. In addition, our principal, Mr. Barney Duffy was just
selected Principal of the Year for the state of Florida by the National
Association of Secondary Schools Principals. Mr. Duffy has restored pride
and tradition to our school through his hands on approach to leadership.
Student involvement in extracurricular activities and community service
have soared to record levels under Mr. Duffy's leadership. I know that you
are extremely busy, but was wondering if you would be willing to stop by
our school, if you are in the area, to help us celebrate 75 years of
service to the Charlotte County community, and recognize Florida's
Principal of the Year. We have a couple of year end events coming up, such
as our end of the year luncheon for teachers, scheduled for May 29th.
Please keep us in mind if you are in the area. We appreciate all that you
do for the "kids" in Charlotte County.

Sincerely,
Pete Bohatch

Great people who will clean up the mess.
 
Second, thousands of us are buying the photo montage in part because of the flap.

Maybe a very public announcement that 1/3 of all of the proceeds (the 1/3 represented by the photo) will be donated.
 
Several birds will be gotten with one stone:  Greater sales; lots of publicity; and money for the victims.

Hey Jeb, don't you think kids should get an education and not be used as
some political prop?  Your campaign appearance at a school the other day was
deplorable considering that under your watch Florida has dropped
significantly in every performance benchmark that matters.  If Florida
Schools are such a wonderful place to get an education, how come YOUR kids
aren't in public schools?

I wouldn't trust a man who's never driven a car to teach me to drive.
Likewise, how can this state expect a man who has only campaigned in public

Oh, and by the way, it's MY Florida too.  Stop treating OUR state like it's

Subject: GOVERNOR BUSH'S SIGNING OF CS/SB 520


MEMORANDUM


 

 

FROM:    THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR

 


DATE:     WEDNESDAY, MAY 15, 2002


 

RE:          GOVERNOR BUSH'S SIGNING OF CS/SB 520

 

Florida's driver licenses and identification cards will be more secure because of a bill that Gov. Jeb Bush signed into law today.  The bill (CS/SB 520) establishes penalties for knowingly selling, manufacturing, or delivering - or offering to sell, manufacture or deliver - any "blank, forged, stolen, fictitious, counterfeit, or unlawfully issued" driver license or identification card.

 

The bill also codifies changes made in response to Executive Order 2001-300, which Governor Bush signed on October 11, 2001 in response to the September 11th terrorist attacks.  These changes include a provision that the Florida driver licenses and identification cards of non-U.S. citizens whose stay in Florida is temporary will generally expire when their U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service documents expire.

 

The new law does not affect the 1999 statute requiring all applicants for a Florida driver license or identification card to provide documentary proof of their legal presence in the United States when such proof has not been previously established.

 

However, the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, in concert with the Governor, has initiated an outreach program to address the concerns of non-U.S. citizens.  Informative brochures in English, Spanish, and Haitian Creole have been prepared. They offer details concerning the documents required to obtain a license or ID card.  Acceptable documents include those indicating that license applicants have submitted information to the INS and are awaiting a determination of their status.  Such applicants may be entitled to a two-year license.  

 

 The department also has hired a Miami-based liaison to Florida's Hispanic community. One of his goals is to dispel misunderstandings.  For instance, driver license examiners do not seize and keep valid immigration documents, nor do they summon the INS for the purpose of arresting non-U.S. citizens. Rather, the examiners briefly take custody of the documents for the purpose of making copies, after which the documents are returned.

 

Governor Bush's statement on the signing of CS/SB 520 is attached for your information.

 

Thank you.

 

May 15, 2002

 

 

The Honorable Katherine Harris

Secretary of State

PL 02, The Capitol

Tallahassee, Florida 32399

 

Dear Secretary Harris:

 

I hereby transmit to you, with my signature, Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 520, setting forth requirements to obtain a Florida driver's license or identification card and prohibiting the manufacturing or sale of fake or stolen driver's licenses or identification cards.

 

Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 520 continues important efforts to clearly identify the documents individuals can use to obtain a driver's license or identification card and the length of time the license will be valid.  This legislation, in fact, adds to the existing list of acceptable documents in an effort to protect those individuals that have come to Florida for legitimate purposes.

 

This legislation also contains provisions which will close a loophole in current law and make it illegal for anyone to knowingly manufacture, sell or deliver a fake or stolen driver's license or identification card, another important step toward ensuring the citizens of this state and nation are protected.

 

A driver's license is much more than merely a means to individual travel.  Driver's licenses are accepted across the United States as a primary form of identification and a passport to many of the things that make up our modern lifestyle - major purchases, automobile rentals and apartment rentals.

 

The tragic events of September 11, 2001, and the ensuing investigations into the backgrounds of the individuals involved in the terrorist attacks underscored the need to continually review and adapt Florida laws concerning the type of documents used to obtain a driver's license or identification card and the length of time a license should be made available to certain non-citizens of Florida. 

 

Immediately after the September 11 attacks, I appointed a taskforce to review security issues in this state.  The Taskforce on Domestic Security, led by Commissioner Tim Moore, Director of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE), made the following recommendations concerning Florida's licenses and identification cards:

 

*	Implement measures to eliminate the inadvertent issuance of fraudulent driver's licenses.  


*	Enhance the driver's license issuance process to ensure reliability and validation of identity. 


*	Acquire equipment for driver's license issuance to create a record of companion documents used to establish identity.  


*	Provide a high level of identity security and enhance the forensics aspects of investigative activities through use of layered biometrics technology, such as facial recognition, fingerprint and iris scanning. 

Unfortunately, some misunderstandings have arisen concerning the impact this legislation will have on Florida's immigrant community.  Some say this bill ties legal presence to licensure eligibility for the first time.  This is not true.  For several years now, Florida law has required legal presence in the United States.  Since 1999, Florida law has named the specific documents that must be presented when applying for a driver's license or identification card for the first time -- a certified copy of a United States birth certificate, a valid United States passport, an alien registration receipt card (green card), an employment authorization card issued by the United States Department of Justice, or proof of nonimmigrant classification provided by the United States Department of Justice.  Additional requirements went into effect in December 2001, to implement the recommendations of the Taskforce on Domestic Security.  These requirements limited the time a driver's license is valid to coincide with the expiration of INS documentation.

 

I believe this bill establishes reasonable and necessary requirements for issuing licenses and identification cards in this state.  I am committed to ensuring that those in Florida's immigrant community are fully informed about the new requirements so that this law does not place an undue hardship on individuals seeking proper identification.  The Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles has conducted a number of document verification seminars and trained 480 managers and driver's license examiners to be able to carry out the new requirements in a courteous, respectful and professional manner.  To strengthen our ongoing outreach efforts, the department has employed a coordinator who will serve as the state's Hispanic and immigrant community liaison on this issue.  

 

Florida has a rich and diverse culture.  It is a strength more critical to our common future than even our healthy climate and world-famous beaches.  People of all nationalities come to Florida for the beauty, but they stay because of the richness of our culture and the opportunity Floridians share to build a future together.  As you know, my family reflects the ethnic diversity we all cherish, so I understand the great sensitivity that many Floridians share about issues relating to documentation.

 

The strong justifications for this bill notwithstanding, I am aware of the possibility that this bill may have unintended consequences for individuals who have had licenses for many years but may be unable to renew them under this law.  I encourage the Legislature and the department to monitor this new law and consider the possibility of follow-up legislation next session.  Although Senate Bill 520 allows the granting of license privileges to individuals who have residency applications pending before the INS, further legislation may be needed to resolve unintended problems arising from this bill.  

 

Although I am sensitive to the concerns raised about this legislation, I fully believe these measures are appropriate and necessary.  I am confident that the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles will make it a priority to work with Florida's communities on the new requirements contained in this legislation.  

 

For the reasons set forth above, I hereby sign Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 520.

 

                        Sincerely,

                        Jeb Bush

LEGISLATURE: Well done





Monday, the Florida Legislature wrapped up its work for the year. It was an 
impressive showing.

Lawmakers had their work cut out for them. A mild recession had caused a 
budget setback earlier. The realignment of legislative and congressional 
seats that is required every 10 years was due.

Even though Republicans control both houses, Senate President John McKay set 
off on his own course this year, determined to totally revamp the state's tax 
structure and build in huge revenue increases for the future. When his plan 
did not fly, McKay impeded other legislation until he got a sop for his 
wounded feelings. It took leadership by Gov. Jeb Bush, incoming Senate 
President Jim King and House Speaker Tom Feeney to restore order, although 
McKay got in the last shot by killing the tax holiday for shoppers next year.

Still, the Legislature managed to do redistricting in record time, with 
fairly drawn boundaries for the most part.

It also was able to enact a $50.4 billion budget for the coming year that 
included $262 million in temporary tax relief for business to help stimulate 
the state's economic activity.

Since 1998, Bush and the Legislature have enacted $6 billion in tax relief, 
rolling back the tax increases of the previous eight years. Taxes have been 
reduced as a percent of personal income from 6.4 percent in 1998-99 to less 
than 6 percent in 2002-03.

One of the major accomplishments was a human resources outsourcing proposal 
that will produce an estimated $173 million savings by providing private 
sector contracts for personnel services. 

Providing prescription drug coverage for Medicaid-eligible elderly residents 
of the state, funding for the governor's statewide reading initiative and 
legislation to preserve the state's environment by providing guidelines for 
managing growth were among other accomplish- ments.

In addition, the Legislature finished restructuring the Cabinet, revamped the 
entire education code and increased school funding by 6 percent.

Even chronic complainers will have difficulty faulting the Legislature for 
its work this year under difficult conditions.

Dear Governor Bush
 
I am president and CEO of the largest privately held Biotech Company in San Diego, California, Scantibodies Clinical Laboratory.  We have 385 employees and manufacture First Response, the nation's leading over the counter pregnancy test.  We have also discovered a new hormone which is the inhibitor of PTH.  PTH is a critical measurement for the lives of renal dialysis patients.
 
We perform routine dialysis blood testing in Florida and we are licensed to do this testing for dialysis patients in Florida.  We are the only lab that offers the testing of both PTH and its inhibitor.  This testing of dialysis patients helps them to avoid being unnecessarily treated with vitamin D.  This treatment not only doubles the cost to Florida Medicaid unnecessarily, but more importantly, leads Florida dialysis patients to develop the key life threatening disease that cripples their lives, soft tissue calcification.
 
Our Florida sales force has been blocked continually from being able to offer these tests in Florida by the large dialysis chains of Fresenius, Gambro and Davita.  Medical Directors at these dialysis units have been threatened with a decrease in finances paid to them if they allow blood samples (which have been requested by nephrologists treating Florida dialysis patients) to be sent to labs other than Fresenius, Gambro and Davita.  I would like to share more details with you if you would find it useful.
 
For the sake of the Florida dialysis patients and the nephrologists in Florida I urge you to break the power of self serving dialysis chains by passing the bill that would bar them from controlling the stream of blood samples to their own labs by voting to pass the bill approved by the Senate and House of Representatives.
 
Thank you,

Dear Gov. Bush,
 
In case Katherine failed to forward Butch Cronon's response to Dr. Rodger's letter to you, I am sending it.  As chair of the rules committee, I would like confirmation that we are indeed proceeding in the direction of the statue.  Judge Carney appeared before the Partnership Board recently and carefully explained that to continue to draw down federal funds, we should be very careful to prioritize working families.  
 
In the proposed rule, we have defined "Working Family" as :
20 (a)  A single parent family in which the parent with whom the child resides is employed a minimum of 20 hours per week.
 
(b)  A two parent family in which both parents with whom the child resides ar employed a minimum of 20 hours per week.
 
(c)  A family with whom the child resides and in which parental work requirements are not met due to disability, as determined and documented by a physician licensed under Chapters 458 or 459, Florida Statues.  Eligible educational activities, as defined herein, may be substituted for required hours of employment on an hourly basis.
 
Under "Eligibility", we have stated:
xxA-1.004  Eligibility for children in working families whose income does not exceed 150 percent of the federal poverty level.
    Within the eligibility category established by S. 411.01(6)(a)(3);Florida Statues,
 
        (1)  "Working families," as defined by rule will be given priority for children in this eligibility category.  
 
        (2)  Coalitions may use "other funds," as defined by rule, whose children are determined to be at hgih risk of school failure, to the greatest extent possible.  Eligivility under this provision does not eliminate the requirement that family income not exceed 150 percent of the federal poverty level.
 
The word "priority" is the key word here.  Nothing prohibits them from serving other children once they have served single parent families with one parent working, two parent homes where both are working, and families who are disabled.
 
Because I was present at the conference that Dr. Nanette Rodgers presided over this spring, I humbly suggest you may want to send her a reply instead of the Partnership Board.  I guess it is in keeping with the principle of "doing good to those who wrongfully hurt you" that prompts me to suggest this.  Dr. Rodgers perpetuated your letter of regrets (of your inavailability to attend her conference) to be read with slur and sarcasim, to which an audience of about 500 booed you.  I know you would like to see her turn her opinion around, if at all possible. 
 
This may give you an opportunity to open the door of caring about her needs, by explaining the above statues and principles upon which we are trying to write rule.  In the meantime, if we have misinterpreted, please let us know.  Our next rules meeting is Monday, May 20.  I have a lot of work to do in very litte time if we are not proceeding down the right path.  Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.  
 
Sincerely,
Ellen McKinley

Subject: RE: School Readiness

Katherine, I would hope you, as Executive Director ,will respond to the E-mail from Dr. Rodgers outlining the statutorily mandated parameters in s.411.01. The Legislature in the "Intent" section defines the precepts for readiness, s.411.01(2)a..." It is the intent of the Legislature that such programs be developmentally appropriate,research-based, Involve parents as their child's first teacher, serve as a preventive measure for children at risk of school failure"....
 
s.411.01(2)b...."It is the intent of the Legislature that school readiness programs be operated on a full-day, year round basis to the maximum extent possible to enable parents to work and become financially self sufficient.
 
 
s.411.01(2)f...."It is the intent of the Legislature that the school readiness program coordinate and operate in conjunction with the district school systems. However,It is also the intent of the Legislature the school readiness not be construed as part of the free public schools but rather as a separate program for children under the age of Kindergarten".....
 
 
s.411.01(3)b...."Nothing contained in this act is intended: 1.Relieve parents and guardians of their own obligations to ready their children for school; or".....
 
Dr.Rodgers points out the commendable efforts the Polk county school district has expended in preparing children for school and hopefully the district will continue to be part of the readiness equation. However, when we have such limited resources, why would we want to usurp the parental responsibility of stay at home parents to prepare children for school. Many families can not take jobs, so they can become self sufficient, because of limited resources, their children are on waiting lists Dr, Rodgers seems to suggest we just let those families stay on waiting list and allow the school district to maintain the status quo with school readiness and let stay at home parents enroll their children in school based programs. Readiness has two main purposes, First to help parents prepare their children for school and secondly, to help families become self sufficient. As an aside you might recall the Board discussion regarding this issue and the comments by both Senator Jennings an Deputy Director Hattie pointing out the need to focus on working families and self sufficiency when our resources are limited
 
Dr. Rodgers may wish to work with the readiness coalition in developing a out reach effort to help assist stay at home parents in readiness activities. $500,000 could fund many excellent developmentally appropriate teaching aids along with in home visits to assist stay at home parents.
 Dr. Rodgers suggestion that we have a transition year is surprising since we have had two transition years already. Perhaps a more intensified effort to work collective with the local coalition would ease this change for those who want to maintain the status quo.  
Thank you, Butch

Subject: School Readiness

Dear Governor Bush,

 

 The  Reading First Initiative will be discussed at the Polk County  School Readiness Enhancements Committee meeting on May 14th. We are involved in a HUBS Project with the University of South Florida to empower parents to be their child's first teacher. 

 

I am concerned with Chapter  411 and the writing of the Rules that determine "eligibility for school readiness" programs. Please note in 411:   (6) Eligible children before kindergarten 3 (a) economically disadvantaged. It does not mention that two parents have to be working.  As I understand it, the definition of "economically disadvantaged" does not indicate that both parents have to be working. 

 

Moving from DOE PreK programs to Workforce Innovation and  combining subsidized child care with PreK, we may not be allowed to serve children we now serve in the  Polk County School System school readiness program because both parents have to work and be at least 150% of the poverty level.  

 

 I think we should continue to require that at least one parent work and not require that both parents work as long as they are economically disadvantaged, meet the 150% requirement and pay a sliding scale parent fee. We have collected over $500,000 to reinvest in the program with quality enhancements for the children. Holiday care and summer school care are two of the enhancements.

 

 

 If we do move in this direction, requiring that both parents work, we should be given time to implement the new initiative. If we change the now existing rule, 64% of our 1100 eligible children  in Polk County Schools'  school readiness programs will not meet the new eligibility requirements. We have had different PreK Early Intervention rules with DOE through the years. 

 

I believe we will have a large number of now eligible children in the state that will not be served and will not be ready for school. Could we initiate a PreK School Readiness Category in this transition year and evaluate this designation throughout  the 2002-2003 school year? 

 

Secretary Jim Horne stated in a directive recently to all school superintendents that he wants public schools to stay involved in the universality of all early education and care in Florida.  Please help us serve "economically disadvantaged' children regardless of  whether one or two parents are working.

 

 You are invited to visit our PreK programs in Polk County. We are pleased with our curriculum and other aspects of our program. Please check out our website: www.pcsb.k12.fl.us/prek and click on the "light bulb" icon. Is Your Child Ready For School "puppy dog" icon has received many hits around the nation. Please let us know what you think about the curriculum. We have correlated it to the  Sunshine State Standards, Core Knowledge and Polk County Standards.

 

 

Polk County Schools implement  57 public school PreK Early Intervention,Migrant PreK sites and 17 contracted child care center sites. We are planning to add 10 additional public school classes next year at the request of Superintendent Jim Thornhill and the School Board, if we can work out the "working parent" situation. We believe in partnering with our local child care providers. They contract with us for the 10 hour day and extended day and year care. 

 

We were pleased that you read at Family Fundamentals in Lakeland recently. We appreciate your efforts on behalf of all Florida's youngest citizens and their families.

 

Cordially, 

Nanette N. Rodgers Ed.D

Governor Bush, 

Please support continuation funding for Florida's citizen review panels, as outlined in 39.702 FS.  These programs utilize trained, community volunteers to review the cases of abused and neglected children under court supervision.  Not only does this increase the amount of time the circuit court has to address other issues before the court, citizen review engages the community to find local solutions to crisis situations within their own community.  Additional federal dollars can be leveraged by using citizen review panels.  Utilization of circuit judges and/or general masters cannot be used for the state to remain eligible for the additional federal dollars.   

With the recent tragic events of Rilya and so many other innocent children, Florida must do all it can to help prevent additional sadness.  Take a stand to do that and preserve continuation funding for citizen review programs. 

Sincerely, 
Marcie Bailey

Jeb,
I know you do read my emails, I have tried not to be a pest this year. I am VERY concerned about Joey's situation for all children in Florida with special needs. Do you know that in deed his IEP states he will graduate May 2002 and his grades are scored in the A/B range? More frightening is- did you know he can only write his name? He can trace his address and phone number if you do the dashes or dot to dot. He can not read. This frightens me terribly as a parent of special needs children. I know we are fighting for inclusion education while our children are young and Kaitlyn being 7 with Downs is reading this year. She can write her name and by 18 will write a whole lot more. Please see this is not a school that educated or will educate a boy if he stays another year. This dear child fell through the cracks a long time ago. We need to use this time to educate the public that "now" children with Down Syndrome are being educated and yes they deserve to graduate. However we agree the diploma is not the same, their continued education won't be the same either but I do want my children to have the availability for continued education. 
I was thrilled when I heard other classmates stood up for Joey, I expect that for my children if ever a situation arises. I want to believe that in 2002 and beyond the fear of being friends with a child with a disability is gone. We have come a long way in America with women, the minority and now the disabled, please Jeb, step in with this school and help them undeerstand that pride can not blind them to the right decision, it is doing more damange for all Florida, than good. Educate everyone in the school about disabilities and inclusion- it is not a classroom, like many of the schools are treating it--it is the thoughts/concept and way we live our lives. We need to include all children right now regardless if everyone failed them, today is the time for change. Joey made it with what was presented to him. Yes, we wish it were more but it wasn't. If he were to stay until he was 22 would it help? probably not, children with Down Syndrome learn best 0-10years proven in Jacksonville at Hope Haven. This needs to be the beginning of the Public schools admitting they failed too. Lets make the changes and forget our pride, it is for the FUTURE of all children in the school system with disabilities not "Joey."
My heart goes out to you right now with everything you are dealing with, I am praying for our children in Florida and all those involved. 
Sincerely,
Mary Pringle

I do still think that due to these arrests and other school actions that

Greetings Gov. Bush. I see from your agenda that you're out of here for a few days. I was wondering if you might be able to respond from the road. 
 
 TIME is putting a piece together for this week on the recent revelations that FBI, CIA and others had some indication something big was in the works pre 9-11. Part of that is  that your brother, the president, was briefed about this early on. Do you think it wise that he kept that quiet for so long? Did he or any of his staff pass any of that info on to you?
 
    Also, is there any sense from you  that had these tips been handled differently, Florida officials could have reacted more quickly to flight school students and  been aware of possible false IDs. Or do you think like many that indications were so vague that nothing would have changed.
 
Thanks much.   Regards,     Michael Peltier/TIME

FYI. The Children's Medical Assessment Interdisciplinary Team (CMAT)met
today. In attendance was the Client Cynthia Szuka, and both parents.  The
team did not agree on the need for some parts of the chair i.e. the Stander
and automated seat. A letter from Dr. Baynham presented to the team stated
the following:

"PATIENTS WHEELCHAIR WILL NOT NEED THE "STANDING" CAPACITY NOR AUTOMATED
SEAT THAT RAISES PATIENT.  THIS PATIENT ALREADY HAS A STANDER & DUPLICATION
OF THIS IS NOT MEDICALLY NECESSARY AND PATIENT SHOULD ATTEMPT TO PULL TO
STANDING ON HER TO INCREASE STRENGTH OF ALL MUSCLE GROUPS."

The CMAT team discovered in the home visit that DD Program had previously
paid more than $4,000.00 for a stander for this patient.  Mrs. Szuka said
she would be glad to give the stander away now to a well deserving disabled
child.

The team recommended that since Cynthia is in the CMS Network, CMS approved
Vendors and Therapist should be used.  The current recommendation is that
the child be evaluated in the CMS Wheelchair clinic by the Physiatrist, the
Orthopedist with an accompanying Therapist for a team evaluation on the most
appropriate chair for Cynthia.  This will be done at the next Wheelchair
Clinic. The Mother seems satisfied and plans to cooperate. 

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns.

FYI. A new custom wheelchair for Cynthia has essentially been approved
by
Medicaid. The only item in question is the Power Recline Stander feature
which costs $11,007.00. (Total cost of the wheelchair with this item is
$27,000. We offered to pay for the custom wheelchair without the stander
until the stander issue is resolved, but the mother did not agree. The
hesitation seems to be on the part of the therapist who we rely on to
determine medical necessity. We need to know that Cynthia will be able
to
accommodate to this new feature and /or can use it appropriately. We
also
want to make sure that it would not cause more harm than benefit (i.e.
make
sure the chair is not too heavy for her to operate safely (with her
impaired
vision), or too heavy to get onto the porch of the house etc.)We will
continue to work closely with Cynthia and her family to make sure she
receives the most appropriate wheelchair in a timely fashion.

Subject:	 Welfare Reauthorization Bill Passed in House
Attachments:	s2524.pdf

Importance:	High

This afternoon the House of Representatives passed Welfare Reauthorization (TANF), HR 4737, by a vote of 229-197, primarily along party lines.  In a related vote, the House rejected the substitute amendment offered by Rep. Cardin (D-MD).
We will send down the final version of the bill, along with a brief summary tomorrow to appropriate personnel. 
 
In the Senate, we understand that the Finance Committee will not begin consideration of a bill next week.  A committee bill has not been drafted, and mark-up of a bill in the Senate is not expected to begin until after the Memorial Day Recess. 
 
All this says-----we have some time to work go to work on concerns…Nina

May 16, 2002

THE TRANSPORTATION DISADVANTAGED MATTER
     The Florida Coalition for Disability Rights (FCDR) whose mission is to advance the human and civil rights of people with disabilities to ensure full and equal participation in all aspects of community life and the political process, is taking a stand in support of Transportation Disadvantaged (TD) legislation. It is a fully cross disability and statewide coalition that works to bring about clarity of purpose, understanding of disability issues and the collective facilitation of solutions. 
     The Pending legislation, which is now awaiting Governor Bush's signature, would take action to provide an annual place in the state's budget for funding the TD program. This has long been a goal of the combined TD constituent communities. 
     A more controversial part of the legislation would permanently remove Orlando's tri-county Transportation Authority's status as the Community Transportation Coordinator (CTC). Known as Links, the Authority has held the position as the CTC for many years. 
     During its tenure it has been subjected to much criticism and accusations. Until about a year ago most of these criticisms went unremedied. The locally owned and operated transportation providers working under contract to Links responded to some of the criticism aimed at them with calls for adequate funding so the kind of service being requested could be afforded by the providers. These requests were repeatedly denied while the complaints continued to build. 
     After a study of the situation, local political will seemed to fall in behind the idea that a proper job needed to be done for the TD and Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) paratransit services. Links finally would move in the right direction if they had the time. Putting out a request for participation, Links shocked many when it selected a single out of state company as the new transportation provider at a rate that amounts to a 76% increase.  This rate was similar to what was requested by the local providers over many years. To add insult to injury the choice of this single out of state company immediately began to put local providers out of business. By this time the complaints had built to a political crescendo and gained the attention of Speaker Tom Feeny and others in the legislature. Links intended changes were viewed by many as too little too late. 
     Seeing the opportunity to remedy the problem of complaints about Links and provide an annual commitment for funding the TD program through Senate Bill 100, members of the Florida legislature amended the bill to accomplish this. FCDR's executive committee is certainly sensitive to the concerns of the local community and the feelings expressed by some who feel that their right to choose has been preempted. However, when considering the issue on a statewide prospective it came to the conclusion that the legislation accomplishes several things. 
     First, it clearly sends the message to all transportation authorities in the state that if they fail to listen to the complaints of the TD and ADA communities they too may face a day of reckoning with Florida Lawmakers. Lawmakers who have proven their willingness to act to protect the rights of these populations. FCDR endorses this message and wishes to bring it strongly to the attention of systems in the state, which have troubled historical records where their relationships with these communities are concerned. The executive committee recommends that each transportation authority, CTC, and provider of services under TD and ADA programs carefully examine their relationship with their constituent communities and take actions to rectify any issues before similar legislative remedies are sought where they are concerned. 
     The second accomplishment embodied in the legislation will give the TD community comfort in knowing that each year the budget will include funding for the program. However, the FCDR executive committee is deeply concerned that the legislation does not specify the amount of this required funding. 
     Perhaps even more troubling is the dramatic rise in rates approved by Links. Such a 76% increase would not only wipe out any effective expansion of funding but could possibly increase the number of denied trips a year instead of providing more trips. This prospect is deeply troubling to FCDR's members and for this reason the Board will take up the question of the condition of the state of TD and ADA transportation programs in Florida at its next full meeting. There are many issues statewide not the least of which is that there is little rhyme or reason to the pricing of trips, no uniform standards, and little teeth in the current law to force change at the local level.  In the case of Links local government seems to be responding to a problem by throwing money at it without due consideration of the consequences. FCDR is not arguing against increased rates but is concerned that such a dramatic increase is either an overreaction to the troubles of a failed system or that the system statewide is so drastically under-funded that a review is not only necessary but vital to the welfare of Floridians who use these programs. To answer these questions, The FCDR Board will consider adopting a plan to inquire into the state of the TD and ADA transit systems in Florida. “The transportation problems faced by the disabled community in Florida are so concerning that it may be the next area the Board wishes to concentrate on," stated Douglas Towne, FCDR's Vice President. The last such decision to inquire, brought about landmark voting reform legislation passed this session. 
     FCDR's Executive Committee wishes to recommend to the Governor that he sign Senate Bill 100 into law and with apologies to the local community recommends that advocates work to ensure that the new CTC remain sensitive to the communities needs and complaints. It commends local advocates for speaking out, and local transportation providers for raising their concerns about the dramatic increases in cost. Furthermore it thanks Florida's legislature for acting to remedy the problem and send the message to others in the state that the concerns and complaints of Floridians who use and have a right to these programs had better not be ignored. FCDR's President, Chris Wagner, stated "The Board is committed to assure that the disabled community has full access, especially  transportation and we must make sure there is some compromise between our community and the Legislature to provide that full access."

Dear Jeb, 
Congratulations on good sessionS! Know you must be very relieved to have
the legislature shut down until after the election.
The House and Senate both passed resolutions for the hero monuments.
Please, please do a letter of endorsement or proclamation for them. You
can use the resolutions or I will be happy to send a sample to you.
Shelby Dew is out in the streets every day talking to retired and active
duty military and she has not told them that you have not endorsed the
project. But, there will be a time when it is very obvious that you are
not on board. 
I am asking you to do this not just because it is a good project but
also as a pol who knows it will be of great political value in this
military rich area.
Thanks for your consideration.

Mr. Fischer's first e-mail was acted upon by DBPR.  This is what they did:
"Dear Mr. Fischer:

Thank you again for your comments about the DBPR Online Services website. In your last email you indicated that you had problems locating some licensee's information, including yourself. I am happy to report that we have taken these comments and acted on them. Beginning the first part of June we are launching a new public search page that will provide the following new features: (1) The ability to search by just an individual's last name and board, (2) the ability to perform a "similar name" search that will allow you to search on a last name like Robert and get Robert, Robertsons, Roberts, etc. and (3) the ability to search by a board such as Real Estate or Appraisers.  Your other point about the ability to search by county has not been forgotten. We are currently gathering additional requirements for our next release, which we will be launching in late summer. The ability to search by county will be included in this change.  We appreciate your continued patience as the Department continues down the path of improved customer service. Your feedback is invaluable to making the DBPR Online Services website a success and we hope that you feel that we have taken your comments to heart and responded with something to better met your needs."

DBPR is taking a look at the new issue raised in the second e-mail below (searching by name instead of by number).  I will make sure that if it can be done, it will be done.  DBPR is being responsive, but I'm not sure Mr. Fischer will be completely satisfied unless we revert to the old-fashioned system he's used to.

Katie Muniz, communications director for Governor Bush wanted me to share
the below interesting article to provide context for the budget difficulties
confronting other states.  Because the Governor and Legislature addressed
any potential negative impact to our state's budget early, we avoided what
other states are now facing.  As a result, we were able to increase
education funding by $1.1 billion, double the funding for child welfare
services, fund a prescription drug program for low-income seniors and
continue support for restoration of the Everglades.

States' Vast Budget Gaps Bring Higher Fees and Emergency Cuts
By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM
INDIANAPOLIS, May 15 - Faced with a large, unexpected drop in income-tax
revenue, states across the country are trying desperately to plug wide
budget gaps in ways voters can abide in an election year.
Some are raising cigarette taxes and various fees. Some are cutting spending
on the edges or using bookkeeping devices to make the deficits go away. A
few have taken drastic measures to avoid raising sales or income taxes or
cutting popular programs like education.
Missouri, for example, is so short of cash that it has stopped sending out
income-tax refunds. More than 400,000 taxpayers who filed returns on their
2001 income are owed nearly $170 million. Officials promise that the refunds
will be mailed when the state's cash flow improves.
Wisconsin is considering issuing bonds secured by the 30 years of annual
payments from the national settlement with tobacco companies. The effect
would be to spend all 30 years of the state's share of the tobacco money
this year and next.
The National Conference of State Legislatures reported last month that at
least 40 states and the District of Columbia were being forced this year to
make emergency cuts in their budgets totaling $27 billion. 
Like other states, New York has had a serious shortfall in revenue - $1.2
billion less in April tax receipts than had been expected - largely because
weakness in the stock market has resulted in smaller receipts from the
capital gains tax. 
But New York is in better shape than most others because during the fat
years, Gov. George E. Pataki squirreled away as much as $4 billion. He can
now draw on that as he begins his race for re-election. In his latest
budget, he sought increased spending on popular programs and avoided
proposing a repeal of tax cuts set to take effect this year.
Still, the final budget on which New York legislative leaders wrapped up
negotiations today does include increased fees or new surcharges on a
variety of products and state services, and an expansion of the state
cigarette tax to include cigars and chewing tobacco.
Circumstances here in Indiana are more severe, and more typical. Just three
years ago, the state was sitting on a $2 billion surplus, about 10 percent
of the whole state budget. Feeling flush, Gov. Frank L. O'Bannon and the
legislature approved deep tax cuts and undertook an ambitious plan to raise
school standards.
But times changed almost overnight. Indiana's deficit is now more than $1
billion, and the figure seems to grow with each recalculation. So this week,
irritable at having to leave their jobs and families, and pessimistic about
being able to resolve the crisis, legislators began meeting here in a rare
special session.
Nowhere is the situation more dire than in California. On Tuesday, Gov. Gray
Davis proposed closing a shortfall of $23.6 billion, one-third of the entire
budget, by raising vehicle license fees and cigarette taxes and making steep
reductions in health programs and aid to local governments.
The details of the problem and the solutions that officeholders are
considering vary by state, but the basics are the same.
In the prosperity of the late 1990's, the states acted as if good times
would always roll, slashing taxes for individuals and businesses and
spending with abandon.
When the economy turned sour, revenue fell sharply, higher spending was
locked into place, and the states, most of them required by their
constitutions to run balanced budgets, found themselves in deep holes.
The problem is complicated by the elections this fall. Budget-cutting
invariably requires bitter medicine, and few politicians are willing to risk
re-election to administer it.
"In an election year," said Governor O'Bannon, who called the special
session here, "you always get political policy mixed up with public policy."
New Jersey has one of the worst deficits of any state in percentage terms,
12 percent of the total budget, according to calculations by the conference
of state legislatures. But New Jersey holds its elections for state offices
in odd-numbered years, and that has eased the pressure on the new governor,
James E. McGreevey. He is reducing the budgets of state agencies by 5
percent and cutting back on construction and maintenance projects.
Connecticut has managed to control its deficit with a 61-cent-a-pack
increase in cigarette taxes, to $1.11 from 50 cents.
North Carolina raised income and sales taxes last year, but it is an
exception. Few states are using general tax increases to try to recoup the
$35 billion in tax cuts that were enacted in the eight years ended in 2000.
Spending reductions have been imposed almost everywhere. The conference of
state legislatures reported that 17 states had cut aid to elementary and
secondary education, or might do so. That aid is a big part of the budget in
all states but usually one of the last places politicians look to save
money.
Twenty-nine states are considering cuts in higher education, 25 in prisons
and 22 in Medicaid, the conference found. At least 10 may lay off state
employees.
But to a large extent, said Don Boyd, director of the Fiscal Studies Program
at the Rockefeller Institute in Albany, states are resorting to gimmicks and
procrastination, trying to sweep as much dust as possible under the rug and
hoping that good times will return quickly and close the budget gap
painlessly.
That is certainly the tendency here in Indiana. The only revenue increases
even under consideration involve more gambling receipts and higher cigarette
taxes. Governor O'Bannon has set aside some of his most ambitious plans,
like state aid for preschool programs, but most of the cuts so far have
involved bookkeeping devices like transfers from trust funds to the general
fund and a reduction in emergency reserves. 
"The political will is not there to do what is necessary," said William J.
Sheldrake, president of the Indiana Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonpartisan
research center. 
Most authorities doubt that Indiana or other states will return soon to a
time of plenty, given two serious structural problems. 
The first is that services, the dominant element of the economy in most
states, are not taxed. For years, Florida, among other states, has
considered taxing services, from haircuts to golf lessons, but those
proposals have never gone far and are not likely to now.
The other structural problem is the huge rise in health expenditures, in
large part a result of ever higher drug costs. Health care now accounts for
27 percent of all state spending, said Ray Scheppach, executive director of
the National Governors' Association.
As the legislature convened here in Indianapolis on Tuesday, lobbyists were
out in force, but the lawmakers' mood was grim. Governor O'Bannon, a
Democrat, has said that if the legislature does not act in the special
session, he will be forced to cut spending for education and other popular
programs on his own and seek new sources of revenue. But he is not the kind
of governor who strikes fear in his opponents, said Brian Howey, who
publishes a nonpartisan political newsletter.
The Indiana House is controlled by Democrats, but the Senate by Republicans,
and the chances of reaching a bipartisan agreement are remote, most
lawmakers say.
"No question we're going to have a tough time getting anything worked out,"
said Representative William C. Cochran, a Democrat from the southeastern
part of the state.
Representative Daniel A. Dumezich, a Republican from a suburb of Chicago and
a tax lawyer, agreed. Like many others, he said the special session was "a
major inconvenience" for the part-time lawmakers, who are paid $112 a day
when they are in session and whose regular session ended for the year in
March.
"I have a real job I have to attend to," he said.

Subject: Continuning Department of Children  & Families



Jeb,

I just wanted to send you an update on Stefani  Stauffer and the Department
of Children & Families.   Thankfully,  I had cancelled my trip to
Washington DC, because yesterday, Stefani had a  status hearing at the
Pinellas Courthouse in Judge Irene Sullivan's Courtroom,  and I
was available to go with her. We spent the entire day there  trying
to resolve some simple issues.

Since I last wrote you, Stefani's case worker,  Debbie Hanson, withdrew
Stefani from Tarpon High School and was moving her to  St. Petersburg and
enrolling her in St. Petersburg High School with just 2 weeks  of classes
left and exams to take.  Stefani was beside herself with worry,  fearing
she would fail her junior year and not get her credits (she has a 3.5
GPA).  She also feared that her placement in a "theraputic facility" would
prevent her from pursuing her goal of joining the military.  She claims her
Airforce Recruiter told her that if she was on medication (her psychiatrist
had  her on Paxil which Stefani vehemently objects to) or living in a
theraputic  facility she would be ineligible for service.

Judge Sullivan listened to Stefani's case, and  ordered the case worker to
re-enroll Stefani in Tarpon High School until June  6th.  The judge felt as
I do, that taking her from the school with such a  little bit of time left
was the wrong thing to do.  The case worker argued  with the judge saying
that she needed to place Stefani in the facility  yesterday, and that St.
Petersburg High school was required to enroll her  anytime, even the last
day of school. Regardless, the judge instructed Ms.  Hanson to inquire as
to whether or not the bed could be held for 3 weeks so  that Stefani could
finish school where she was -- stating that taking exams  in a different
school for classes she never attended was not in Stefani's best  interest.
In the bed could not be held, then it was the case worker's  duty to find
transportation for Stefani to Tarpon Springs High School (about 20  miles)
or find out if Tarpon High would let Stefani  take her exams early,  so she
could finish the school year at her current school.

Immediately upon leaving the court room, the case  worker, Debbie Hanson,
called Stefani aside and told her to come with her  because she was taking
her to the facility in St. Petersburg right  then.   Stefani began to cry
and become very upset and called me over  and told me what was happening.
The case worker was very rude to me  when I asked her what was going on.
She told me that Stefani had to  go with her right then to the theraputic
facility.  I began to  disagree with the case worker saying that isn't what
the judge had just said in  the courtroom.   Because of our arguing, a
bailiff came over and  we explained the problem.  She offered to go get the
judge out of her  chamber to resolve the issue and left.   Immediately, Ms
Hanson got on  her cell phone, called the facility regarding the delay and
found out that it  was absolutely possible to hold the bed for Stefani
until school was  out.

I know for a fact that had Stefani not had me with  her,  she would have
been moved to the facility even though the judge had  instructed the
caseworker otherwise.    I am so appalled at the  way these case workers
are treating these children, and even defying the court  to do things their
own way -- and certainly not for the benefit of the  children.

I realize you have a committee looking into this  department already, and I
am seeing first hand why it is so needed.    The arrogance of these workers
is beyond belief.

Stefani has another hearing on June 12 with Judge  Sullivan where she will
be seeking emancipation.   I have committed to  helping Stefani through
this process, but unfortunately since it is all so new  to me, I am merely
a source of moral support.

Stefani wants to join the Airforce in August when  she turns 17 and is
willing to go to summer school or dual enroll at the  community college to
obtain enough credits for graduation so that she can join  this summer.
Stefani told me she needs structure and stability in her  life, and feels
that the military would provide her that plus the opportunity to  get
an education, job skills, and a certainty of a place to belong for the
next four years.  (She has lived in 18 locations in 16 yrs -- many of them
abusive). Her goal is to become a Forensic Scientist.

I can only help this one child, but I know as  Governor you can help many.
I hope this information is helpful in your  endeavor to improve the
Department of Children & Families.

Dear Jeb,

I regret that I have to write you this e-mail  at a time when you are
already faced with mounting problems with the  Department of Families and
Children but a problem arrived on my doorstep  unexpectedly and I can't
just turn away.

Over the weekend, Debbie brought a co-worker,  Stefani home to join our
family for a Sunday BBQ. Debbie had  expressed concern for this girl
because she had no parents and said her  landlord wasn't very nice to her,
so we decided to have her join us for a  family day.   During the day,
Stephani, who is  16,  told us about the exorbitant rent her landlord was
charging  her.  She explained that she pays over $600 per month rent for a
room  in the home of an employee (case worker) of the Department of
Families  & Children.  In addition,  the woman charges her extra  for food,
telephone and other incidentals, and gets angry when she has to  pick
Stefani up from work.

If that wasn't bad enough, last night, the  woman told the girl to "Pick
up your sh#$ and get out!!"    Being 16, the girl the only person she knew
she could call, a  19-year-old former foster sister to come get her.   She
was  picked up and spent the night with her foster sister.  To make
matters even worse, the landlord/caseworker, reported the girl as a
runaway today, and then had the girl's only means of communication, her
cell phone (that Stephani pays for) shut off.

Before her phone was shut off,  Stefani called Debbie  asking her what she
should do.   Debbie handed the phone to me, and I have spent an entire day
trying to  find this girl some help.  To me, this is an inexcusable
situation . . . certainly not as heinous as that of the missing
5-year-old, but certainly of major concern when those in charge of
protecting these kids are the ones taking advantage of them.

I have contacted a family court judge, the  public defender's office, the
state attorney and Gus Bilirakis's office  and am awaiting replies.   When
I spoke with the State  Attorney's office I was told I needed to contact
the girl's  caseworker.   When I explained that the problem was  with one
of the case workers in the same office, they  still insisted that I would
have to talk with the case worker if  there is a problem.  It seem to me,
that calling the case worker  who placed the girl with a co-worker who
is charging this  girl rent plus is liking asking the "wolf to watch the
hen house!"  I  was so baffled by the response, that I asked the person at
the State  Attorney's office if there was anyone who looked out
for children in  these situations and the answer I received was "I don't
know.   You have to call the case worker."

I'm sure there are all kinds of rules and  regulations that I don't know
and probably wouldn't  understand.   But what I do know is that this "case"
is not a  number but a child, without any parents, who is working hard to
maintain an 3.5 GPA in High School, works 30-40 hrs a week, and is being
grossly taking advantage of by the very people who should be looking out
for her.   I can't even explain how disgusted and frustrated I  am.

I realize you can't get involved in all the  individual cases all around
the state, but considering the current  scrutiny of this department, I
wanted to share this situation since it  seems to involve employees of the
department using their positions in an  improper way.

I will continue to work with the  professionals locally until we can find a
suitable solution for  Stefani.  My only concern is that I am leaving on
Monday for a trip  to Washington D.C. with Debbie & Lisa. Although our main
purpose  of the trip is for Debbie to  visit Georgetown University where
she is seriously considering  applying to the  School of Foreign Service,
we plan to send a couple  of extra days touring the city, since neither of
the girls have ever  visited before.  We planned the trip early so when
Debbie  returns she can begin her search for a summer job/internship or
volunteer position with an agency or organization associated with
International or Latin American Relations to further explore her  possible
career choice.

Although I'm really excited and looking  forward to taking Debbie & Lisa to
Washington, I am very concerned  with leaving Stefani.  I hope we can get
her situation  resolved before I leave on Monday, but I'm not very
optimistic  at this point.

Regardless of what happens with the  Department and Stefani's immediate
situation, I have decided that I  will continue to meet and work with
Stefani and be an adult she can trust  and count on.  She seems to be a
remarkable young lady who has dreams  and goals and appears to have the
strength of character to overcome her  difficult childhood to achieve them.
I only I hope I can help her  see them come true.

Thank you for listening.


Sincerely,

Sandy  Faulkner

Governor:

At Jerissa's hearing today, we had several staff members present along with
her private attorney and public defender (?) - not sure exactly how you
have both.  The Judge ordered her to jail for 90 days but gave her credit
for time served which means she will be released on Thursday of next week.
The FACT team will pick her up from jail as she has been sentenced to
community control for 18 months where she will also be required to wear a
electronic device.  The FACT team will transfer Jerissa to La Amistad in
Orlando where she will remain until she completes treatment or flees.  (If
she runs this time, I think the Judge may not be as lenient.)  After her 18
months of community control, she will still have to serve two years of
probation.

Below is the message I sent to the staff that worked very hard on this:
"Thanks to all of you for doing what  you have done to help this young lady
who as of yet has not been focused on helping herself.  You are angels who
are looking over her - hopefully one day she will realize it - but if not
- you all will know that you did your best to save a vulnerable client."

I pray that Jerissa will make the turn - it is now up to her to commit
herself to getting better so that she can become a functioning and
contributing member of society.  I know her mother has been through so much
and my heart goes out to her, but she must now let her daughter work
through her issues with her therapist.  Thank you for caring so deeply
about people.  You are a truly wonderful person and I so appreciate you
both as the leader of our state and as a person.  I also want to thank you
for supporting Judge Kearney - she is one of the finest and most committed
people I have ever had the pleasure of working for.

Governor:

Just to update you on Jerissa's situation.  The department is working
with
her attorney in order to have an opportunity to speak at her hearing
tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m.  We are going to recommend that she be
allowed to enter the program at La Amistad.  The district has agreement
from the provider that she can be admitted here and have worked out a
rate
agreement with them. (The issue still remains that this is not a locked
facility ? if she runs she will again be violating a court order.
However
there is no locked facility available in Florida and as you know Ms.
Adkins
has been adamant that she be placed at La Amistad)  From what I
understand,
her probation officer (Linda Adkins,DC) does not agree with DCF's
recommendation regarding La Amistad and is going to recommend jail to
the
judge in her case. (This may be based upon the fact that  Jerissa was
found
with contraband at the Crisis Stabilization Unit last week - she had
methadone in her possession)  She clearly has a serious drug abuse issue
?
getting this inside this type of facility should be a pretty difficult
task!

 Celeste Putnam has been in contact Jerissa's mother, Rhonda Adkins and
apparently she is still attempting to place the blame for Jerissa's
actions
on the department.  She still appears not to want to admit the
seriousness
of her daughter's problems, but we are still trying to do whatever we
can
to protect her.

Please let me know if you need anything further.

Subject:	Swimming Pools...

Trudy,
Have the Blue Ribbon Panel addressed the issue of children drowning?  Seems to be a concern lately with the number of drownings in recent months.  
 
It's my opinion that children sent into fosterhomes with pools be given a swimming test.  IF they pass the test, they are okay to stay.  IF they do not pass the test, they must have a certified swimming class within 90 days of moving in to the home. (The YMCA offers the courses) I am all for pool barriers, but humans will err and leave gates open, fences down at some point in time.  Not to mention children will be visiting friends and there may not be pool protection.  I am an advocate for protecting the children, not the pools.  Protection that lasts for a lifetime and very cost efficient.

Dear Governor, I don't believe for one minute that you wrote the answer to my 
e-mail "Re: previous e-mail and its explanation." I do believe that you told 
someone what to say. You are too well educated to spell "origin" as "origen." 
 In the future, please address me as Mrs. Kreimer. I am married.

I find it incredibly disappointing that you would be so insensitive to the 
feelings of the world around you that you would even consider appointing a 
Pakistani to the Board of the North Broward Hospital District, or any other 
Board in Florida, at this time. How could you have really read the last 
paragraph of my e-mail and send me that answer!  The Pakistanis are not 
friends of The United States of America. Literally just a few days ago, 
Pakistanis refused to let our soldiers search their country for Bin Laden. 
Also, politically, your lack of understanding or caring about the opinions of 
a large portion of your citizenry astounds me. Florida has the third largest 
Jewish population in the country. How will they react to your stand, in 
November? How will the policemen and firemen who helped in New York after 
9/11 react? How will you do in November when the men and women they inform of 
your beliefs react, all over the state? Isn't it true that one reason you are 
considering such a bad choice is because Bill Scherer is pushing Gul Cumber 
so that he can control the Board, and you are letting him get away with it in 
spite of his grave misdeeds because he raises so much money for you? Shame on 
you! Where is your loyalty to Florida? Where is your loyalty to our country?

Jeb,
 
I'm sure there is two sides to this story, and I realize I am only hearing one side --  except for what I heard in the courtroom, where all parties were present.  I'm sorry I was misinformed about the DCF employee, thank you for correcting me.  
As I have said before, I'm sure this is very complicated and involved, and there are many laws and rules I am just unaware of.   I am just trying to be a friend, mentor, and a source of love and care to this young girl.   
 
I hope I haven't mislead you.  I appreciate your interest in this individual case, but please understand that I have forwarded this information to you because I hoped it would be beneficial in your study of the department.   I know you are very, very busy and didn't expect your personal attention.  As a citizen, I realize it is my responsibility to reach out and help others -- but I can help only individuals, and I know you can help many.
 
Again, I apologize for the incorrect information.  I didn't realize that there were numerous agencies involved.  I am confident that Judge Sullivan will gather all the facts and make a sound decision on June 12th.  I appreciate all everyone has done. 
 
Thank you for all you do everyday.   I'm proud to have you as our Governor.

Jeb,
 
I just wanted to send you an update on Stefani Stauffer and the Department of Children & Families.   Thankfully, I had cancelled my trip to Washington DC, because yesterday, Stefani had a status hearing at the Pinellas Courthouse in Judge Irene Sullivan's Courtroom, and I was available to go with her. We spent the entire day there trying to resolve some simple issues.  
 
Since I last wrote you, Stefani's case worker, Debbie Hanson, withdrew Stefani from Tarpon High School and was moving her to St. Petersburg and enrolling her in St. Petersburg High School with just 2 weeks of classes left and exams to take.  Stefani was beside herself with worry, fearing she would fail her junior year and not get her credits (she has a 3.5 GPA).  She also feared that her placement in a "theraputic facility" would prevent her from pursuing her goal of joining the military.  She claims her Airforce Recruiter told her that if she was on medication (her psychiatrist had her on Paxil which Stefani vehemently objects to) or living in a theraputic facility she would be ineligible for service.
 
Judge Sullivan listened to Stefani's case, and ordered the case worker to re-enroll Stefani in Tarpon High School until June 6th.  The judge felt as I do, that taking her from the school with such a little bit of time left was the wrong thing to do.  The case worker argued with the judge saying that she needed to place Stefani in the facility yesterday, and that St. Petersburg High school was required to enroll her anytime, even the last day of school. Regardless, the judge instructed Ms. Hanson to inquire as to whether or not the bed could be held for 3 weeks so that Stefani could finish school where she was -- stating that taking exams in a different school for classes she never attended was not in Stefani's best interest.  In the bed could not be held, then it was the case worker's duty to find transportation for Stefani to Tarpon Springs High School (about 20 miles) or find out if Tarpon High would let Stefani  take her exams early, so she could finish the school year at her current school.
 
Immediately upon leaving the court room, the case worker, Debbie Hanson, called Stefani aside and told her to come with her because she was taking her to the facility in St. Petersburg right then.   Stefani began to cry and become very upset and called me over and told me what was happening.   The case worker was very rude to me when I asked her what was going on.  She told me that Stefani had to go with her right then to the theraputic facility.  I began to disagree with the case worker saying that isn't what the judge had just said in the courtroom.   Because of our arguing, a bailiff came over and we explained the problem.  She offered to go get the judge out of her chamber to resolve the issue and left.   Immediately, Ms Hanson got on her cell phone, called the facility regarding the delay and found out that it was absolutely possible to hold the bed for Stefani until school was out.
 
I know for a fact that had Stefani not had me with her,  she would have been moved to the facility even though the judge had instructed the caseworker otherwise.    I am so appalled at the way these case workers are treating these children, and even defying the court to do things their own way -- and certainly not for the benefit of the children.
 
I realize you have a committee looking into this department already, and I am seeing first hand why it is so needed.   The arrogance of these workers is beyond belief.
 
Stefani has another hearing on June 12 with Judge Sullivan where she will be seeking emancipation.   I have committed to helping Stefani through this process, but unfortunately since it is all so new to me, I am merely a source of moral support.    
 
Stefani wants to join the Airforce in August when she turns 17 and is willing to go to summer school or dual enroll at the community college to obtain enough credits for graduation so that she can join this summer.  Stefani told me she needs structure and stability in her life, and feels that the military would provide her that plus the opportunity to get an education, job skills, and a certainty of a place to belong for the next four years.  (She has lived in 18 locations in 16 yrs -- many of them abusive). Her goal is to become a Forensic Scientist.
 
I can only help this one child, but I know as Governor you can help many.  I hope this information is helpful in your endeavor to improve the Department of Children & Families.

Dear Jeb,
 
I regret that I have to write you this e-mail at a time when you are already faced with mounting problems with the Department of Families and Children but a problem arrived on my doorstep unexpectedly and I can't just turn away.  
 
Over the weekend, Debbie brought a co-worker, Stefani home to join our family for a Sunday BBQ. Debbie had expressed concern for this girl because she had no parents and said her landlord wasn't very nice to her, so we decided to have her join us for a family day.   During the day, Stephani, who is 16,  told us about the exorbitant rent her landlord was charging her.  She explained that she pays over $600 per month rent for a room in the home of an employee (case worker) of the Department of Families & Children.  In addition,  the woman charges her extra for food, telephone and other incidentals, and gets angry when she has to pick Stefani up from work.   
 
If that wasn't bad enough, last night, the woman told the girl to "Pick up your sh#$ and get out!!"   Being 16, the girl the only person she knew she could call, a 19-year-old former foster sister to come get her.   She was picked up and spent the night with her foster sister.  To make matters even worse, the landlord/caseworker, reported the girl as a runaway today, and then had the girl's only means of communication, her cell phone (that Stephani pays for) shut off.
 
Before her phone was shut off, Stefani called Debbie  asking her what she should do.  Debbie handed the phone to me, and I have spent an entire day trying to find this girl some help.  To me, this is an inexcusable situation . . . certainly not as heinous as that of the missing 5-year-old, but certainly of major concern when those in charge of  protecting these kids are the ones taking advantage of them.
 
I have contacted a family court judge, the public defender's office, the state attorney and Gus Bilirakis's office and am awaiting replies.   When I spoke with the State Attorney's office I was told I needed to contact the girl's caseworker.   When I explained that the problem was with one of the case workers in the same office, they still insisted that I would have to talk with the case worker if there is a problem.  It seem to me, that calling the case worker who placed the girl with a co-worker who is charging this girl rent plus is liking asking the "wolf to watch the hen house!"  I was so baffled by the response, that I asked the person at the State Attorney's office if there was anyone who looked out for children in these situations and the answer I received was "I don't know.  You have to call the case worker."    
 
I'm sure there are all kinds of rules and regulations that I don't know and probably wouldn't understand.   But what I do know is that this "case" is not a number but a child, without any parents, who is working hard to maintain an 3.5 GPA in High School, works 30-40 hrs a week, and is being grossly taking advantage of by the very people who should be looking out for her.   I can't even explain how disgusted and frustrated I am.
 
I realize you can't get involved in all the individual cases all around the state, but considering the current scrutiny of this department, I wanted to share this situation since it seems to involve employees of the department using their positions in an improper way.
 
I will continue to work with the professionals locally until we can find a suitable solution for Stefani.  My only concern is that I am leaving on Monday for a trip to Washington D.C. with Debbie & Lisa. Although our main purpose of the trip is for Debbie to visit Georgetown University where she is seriously considering applying to the  School of Foreign Service, we plan to send a couple of extra days touring the city, since neither of the girls have ever visited before.  We planned the trip early so when Debbie returns she can begin her search for a summer job/internship or volunteer position with an agency or organization associated with International or Latin American Relations to further explore her possible career choice.   
 
Although I'm really excited and looking forward to taking Debbie & Lisa to Washington, I am very concerned with leaving Stefani.  I hope we can get her situation resolved before I leave on Monday, but I'm not very optimistic at this point.  
 
Regardless of what happens with the Department and Stefani's immediate situation, I have decided that I will continue to meet and work with Stefani and be an adult she can trust and count on.  She seems to be a remarkable young lady who has dreams and goals and appears to have the strength of character to overcome her difficult childhood to achieve them.  I only I hope I can help her see them come true.  
 
Thank you for listening.   
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Sandy Faulkner

Subject: Everglades Bill 




May 16, 2002 

Dear Govenor Bush: 

I read with regret your signing of the "Everglades" bill.  I switched party affiliation to support you and your brother in the last election. I was so bothered by the Clinton Democrats that I wanted to distance myself from that dirty mess.   I have been a strong supporter of yours since the election, but this one vote, plus countless other positions you take to favor big business  or private business over the average Florida citizen, have made me doubt the wisdom of my previous support. 

I continue to believe that the Everglades bill, while looking like it will do good for the Everglades, and it probably will, will be known as the bill that took away the First Amendment rights of Florida residents to voice their objection to issues that threaten the environment. One should not have to "join an organized group" to speak against issues that one considers harmful to our environment.  One should have standing in court to file objections. 

You may feel comfortable with your signing this bill; I am sorry and disappointed. You could have sent it back to have the harmful language removed.   It is one more example of why I question my support for you.  I CANNOT support Janet Reno, but I am looking for someone to support for  Govenor.    

I will not support a candidate who only favors "big business" at the expense of the average citizen. I won't support a candidate who keeps chipping away at educational funding by taking things like the "reading initiative" to your office and allowing the Early Intervention Programs to be taken away from public education and given to private child care providers who do not have the experience or training to educate preschoolers.  I cannot support issues such as taking away the duties of the DCA and the DEP and returning those responsibilities to corrupt local governments. I can't support oil drilling off the coast of Florida.   So far, the only reason I have to vote for you is that I can't vote for Janet Reno, and that makes me feel like I am between "a Hawk and a Buzzard" as my dear grandmother used to say. 

Today I am feeling our choices for govenor are very limited.  I hope you can do something between now and the election to restore my faith in you as a viable candidate for govenor and in my own judgement.      

Sincerely, 

Barbara K. Miner

I want to bring to your attention an important Second District Court of
Appeals decision that was issued on May 10, 2002.  The case is captioned
Times Publishing Company v. City of Clearwater, 2002 WL 944630 (Fla.App.
2
Dist.).  The decision is not final until expiration of the 15-day period
for
filing of a motion for rehearing.  If a motion is timely filed, the
decision
would not be final until such motion is denied.
 
The case involves the Times' demand for e-mails between two City
employees.
The e-mails were withheld on the employees' assertion that they were
private
in nature and were not "public records."  The appellate court affirmed
the
trial court's opinion that: 

*	E-mails stored in government computers do not automatically
become
public records by virtue of that storage; 

*	"Private" or "personal" e-mails simply fall outside the current
definition of public records; 

*	Such e-mail is not "made or received pursuant to law or
ordinance...or received "in connection with  official business or the
transaction of official business of the City; and

*	Although digital in nature, there is little to distinguish such
e-mail from personal letters delivered to government workers via a
government post office box and stored in government-owned desk.

The Times argued that the City's official records custodian designated
by
section Sec. 119.021, F.S. (2000), was required to review each e-mail to
determine whether the employee properly designated it as "nonpublic
record."
Because the City allowed the individual employees to perform this
function
without any oversight, the Times maintained that it "failed to fulfill
its
obligations as custodian."  The court disagreed, pointing out that the
statute referred to the "custodian" as the elected officer "or his or
her
designee."

The court did say that the Times could seek an in camera inspection of
the
e-mails by the trial court to determine whether they were public or
private
in nature.

It is important to note what the case did not involve:

*	E-mail that may have been isolated by a government employee
whose
job required him or her to locate employee misuse of government
computers.

*	A balancing of the public's interest in open public records and
an
individual's right to privacy.  The two employees involved in the case
did
not assert such a right.  In fact, the City had published a computer
resources use policy stating generally stating that computer resources
belong to the City and that users have no expectation of privacy as to
documents created, stored, sent, ore received.  (Note: This policy could
preclude assertion of a right of privacy but could not and did not alter
the
statutory definition of public records.)

*	This case does not involve an in camera inspection of public
records.  The primary issue on appeal was whether all e-mail stored on a
public entity's computer system is public record simply by virtue of its
placement on a public resource. The Times sought a bright-line ruling
that
all e-mail on the City's computer system was "public record."

For as long as I've been at the Department, I have taken the position
that
private e-mails are not public records for the very reasons expressed by
the
appellate court. It is my understanding that our practice in responding
to
public records requests is consistent with this position.  Incidentally,
this has not been a position shared by the Attorney General's Office.  I
will let you know as soon as the decision is final.  In the meantime, if
you
have any question or comment, or if you would like a copy of the
decision,
please let me know.

Jim

Bob ... attached is the Magistrate's recommendation to the Judge regarding the 8.5 Square Mile Area residents' case ... in a nutshell, the Magistrate says the Corps' 6D plan is contrary to law (PL101-229 as amended).  2 points:

*	As you well know we expected that this was the case ... and that Mod Waters would once again be delayed and Tribal land would continue to be destroyed.  Now hopefully this will inspire the Corps to move with haste in implementing it's 1992 congressionally approved plan which protects the 8.5 SMA as Congress explicitly directed and save the Everglades before it can't be saved ... immediately stop the condemnation of property that has already begun ... not destroy the 100 homes in the 6D plan that the Magistrate believes you have no lawful right to destroy. And certainly is not necessary for restoration. 

*	There will be those who now work to change the law ... waste more precious time and resources ... we must be vigilant to ensure that PL101-229 endures so that the project can be implemented as fast as possible so that the Tribe's land isn't totally destroyed, along with Everglades National Park, Florida Bay, and areas to the north ... so that the flooding of people in Miami-Dade county is greatly reduced ... and so that the incessant uncertainty and fear that the people of the 8.5 SMA have experienced for more than 2 decades stops.

The truth of the matter is that the quick accomplishment of this Mod Waters project is a strategic imperative ... a center of gravity ... for the long-term success of Everglades restoration as well as the future of the Corps ... you're the leader who can put the train back on the track ... we ask and hope for decisive action.

I am not trying to be annoying!  I am getting a little nervous with the
return letter's, since it is already Wednesday.  I know that this is
going
be difficult and I truly appreciate your help.  I am hearing rumors of
pre-selection again and the only way I can combat this is with some
political clout.  I am tired of being a victim to the state politics in
referance to the Air Guard.  Thank's for your help in making this a fair
playing field to the selection process.  My family and I are very
appreciative of your efforts.
Take Care!

Shan has some details on this situation.  It seems that Joey has only been

district has provided some options that are not acceptable to the parents.

Dear Governor Bush ,

I am sure by now you have heard about my son Joey Meyer " Let Joey Walk"
a 
student with Down Syndrome that attended St. Cloud High School.

Contrary to the school boards official press release Joey was indeed do
to 
Graduate in May 2002.  I have documents from his IEP ...signed off by 
multiple people from the IEP team stating he was graduating in May 
2002,  letter from the school concerning graduation addressed to the 
parents of Joseph Francis Meyer and dated Feb. 8th ,  I also have hand 
written notes in Joeys Daily Agenda from his teacher. These are not 
computer generated mistakes. Joey has had his Senior Graduation picture 
taken in cap and gown and appears in the yearbook senior class picture.
Senator Bill Nelson has stepped in to give Joey an internship position
in 
his Orlando office. This would give him the 4 credits that the school 
neglected to provide. Joey is an A/B student and has a 3.76 grade
average. 
The school is not accepting Senator Nelsons' offer. I'm sure you
understand 
this is a once in a life time opportunity for him. Even though all of
this 
is St. Clouds mistake they still will not even let him walk in the 
ceremony. It is the schools job to follow through on his IEP. In
addition , 
I'm sure you heard that students protested on Wednesday to request the 
Principal , Mr. Sullivan accept their petitions. He would not. They were

removed by the police and still may be facing charges. As Joey's mom I
ask 
that you please look into this situation.

Sincerely , Sharon Meyer

Dear Governor Bush ,

Thank You for your response. No , this situation has not been resolved but 
I hear from people who have called the school that they are being told that 
Joey will walk. St. Cloud has to stop issuing false statements.

Heather Sullivan , one of the Seniors who was removed by the police and may 
have charges pending against her in the future is at my house now. She has 
been suspended and unable to take her final exams. She is going into the 
military and I hate to see any of this appear on her records. A simple 
solution to the students silent sit in would have been for Mr. Sullivan , 
the Principal to accept the students petition. These students did what was 
right in their eyes because they have seen my documents.
my son , Joey , probably will not walk or graduate this year as promised 
but please don't let St. Cloud High School ruin the future careers of these 
other students.
It is also my understanding that city officials have taken it upon 
themselves to call the Veterans Association in an attempt to stop the 
wonderful graduation they are planning for Joey this Sunday at the American 
Legions Post 10 , Kissimmee at 2:00....how sad. This just is not right.

Governor Bush,
I have never personally emailed or written to you, but I feel the time has come.  I know you are a fan of email, but whether or not you respond is still a mystery.
First I must say that I am a Democrat.  When you were elected I accepted it and really had no significant grudge with you as the election was legitimate and you won fair and square (at least as far as I know).  I was not politically involved and basically just voted every 2 years.  However, after the 2000 election I have become involved, and in a big way locally.  I will help whoever is running against you to win because I feel that you have done the people of Florida and the USA a disservice.  The way you and Katherine Harris purged the voting rolls is just totally unacceptable in my view.  I have friends who marched in Selma with Rev. Martin Luther King, people who were willing to die for the right to vote.  Those same people feel as if they were taken back to the pre- 1965 Voting Rights Act days.  By disenfranchising them, we all were disenfranchised.  Now, it seems as if you are just so pro big business and corporations and so against the average person.  Did your children go to public schools?  If not, you most likely have no idea how crowded they are.  My daughters pre-IB French class has over 45 kids in it!!! 45!!!! And she goes to an A school.  If we don't fund education now, our future will be grave as these kids are the future.  If we don't watch out for our environment now, we may not have a future.  There has been reports that show that 60% of Florida may be underwater in less than 100  years if we don't level off Global Warming, which is indeed a real phenomenon.  Look at our weather patterns and the melting of the polar ice caps.  Don't you care what the future will hold for your children, and their children?  We all have a responsibility to do our best.  The almighty buck is not everything.  We must stop and access what is really important. I know what Florida used to be like, and when I stop and think of it now I feel like crying.  Gone is the Florida of my youth, and in its place is an ever growing cement state.  Just remember that people in Florida want results not just talk, and they want someone who really cares about the people, the land, and the future of our great state.
Sincerely,
L.Fink

Jupiter resident continues to battle homeowners group over flag 
--------------------

By Randall Murray
The Jupiter Courier

May 15, 2002

JUPITER * Even though the homeowners association that has battled
Jupiter resident George Andres for 18 months over his flag and flagpole
has filed foreclosure proceedings against the former Marine, Andres'
attorney said a new state law should help protect him.

Andres' attorney, Barry Silver, called the Indian Creek Phase III-B
association unreasonable and mean-spirited" for its effort to collect
more than $30,000 in fines.

He said he does not think Andres and his wife, Ann, are in any immediate
danger of losing their modest home at 125 Doe Trail.

"We had to have a law passed to get this ridiculous association off the
Andreses' back. But they disregard the governor and relentlessly pursue
this nonsense."

Andres, 64, has attracted international attention with his fight against
the association over a 12-foot flagpole and American flag he erected in
his front yard in 2000.

This week, the association filed a lawsuit to foreclose on the Andreses'
one-story home for payment of fines and penalties assessed by Palm Beach
County Circuit Court Judge Catherine Brunson.

Brunson has ruled twice against Andres.

The association's action was taken in spite of passage in March by
Florida's Legislature of a law that prohibits homeowners associations
from restricting the display of the American flag by property owners.

The law stipulates the flag must be displayed in a "respectful" manner
and that the pole be "portable." According to Andres, his flag and pole
meet both standards.

West Palm Beach attorney Steven Selz, who represents the association,
said "the new law does not change the fact that there has been a
judgment entered [by Brunson]. The new law does not undo that."

Selz said the association will move "as soon as possible" on the
foreclosure. Selz put the value of the Andres home at "about $65,000."

But Ann Andres put the price tag higher -- "at least $80,000," she said.
"We put a new kitchen and bathroom in here." They moved into the home in
June 1998.

Silver said he will file an appeal and motions to have the original case
reheard.

Kind sir, 

As you probably know, like you and the Lt. Governor, I am well
acquainted with Donnie Read and his programs over in Liberty and Jackson
Counties. I'm a big supporter of his concept for helping problemed
juveniles return to society as productive citizens. We need more Donnie
Reads and Twin Oak like programs in Florida. Donnie and staff are worthy
of praise in a time when Juvenile justice and children and family
services  and the like are under attack! In fact, I plan to use my media
contacts around the state to get some great publicity for the
accomplishments over there.  In the meantime, I need your help to make
sure that this program succeeds and doesn't get bogged down. Please see
the attached letter and program overview!

Your friend and supporter,

   Dear Governor Bush:                                                          5/17/02




I would like to take a moment of your time and express my support for CS/SB 160 also known as the "Debbie Wasserman-Schultz Act."

During the recent legislative session, members of both the House and Senate recognized the benefit of a charity and scholarship day fundraising by granting dog tracks the authority to conduct a special "Greyhound Adopt a Pet Day" to raise funds to promote greyhound adoption. CS/BS 160 will also help to fund the volunteer operated greyhound adoption program.

CS/BS 160 further provides for changes to the number of days and hours of operation of card rooms as well as replacing the ten-dollar "pot limit" with a limited two-dollar "bet limit."  These changes will re-energize the State's declining racetrack card rooms, create needed jobs and generate purse money, State tax and track revenue.



   We as a Not for Profit local social group work with the PAL and feel strongly about   
   those who want to give old greyhouds a home. 




Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Sincerely,

fyi.....this threat does NOT appear to be "low risk" and  probably not
credible......the Orlando Regional Domestic Security Task Force is in the
process of identifying  the source of the threat and is currently looking
for him (see the attached photos from surviellance cameras).  He is believed
to still be in the Orlando area.

This threat proved that our system works and works well......including the
interface with the business community via the convention center.

Will keep you posted.

Dear Governor Bush:

Thank you for your leadership once again.  I must extend my sincere
gratitude for your participation in the Putney show and the state-wide
drug court graduation ceremony in Dade.  Please extend my thanks to your
lovely wife, who took the time to participate.

On behalf of my husband, Robert Koch, who is the drug court coordinator

court team member, thank you.

It meant so much to so many for you and your wife, and Director
McDonough, to take so much of your time to share the day with us.

You and Mrs. Bush and Director McDonough are making such a significant
difference in dealing with this pervasive problem in our State -- thank
you.

I apologize for leaving early.  I had promised the Broward County Drug
Court to be there for their closing so I raced to Fort Lauderdale, under
the speed limit of course, to hand out certificates. Safe trip home and
the best to your family.

Good Afternoon,


I have confirmed, as of May 17th, Daryl Jones and Alex Sink (for Bill
McBride's Campaign)for the June 22, 2002 Business and Professional Women's
State Annual Conference.  Governor Bush and Lt. Governor Brogan are unable
to attend, so Secretary of State Board of Education Jim Horne has been
invited.  Janet Reno and Lois Frankel are working with scheduling.  I would
like to hear from each participant as quickly as possible so I can make a
press announcement to all thirteen hundred Business and Professional Women
Club members across the state of Florida.  I would also like to inform the
TV, radio and newsprint outlets of the Ft Lauderdale / Miami, West Palm and
Palm Beach areas of the details of this event as soon as possible.  As we
all know, without sufficient notice, the press will not be happy.  Education
is a very important issue for all who live in Florida.  It is paramount to
the members of BPW FL.  Your participation is vital.

Thank you for your timely attention to this matter.  I look forward to
speaking with each of you in the near future.

			Invitation


The Florida State Business and Professional Women's Annual Conference is
in Palm Beach Gardens this year. On Saturday, June 22, the Florida Education
Foundation of the Florida Federation of Business and Professional Women
would like to invite you to participate in a panel discussion on:
 "The State of Education in the State of Florida"  "Where are we now and
where do we need to be.  What will it take to get us there."
Each candidate for the office of Governor for the State of Florida has been
invited to participate.

This year, with the race for governor in Florida, being as important as it
is to Education Issues within Florida, the board felt it was important that
each BPW member had an opportunity to hear the philosophy and plans of each
of our candidates.  I would like to invite each of you to participate in a
panel discussion on this issue.  This discussion will be held during the
Education Foundation's Formal Luncheon, 11:00 am till 2:00 pm.  We will
provide a professional moderator for the event. Your participation is
crucial.  Further information will be supplied prior to the event.  Please
check your calendars and let me know your plans.  The conference will be
held at the Palm Beach Gardens Marriott located at 4000 RCA Blvd.

The Education Foundation of BPW Florida was created in 1965 for the specific
and unique purpose of building Scholarship Houses to accommodate the housing
needs of female university students who would otherwise be unable to further
their education. BPW Scholarship Houses are located on University campuses
located in Tallahassee at FSU, in Orlando at UCF and the newest house was
dedicated in August of 1996 in Boca Raton at FAU.

In the beginning, piggy banks were given to each member to donate $.25 per
month and asked to return the filled bank at the Annual Conference at a "Hog
Callin" Event- we still collect money in this fashion thirty years later
(with a few other fundraising methods in between!

As you can see, education is very important to us.
I look forward to speaking with your representative in the near future.

The latest FCAT results for Central Florida Schools still has a lot of room for improvement. In order to significantly change the results we get from our schools every parent of every student needs to spend at least two to three hours per month in their childrens class. Without a productive partnership between teachers and parents nothing will change. The only way to get parents in the classrooms is by getting employers to encourage or maybe even make it mandatory for employees of school age children to spend paid time in the schools. If these employers care about the community they will embrace this approach realizing it is good for their workers, the workers families, and the community at large. Plus in the long run the employee will be enriched, and the employer will have a better trained pool of workers to hire from as results in our schools get better. Our county commissions can help by maikng a concerted effort for every student to have a library card and work with the schools to track use. Lets stop heaping blame on schools and teachers because they can not do this alone. To improve School performance the cities, counties and business community has to get involved in ways they are not currently. Namely work to get parents who are emplyed by the various entities in the schools. Results take effort and a new type of leadership. If these FCAT scores do not signal a wake up call, what will ? If we are not making things better for our children then shame on us. More money for education is no substitute for parental involvement.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
 
 
I need your assistance in a very important matter. As you know Orange County Public Schools and Cyber High  Charter of Orange County have been in a dispute over transportation costs and the withholding of state funds from the school. The reason I am writing is that I went to pick up our FTE and capital outlay check today as well as a grant check and I was told we don't have  any for Cyber. I then called Jason Powell, the charter school coordinator and he indicated there was an e-mail that Dr. Boekhoff sent me in regards to withholding these funds because of our landlord that has an assignment with the court. First of all we should have received some money. We are still operating and have one more week of school. We have teachers to pay. They are withholding our operating funds.
Please see what you can do to get these funds released immediately.
Parents are very upset. We have a majority of hispanic and black students at our school. On behalf of Cyber High, we would appreciate assistance in this matter.     
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Leona Rachman

Dear Governor Bush,

Just wanted to follow up on our conversation of several weeks ago.  The
reorganization of the SFMWD top management was discussed with senior staff
on Wednesday and takes effect today.  This will greatly reduce the
bureaucracy and streamline the "top heavy" management which currently
exists.

On another note, the district currently has $298 million dollars for land
acquisition, (some of which is carry forward monies) and we have ear marked
in the budget with a specific plan for actual expenditure in fiscal year 03.
That should make a lot of people very happy.

Have a great weekend, call me if you need me.

Thank you.

Dear Governor,

Congratulations for the 2002 FCAT results.  According to the newspapers "students across Florida scored better overall than last year on the standardized test, part of Gov. Jeb Bush's A+ Plan for Education."

Your courageous vision of how our students should be teached basic skills of reading and math will at the end be rewarded by irrefutable results.  The progress shown by the FCAT scores will challenge students and teachers to set higher standards for improvement for next year.

Once again, congratulations.

Best regards.

Susan, I have spoken to George and told him that I support his efforts.
For the life of me, I can't understand why Old Glory can't be flown. I
signed a bill into law to try to help. Common sense dictates that an
American flag should be allowed to be flown within some constraints like
size, etc. The fact that we have to pass a law to deal with this shows
that we need to get back to the basics which starts with self
governance. I will continue to support George.

It has been a major blow to our community here due to the fact that of employees and famililes as well as suppliers he uses locally.  He had no insurance.  I briefly mentioned it to my dad and he said put me down as a sponsor cuz I am gonna throw a huge benefit to help.  But Jeb, isn't there programs out there that can help?  He held on through all the ups and downs of the economy over the past 20+ years, and his boards can be found all over the world but mostly up and down the east coast of the US.  I think I can raise enough money to get it back up and running (I'm good at raising money lol).  It just really is scarey due to the fact that those surfboards effect lots of families from jobs to shops.  His own shop is still standing but the factory burned.  Would someone like him qualify for help somewhere?

Austin and Bill-

Just was told by a reporter from the Globe and Mail that at their meeting
today in Buffalo, Gov. Ridge offered to Deputy PM Manley to exempt Canadian
Snowbirds from the new, proposed rule.

I always saw the Canadians as being treated separately, but I do wonder if
the folks over at the Justice Department are going to like Ridge's offer.

Here's the text from the Globe and Mail article:

?--------------------------------
Visa rules won't affect 'snowbirds,' Ridge promises

By OLIVER MOORE

Globe and Mail Update

Thursday, May 16 * Online Edition, Posted at 1:33 PM EST



Deputy Prime Minister John Manley received personal assurances Thursday from
a senior U.S. official that Canadians who prefer to spend their winters in
sunnier climes will not be subject to strict new visa rules proposed by the
White House.

The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service is mulling over new
regulations restricting foreign visitors to a maximum of 30 days, instead of
the current six months. Snowbirds' associations have lobbied fiercely for an
exemption from any such rule, and have been bolstered in their fight by
vocal support from business groups in southern U.S. states.

INS spokesman Chris Bentley told globeandmail.com early this week that
Canadians could not expect to be given special treatment. He said that
immigration officers would have the latitude to assess how long visitors
might need to fulfil their stated purpose for visiting.

But Director of Homeland Security Tom Ridge, at an announcement with Mr.
Manley in Buffalo, said Thursday that his government has no intention of
impeding the travel plans of the more than 100,000 Canadians who live in the
United States part of the year. Rules have not been completed, he said, but
he was confident that they would not "alter in any way the relationship
[snowbirds] have with us."

Canadian Snowbird Association executive director Heather Nicholson-Morrison
said this week that they appreciate assurances from the U.S. government that
new regulations would not affect them, but that they'd also prefer to see it
in writing.

Mr. Ridge said he could not immediately offer the guarantee that Ms.
Nicholson-Morrison had demanded, but promised that the appropriate agencies
would work out the details.

"We understand their concern, but we don't think there's any need for
concern."

Good morning Jeb:
Thank you so much for the personalized thank you cards to the kids at HEM
Club for their recent letters to you with the "artistic" renditions of
the American flag. They were on cloud 9. I also recevied word from Liza
McFadden that I will be receiving a letter signed by you which may be
included in my book. Thank you for believing in me and my message. I feel
honored you feel this endeavor merits your personal consideration. 

I continue to forge ahead and have spoken with Publicity people at HARPO
Inc. at Oprah Winfrey's office in Chicago. They have had me send info and
they have a copy of the "Resurrection of America" book. I was given an
in-house fax and contact person to communicate with regarding the
potential of talking about the book on an Oprah show and also they are
reviewing for possible liner notes from Oprah.....

I have faxed a request to Jim Towey, National Director-Faith-based and
Community Initiatives, The White House, recently appointed by President
Bush...am awaiting word on an appropriate address to send copy of book
for Mr Towey's possible liner notes from a Philosophical/Religious
perspective....I would also like to get a copy of the book to First Lady,
Laura Bush if I can acquire an appropriate address where she will be sure
to receive it.

You have me on your side, Jeb. Keep up the great work on behalf of kids
and education. As my book relates through the ideas offered in the book,
there are unlimited new jobs and new small business opportunities
associated with the "resurrection process", particularly in the area of
Education. 

Let me know if I can ever be of help in keeping and assuring education is
Florida and America's #1 priority.

Copy of e-mail to:
Zephyrhills Correctional Institution
Dear Sirs:
You are aware of the past problems of obtaining incontinence products for one of your young inmates, Christopher Elliott 0- TO2393. 
It is beyond my comprehension why Zephyrhills Correctional Institution is continuing to supplement his adult diapers with chucks (bed sheets) that are taped to him.  Zephyrhills CI and the DOC Medical Department has had sufficient time to obtain and keep these supplies in stock.
Your substitution of the use of bed sheets are not sanitary, comfortable, or medically appropriate.
The DOC has not completed the Medical review that was started on his spinal system and Mr. Elliott's health is seriously deteriorating.
The lack of medical and mental health treatment for young inmate is degrading, inhuman, and unconscionable.

McCoy and Neugent, residents of municipalities. Adding one resident of a
municipality will be the final straw. We understand part of the reason is
because candidates are elected at large but commission business is about 90
percent unincorporated county items.
	I wish to offer and enter my name for services for the remainder to
Commissioner Williams' tenure with an absolute promise not to be a candidate
for the slot in November. I know everyone is interested in the votes the
municipalities carry we cannot let the balance be upset. I am 73 years old
and expect to last another seven months and will serve the Republican Party
well. If not accepted, of all those listed, I favor Islamorada resident
Keith Douglas as he has the experience to immediately be in position for the
forthcoming budget although he will not be as good as I.
	We do not wish to turn upside down as the Spiegel Grove did yesterday -
remain afloat!

Dear Governor Bush,

It was an honor to for all of us in Daytona Beach to welcome you here for the National Day of Prayer Celebration at the Daytona International Speedway.  I want to personally thank you for coming on behalf of all of the pastors and participants.  It was a joy for me to see how passionately you love  God's Word, and enjoyed worshipping Him in that unique setting.  So many commented afterwords that you just "blended in" and tried not to draw any attention to yourself, so that the focus could be on Jesus and praying to His Father. They noticed your gentle manner and humility.  For that we thank God.   

Walde, Charla and Liz were all very helpful, professional and just plain nice to work with in advance of the event. I appreciated their help very much.  We continue to pray for you daily, now as before: That you will enjoy what you do and even have some fun doing it. Thank you again, Governor. (and also for the note that you sent afterwords)   

Pastor Brad Durtschi

P.S. Wouldn't it be fun to have a "family reunion" back here in May of 2004 (in 2 years) with your parents, brother, spouses, etc.? Maybe Michael W. Smith too.  Just a crazy thought.  May God continue to bless you and your family abundantly.

Robert, I concur with you completely. The intangibles of learning are important. They are the stimulus to achieve. Having said that, I don't believe measuring where kids stand compared to standards established by educators is contradictory to what you say. I am glad you concur. Have a great weekend.

Subject: A World Of Individuals


As is the case with many other teachers, I have always been amazed by the 
number of former students who phone from Los Angeles, Boston, S. Korea, and 
Germany. Then there are e-mails from all over the world. In the past month I 
have had dinner with a former student from Los Angeles, a call from a former 
student, now an attorney in Boston, and lunch with someone returning from 
duty in the Army. Today I'm having lunch with the football kicker from 
Syracuse University who wants to show me his bowl ring and an advance copy 
of the Syracuse football brochure for the coming season. Friday it's lunch 
with a young lady studying to be an English teacher at USF who wants me to 
meet her husband-to-be. Last week it was an e-mail from Qatar and a former 
student in the Air Force who once asked me if I'd like a tour of Air Force 
II and a chance to meet his boss--the Vice President of the United States!

I started to think of my experiences of just the past week in connection 
with a recent 60 Minutes II television program. The show examined a report 
by the Secret Service and the U.S. Department of Education. Their study 
involved interviews with students who have been responsible for a number of 
school shootings across the country. A profile has emerged of these school 
shooters. This school violence profile depicts a young person who is 
alienated from adults and peers, bullied by classmates, experienced a recent 
large scale sense of failure, revealed his feelings of anguish and rejection 
to another student, and one who has no significant adult who is desirous of 
listening to his plea for help. In essence, he is one who cannot cope and 
who perceives death as a better alternative to life. Safety in our schools 
must be our major concern. We must learn how to listen to the stress our 
students are experiencing and provide a caring ear and the hope they so 
desperately seek. As educators and parents, we are already a large part of 
our students' lives. It isn't really another responsibility on top of those 
we had before. It is a study of the environment in which kids exist and one 
we must understand in order to address their needs.

Yesterday I asked my former student now in the Army what he thought was the 
reason former students continue to stay in touch with me 10, 20, and more 
than 30 years later. "When I see an officer in the Army," he said, "I salute 
out of respect for his rank and his authority. Your students are saluting 
you because they and you remember the nicknames you gave them. You were 
saying, 'There isn't anyone now, nor has there ever been anyone as unique as 
you.' We felt important because you recognized our individuality; our 
opinions mattered; we could disagree, but we knew all along that if you said 
it, it was probably right. In short, you cared at a time when we sensed many 
others did not." Every teaching methods book should reflect the beliefs that 
each child is important; no student deserves to be bullied by another; 
teachers need to teach children first and subject matter second; and we must 
broaden the scope of our teacher training to include sensitivity to our 
students' feelings and create a school environment which is inviting and 
exciting for young learners.  Similarly, schools must be places of 
intellectual investigation which reward our teachers and not places in which 
they are asked to check their intellectual curiosity and sense of scientific 
inquiry at the front door. As a society, we must do more than pay lip 
service to the valuable role played by our teachers. Parents need to spend 
more time with their kids helping them to adjust to the complexities of the 
adult world.

Schools of stagnation and factory like relationships must give way to a new 
era of respect, true intellectual inquiry, and a renewed dedication to 
listening to our students. For every young person who causes trouble, there 
are 97 who are sincere, ready to learn and follow direction, and searching 
for a nickname to make them feel unique and a way to demonstrate their 
skills. The answers are there, and the outstanding kids have always been in 
place. Schools must be places of thought and not places of violence. It's a 
shame it took the Secret Service to show us the way, for there is no secret 
to unlocking the minds and hearts of our young people. In fact, those who 
are fourteen years old want the same respect, freedoms of expression, and 
recognition of individuality and talent enjoyed by those of us who would 
presume to be their teachers. While complex governmental studies tell us 
these incidents could occur anywhere, common sense tells us that violence 
and school shootings don't occur in places where there is love, respect, and 
understanding.

Of course, school budgets, class sizes, and test results are important. 
However, when it comes to an individual child, success may hinge on a 
moment's worth of attention or even something as small and unique as a 
nickname.

Subject: Need to ask a favor


Governor Bush:

I need to ask you a favor if I may. I don't know if
you can help me or not- but you don't know unless you
try. I was working for a citrus co-op until Dec 3rd
when the long term lender took over and terminated us
all the following morning. I was fortunate, because a
local business man ask me to come work for him in the
real-estate business. So, I went to school and got my
state license and started the middle of January. It
seems kind of odd not working in the agriculture field
even though 97% of their business is agricultural
land. Well, I've stayed with it for four months today
and not much is happening. With the economy the way it
is and so much agricultural land is old family land
and they really don't want to let it go. I was going
to ask you if you knew of any openings with the Dept.
of Agriculture. I would like to be out there making a
difference in the agriculture industry.

 A little of my background- I was raised in the citrus
industry and cattle. My family has been in Florida
agriculture for many generations. I have a degree in
Animal Science with a business minor from Berry
College in Rome, Ga. after graduation I moved to
Placedo, Texas and managed the 3X Ranch (oldest
Brahman Ranch in the US) for almost five years. I got
a little homesick not seeing my family but eight days
out of the year- that I moved back to Florida. I went
to work at the IFAS Range Cattle Station in Ona as the
Farm Adm. I remained there for five years and the
state kept telling me about a pay increase, but only
seemed to be able to change my title all the time. The
opportunity came and I went to work for Golden Gem
Growers (a grower owned citrus co-op) as a field rep.
I was responsible for fourteen counties in South and
Southwest Florida and some on the East Coast. I was
with them right at ten years, then the take over took
place and I walked away with nothing. I'm not giving
up on my new career, but it's hard when you are in the
second poorest county in the state, plus I miss my
full time agriculture work. I have been president of
our county Farm Bureau for the past seven years and
have been a big advocate of this industry all my life.
I truly know how important this industry is to our
state, being the second largest industry, but most of
all our life support system. I feel that Florida can
strive in our agriculture industry once again,
especially now that we have you. You are willing to
listen to our needs and our concerns, but most of all
willing to try and help our industry. We really need
to be pushing Florida Agriculture across the U.S. and
other countries. We grow and raise the highest quality
and safest product their is.

Also, being in the real estate business for a short
period of time, I have spent alot of time looking at
plat books. I didn't realize the state owned so much
land. I don't have a problem with this, but I do see
alot not being managed the way it should be. I didn't
know if the state had a land manager to over see the
other entities that managed the land (water districts,
mainly, wildlife land, ect.) I would like to see alot
of this land leased back to the farmer and rancher for
the tax role money. This way our state is still
receiving revenue off of it. Besides, who is going to
take better care of the land than someone in
agriculture, because they know the land is going to
take care of them. I really feel this plan is a win-
win for everybody. The state owns the land so it is
protected, you have the farmer/rancher taking care of
the land and placing the tax base loss back into the
state budget. It will work for everyone. Having
someone to over see this will more than pay for
itself.

I'm not sure what you can do for me if anything. Thank
you for your time and I appreciate you always willing
to listen to me and always responding. That means alot
to me and shows that you are concerned about the
people of Florida. If you need me to send a copy of my
resume to you, I will be glad to.

I used to be a CPO in the navy.  When we had a large project looming all the officers and chiefs and high-ranking civilians would scurry to anf fro making plans, ordering supplies and setting schedules.  I used to make it ahabit to run all the plans by the lower rated persons because that was where the rubber met the road.  They would ask questions like: "How are you going to get that 48 inch machine through the 38 inch door."  Seemingly small items that were lost in the big picture.


About 3 years ago you and I met in Indian Harbor Beach.  I was trying to relate problems at DCF.  You gave me your e-mail address and I tried to explain the situation at DCF over the next few weeks.  I had also told the big shots from Orlando about the problems - for that I was fired.

These 4500 missing children are just the tip of the iceberg. When I was a Protective Investigator I found that the job itself was very rewarding.  The problem was the middle and upper level management's near-sightedness, and the lack of employees.  I was only allowed the have 30 cases - I had almost 200 (and I was still in training).

24 people started off in my training class and 24 in the class after me.  Within a year virtually all of them were no longer with the department.  I would like to have stayed with the department, and would go back even now.  But the attitude of the middle management needs to change.

I'll tell you more if you care to hear.

Below is a letter from a friend who has sought my help in the past regarding her daughter. I would not bother you with it but for the fact that people knowledgible with Michelle's condition say she is doing very poorly at present because of inattention. 
 
I would not have written you with this except that her parents (who are wonderful people) have been told by a case worker that their daughter may die soon from lack of care. Hopefully, Michelle can be transferred closer to home where her family can assure that all her medical needs are met.

Honorable Jeb Bush
Governor of the State of Florida
 
This letter comes to you from the heart of a mother.  My daughter, Michelle Bolin, is a Florida State prison inmate.  She is a paraplegic.  This is a result of the traffic accident she caused.  She was convicted of DUI manslaughter and sentenced to 15 years in prison in 1997.  Because of extremely negligent medical care she is now serving a death sentence.
 
Michelle was married and had two little girls who are now 9 and 8.  Their father has custody of them and is doing a great job of raising and caring for them as a single father.
 
Michelle's problem was addiction to drugs.  She would drink alcohol to enhance the effects of the drugs.  This was her condition the day of the accident.
 
Michelle and I both know that justice must be served for her crime.  For that reason we are not asking for anything but reasonable and adequate medical care so that she might survive her sentence and come home.
 
Her major medical problems began in September of 1999 when she was transferred to Lowell Correctional Institute in Ocala, Florida.  While there, she has had to have surgery for a colostomy, a permanent catheter, and developed decubitus ulcers on her buttocks.  These ulcers developed because of pressure from sitting too long in her  wheelchair.  (Her chair is custom made for her).  Because of her medical problems she has to see the prison doctor almost daily.  She is forced to sit and wait for hours  to see the doctor for so much as an aspirin.  She has lain and sat in her own urine because her catheter leaks.  This causes further infection which leads to pseudomonas infection which causes death.
 
The staff at Lowell are unable to care for her medical needs and have contributed further to her problems with unsanitary practices.  They have at times not worn gloves when changing her dressings and, at times left some of the old packing in the wound.
 
Michelle has twice been transferred to North Florida Reception Center (NFRC), which is a men's prison with a hospital facility, because of her medical condition.  She is currently housed at NFRC with large decubitus ulcers on both sides of her buttocks.  She has now developed osteomilytis, a bone infection, and a hole in her intestines.
 
Michelle has had four surgeries to close these ulcers since 1999.  This current situation is the worst yet.  This ulcer developed while at Lowell early this year.  In February the plastic surgeon, Dr. Obie, told her it needed to be closed right away in order to prevent enlargement and infection.  At that time she still had enough good tissue on her buttocks to use for the procedure.  That is in doubt now.  The previous surgeries have used all of the available muscle tissue for a muscle flap procedure to close the sores.
 
The medical staff at Lowell was supposed to transfer her back to NFRC for this procedure in April but  there was always an excuse.  "The van broke down" is a favorite.  After 8 missed appointments, I called the Regional Director of impaired inmates, Dr. Diane Rechtine.  After hearing the problem, she immediately ordered an ambulance transfer to NFRC.  It is now May 16, and still nothing has been done.  The ulcers on her behind are now down to the bone.  A staff member called me, jeopardizing her job,  to tell me that Michelle is in very bad shape and even urged me to get an attorney.  The medical staff at NFRC said that Michelle has too many doctors involved in her case and cancelled the plastic surgeon, the very doctor she needs the most.  I don't understand this and no one will give me or Michelle any answers.
 
I have spoken with Mr. Emile Baudoin, Coordinator of impaired inmates, several times and he has assured me he would look into the problems but nothing changes.
 
Michelle's custom made wheelchair needed repairs in January.  She had to write a grievance to get the repairs and it still has not been repaired.  Her chair helps to relieve the pressure on her spine when sitting for prolonged periods.  The chair is still at Lowell.  It should have been fixed and transferred with her.
 
These problems just scratch the surface.  Michelle's medical records cover seven volumes.
 
Governor Bush, from one parent to another, I am asking for your help and or guidance to save my daughter's life.
 
There are only two women's prisons in Florida, Lantana in South Florida and Lowell in North Florida.  Can she possibly be transferred to some facility here in Northwest Florida such as a county jail or correctional facility?  There is no state prison for women in Nothwest Florida, but there is certainly a need for one.
 
I was told today that if someone does not help Michelle soon, she will die.  
 
I am not asking for Michelle's sentence to be reduced or for an early release.  I only ask that she be accorded the human and humane treatment that she has been refused.
 
Thank you for listening.

Friday Afternoon May 17, 2002

Dear Governor Bush,

I am writing to ask for your help in a serious matter
that needs your immediate attention.

In Miami, there is a community known as Miramar/Vista
Verte. In this community resides retirees, single moms
with numberous children, disabled citizens, emotional
and mentally handicapped and primarily low income
families. 

Miramar/Vista Verte is a community of townhouses, all
one story situated over several blocks. A total of 511
residences are located inside of this community. The
ethnic background of the majority of the residents of
this community is Hispanic. It is conviently located
next to the Florida Turnpike.

As relayed to me by my friend Tay here are the details
of what she has shared with me.

There has been an ongoing problem for years of outside
individuals trying to take control of the community
for apparent reasons of financial gain. A Homeowners
Association has taken control of this community and
made the residents LEGALLY subject unto them.

This Homeowners Association is contolled by a
management company. One if not both of the owners of
the homeowners association management company appear
to be attorneys licensed by the bar association.

The people of this community have not been able to
break away from the clutches of the Homeowners
Association that have taken control of their
community. None of the aggressors reside within the
community. Now 378 of the residences are being
foreclosed because of leins placed on their properties
in reference to the Homeowners Association. 

The people of this community NEVER agreed to having
this Homeowners Association in the first place. It has
been forced upon them. My friend Tay has never paid
the $35 per month homeowners fee assessed to her. She
can not afford to pay a homeowners association
anything. The small amount of money she has must be
spent on food, clothing, medicine, school for her
children, electricity, etc. It is wrong to force a
lien on her for a homeowners association that she
never agreed to. But that is exactly what has
happened. And the legal instruments have been filed by
the HOA to complete the job!

Last week I went to Miami to visit my friend. 

In looking into the faces of Tay's children (ranges 6
to 21) as I watched them work, do their homework and
constructively spending their time on the computer. I
ask myself? Where are these children going to live?
OMG They have the security of a home, food and shelter
here. What if their home is foreclosed on? What would
happen to them then? How would this affect their
lives?

They have no one to defend them. There is a church
involved in the foreclosures. The church has been
designated by the Miami Legal Services as "their
client", therefore there is a conflict of interest for
any representation.

My friend is subject to losing her home. When she
loses her home so will the six children whom all live
with her. She recently had surgery for the removal of
breast cancer. She need help!!! The people who own the
management company are filing the FINAL paperwork to
foreclose on her home, WRONGFULLY...Tay has boxes and
boxes of proof that will support the information that
I have shared with you.

Seems to me,,,that you being her Governor and my
Governor...and when all other sources for help have
been depeleted that it is time for you to step into
this matter to offer assistance and protection for her
and those others being WRONGFULLY foreclosed on in
this neighborhood. Please help my friend Governor
Bush,,,please help Tay, her 6 children and the other
residents of Miramar. They are citizens of Florida and
need you!!!

I ask you to please do the right thing in this case
and to send justice and peace to their community. Soon
they will be homeless if you do not help them based on
the time frame of all the legal paperwork that has
been filed with the courts.

I hope you will contact me.. ASAP..and that I can
direct you to my friend Tay in Miami...

May God Bless You and Be With You Always and as you
make the right decision in helping these defenseless
people.

Sincerely,

Sharon Hirschfield

Re: Veto House Bill 1307 

Dear Governor Bush; 

We met about four years ago at a Holiday Inn where you we presenting a speech to a disabled group. At that speech I asked you a question, "taken that if a bill was to come before you that eliminate accessibility would you sign it." You were offended for the question. It was not my intent to offend you, but to open your eyes up to that fact. After the meeting we spoke, but not of that issue. 

Well,  it appears that is exactly what is before you in House Bill 1307. I ask you to veto this bill and not let this bill go into law without your signature. 

Florida has always been the forefront to allow all our citizens in our great state,  to access buildings  and to be able work,  in all of our buildings in our great state. 

The law before you, has such a drastic negative impact that it will take those opportunities away. I know,  you are a strong believer in human rights and I know,  you would never intentionally hurt the civil rights of our disabled population, and for that,  was the reason I wanted you in office and voted for you, because I know,  you would,  and have protected  the rights of our disabled citizens and you do care. 

Another negative impact to this bill is relating to the  private inspection service which will be a  life safety concern to our citizens of our state. 


Please believe me, I am a great opponent for privatization. It's just the language in this bill that concerns me, It states that a private inspector, has to sign an affidavit to the best of his knowledge.   

As I am licensed building official, it has always been my responsibility by Florida Statue 468 to ensure ( guarantee) that the buildings I inspect have been built according to all the law's of Florida, not to the best of my knowledge. ( This is a negative impact and a life safety concern). An example of this; I may have gotten my license when the law just came into effect and have obtained my minimum requirements of 16 hours of continuing education every two years. This does not mean I am aware of the many changes that occur to our statues as currently required. ( Ensure ( guarantee)). I can just sign the affidavit and the Building Official has to accept it. This in my opinion is a life safety concern. 

Attached find a letter from the Broward County Board of Rules and Appeals addressing this bill from another aspect. 

The letter speaks from the point of home rule. Even though this would be a statue, not all the counties in the state would be required to adhere to it. If in fact it was equal to the language in Florida Statue 468, then perhaps it would be adopted by the local counties administrate chapters of the new Florida Building Code. , which would make it a positive impact. 

For the above reasons I ask you to veto HB 1307 and do not allow this bill to become law without your signature. 

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions. 

Sincerely: 
Thomas J. Ricci CBO

Governor:

Attached is a file containing the FEFP funding increases for you 1st term in
office.  Pay attention to the 1st two tabs.  The "Historical Bush" tab has
increases by district, 1st three and 1st four years.  The first three years
are provided FYI.  What I see as the most powerful message is the
relationship between the percentage increase in funds compared to the
perecentage increase in students.  For instance, in your 1st term, statewide
K-12 enrollment grew by 10.4% while statewide total funding grew by a
whopping 27.1%.  Take the same comparison for a specific district....Duval
enrollment grew by 1.3% while total funding grew by 14.5%.  The other tab
has some comparison data that you might interest you.

Let me know if you have any questions on this info.  I look forward to a
very successful Bush/Brogan re-election campaign!

Subject: Home owner foreclosures by Home Owners Associations


	I have been reading about people across Florida losing their homes --
including one tragic story in Ocala two years ago -- because property owners
have failed to pay Home Owners Association dues -- for whatever reason.
This is obviously getting to be a major problem. I understand there are
about 378 such foreclosures pending now, and I am told 12 sales on the
courthouse steps today in various counties.
	Admittedly, all or certainly most of these property owners have had notice
from their associations.  In some cases, particularly with older people,
there may be real troublesome cases where widows (or widowers for that
matter) simply do not understand what they are getting in the mail.
Sometimes it is just stubbornness.

	Every problem ahs a solution if we will but seek it out. As a solution that
I believe is worth considering, and I believe would be a good issue for you
to solve the problem with is to:

	Propose to the legislature a different way of handling the matter. 	If
property owners assessments were handled like unpaid property taxes . . . a
certificate sold this year, another certificate sold next year and then a
court ordered foreclosure with proper advertising, notice etc AFTER the two
certificates . . . the chances of a real tragic case slipping through the
cracks would be lessened considerably.

	I am not a lawyer and do not know just how to make it work, and I am sure
the homeowners association lobbyists will object . . . but government can do
anything it wants to solve real or imagined problems.  This is an issue that
is embarrassing to every public official when questions arise.  In a case
here two years ago, Ed Dean, an attorney who was named Sheriff late in the
Chiles administration to replace a popular sheriff who stole county money,
had his own old law firm buying a widow's house during his campaign.
Fortunately, we were able to get it worked out for the time being, and the
lady got her house back but later was declared incompetent when it was about
to go to be sold again . . . but a delay process such as I suggest might
really help the situation.

	I am going to propose this to Dennis Baxley and Rod Smith too.  I hope you
will get your people to figure out a way to make it work, and let's solve a
real problem.
	And thanks for being our Governor!!!

School on May 14th


Dear Governor Bush,
    During your visit to Wimauma Elementary School in Hillsborough County 
today, May 14th, you asked Betty Womack, their math specialist, to have the 
author of the math centers series that she uses to contact you.  I have to 
admit that I am the author.  

I originally wrote them for my classroom students in grades 3-5 to support my 
math instruction.  My students never remembered the concepts that they needed 
to know since most math series allocate one chapter per concept resulting in 
students only practicing the concept for a short period.  This lack of 
repetition results in students not retaining most of the concepts for a full 
year.  During 20+ years of teaching I realized that my students struggled in 
16 areas of math.  I developed sequential centers in each area with a 
question or two per day for the students to maintain their skill, practice 
the concept, and have fun doing it.  I also employed material that students 
would see and use in the outside world.  For example, they learned time with 
TV, movie, amusement park and tide schedules; perimeter and area used 
architectural plans; temperature used newspapers like weather maps; weight & 
mass weighed everyday items like cans of beans; etc.  

I wrote the centers to compliment any math program in use.  My ideal math 
lesson involved a 45 minute-session of the standard curriculum math and then 
my students would actively participate in each of the 16 centers for an 
additional 30 minutes four days per week.  I used the fifth day of each week 
for active math involvement activities.  Children enjoy these centers 
immensely and at the same time were meeting and exceeding FCAT standards.  I 
am happy to report that a large number of schools in Florida are using the 
centers with great success.  I will gladly provide you their names at your 
request.  Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Best of luck in your re-election bid!  Go Jeb!

Subject: State Farm request to increase rates

Lorna Noren

Lorna,

Please consider me an intervener in the State Farm request for a rate
increase. Their motivation to increase Florida rates is driven from 2
causes. 

First, they have invested poorly creating a $1.2 Billion corporate loss.
This is not due to claims or natural disasters, but due primarily to
poor investment decisions at State Farm corporate.

Secondly, their internal processes are unbelievably inefficient and
incredibly difficult for customers to understand and utilize. As a 42
year customer who changed from State Farm this year, I have first hand
recent experience of just how incredibly poorly they manage claims and
billing. 

They have used their losses due to poor investment strategies to
consumer disadvantage and should not be allowed to increase rates
because of poor management. The state should not be a party to allowing
poorly managed companies to gouge consumers who are already
disadvantaged from home damage.

Mssrs. Diez and Lawhun,

Please ensure that Mr. Feeney ,Mr. Constantine, and Mr. Gallagher are
personally aware that this action is a thinly veiled consumer gouging
act (in an election year) by a company that does not deserve their
support.
If elected officials will only pause for staff to research the basis for
corporate losses, I think the case for a rate increase will come
crashing down.

Many investors have lost ground in the past 12 months but are not
seeking support from the state to recover losses from consumers.

Mr. Miller: 
 
As you may know, Florida requires companies to submit their rates to the
Department of Insurance and justify the need for any increase.  The
Department reviews these rates to ensure that they are not excessive or
unfairly discriminatory.  However, Florida Law permits rate increases if
they can be justified so the company can continue to provide benefits
under their policies.

We will pass your comments on to the area that reviews the request for
increases.  Some of the information they look at is the loss experience
versus premiums paid plus operating expenses.  

Thank you for taking the time to let us know your thoughts.

Subject: How do I comment on State Farm request to increase rates


Webmaster,
Please forward this to appropriate entities in State Government
responsible for approving State Farm's request for a rate increase.
It's my belief that State Farm Florida is a poorly managed enterprise. I
was a customer for 42 years. They can manage their customer base more
effectively, not more expensively.
The rate increase is simply compensation for State Farm's failure to
serve its customer base. My final 2 experiences cost State Farm a
substantial amount (internal administrative expense) and left me
dissatisfied enough to change companies after 42 years. The unusual
process for handling claims is foreign to customers but well understood
and manipulated by State Farm to the significant disadvantage of
taxpayers.
Giving them a rate increase without demanding improvements in service
and performance is simply giving them a governmental approval to
continue to be ineffective.

After much discussion with fellow teachers this past week about your visit, I was chosen to ask why the FCAT standards/expectations were not introduced to all students entering the first grade in such and such a year and thus implemented over 12 consecutive years while being monitored on a yearly basis, making adjustments to the curricula and calendar as needed?  It seems to us that this would have reduced the failure rate, the stress level and the accountability concerns as every teacher, student and school would have the necessary time to work towards those standards.  We don't think there is an educator out there who doesn't believe in the FCAT but rather is more concerned with how it has been implemented ...."the cart before the horse"...so to speak.

Honorable Governor Bush.
 
Due to the urgency of this matter I feel you must act now.  This is in reference to the issue of dozens of low-income families, most of them single mothers, handicap people, and minorities being foreclosed at Miramar Gardens and Vista Verde. with all due respect, what is happening here is not inline with good governmental  policies, much less with State or US HUD policies. These families are being put out in the street with minor children, yet no official  have taken the lead to try to get to the bottom of this strange situation, although, the majority of these families are registered voters and the poor votes also counts.
 
The information that I got from someone who has been a homeowner there for 26 years, is that this is a low-income community, some of this families have been living there for 30 years, at the beginning, there was never a HOA, everyone maintained their own adjacent common areas near each unit, I single mother that I got to talk to claims that 26 years ago when she bought this unit there was no HOA, years went by and all of the sudden some strange happened. an association was imposed on them, then a receivership making mega thousands of dollars a year, and then a management company by force not by vote. I had the opportunity to see pictures of this neighborhood, although they are been force to pay a high tab, the common areas maintenance leaves a lot to be desired, now obviously people perceive that the management company imposed on them is not doing the job and is just charging for work not done, and I can see why, there is no even live grass, yet according to the homeowner, management paid for such regularly. There is another theory, that unscrupulous people are behind this situation trying to foreclose of these people in order to take control of the land. My understanding is that this community consist of over 500 townhomes, lots of families to be thrown to the streets. I wonder what is the real role of our government, help this hopeless families, just let these sharks eat them alive, or try to look for a positive and painless way of bringing the community back to where it was and protect these families and handicap people. US HUD and State of Florida spends millions of dollars every year from our tax dollars in order to provide  low-income housing, yet what is happening here is in very conflict with the policies. US HUD spent trillions on subsidy rents, and homeownership, so there is all types of programs, what is it in this case than apparently no positive approach has been taken??.  Do you feel someone should loose their homestead for a few hundred dollars or don't you think that arrangement could have been made to solve this situation. I was provided with documentation than reveals the manager and the foreclosing attorney are principals in a corporation with 50% interest each. Once again, I suggest that this case is worth a few hours of FDLE investigation since now with this imposed association the community is regulated by state laws. For all these reasons, I previously respectfully requested from you that something needs to be done at state level and you have the power of issuing an executive order to protect not only these families but all Floridians who live in regulated properties. I just got another e-mail today describing a newspaper article with another foreclosure in Orlando for $161.00, what's going on? For now, thru a network of good Samaritan, news organizations, community organization and others, I will continue to keep track of all these cases for future reference, as I Informed you before, prominent pro-Hispanics organizations will be raising these issues soon.

Jeb

This Thursday my wife and I attended a friends sons HS graduation at one
of
the local schools.  There was a small group of slightly rowdy young
adults
sitting behind us--it appeared that they likely graduated ( or dropped
out)
themselves in the last year or so.  As the graduates were called
alphabetically, one member of the group behind us ask his friend  "what
comes after the letter "O""?  My wife and I just looked at each other in
disbelief and groaned at the same time.  If we hadn't heard this
ourselves
we probably wouldn't have believed it :-(


Just one more reason for you to stick to your guns with strict
accountability---don't relent!   I'm proud of the fact that you are
passionate and committed to improving our Florida education system.  I
hear
lots of complaints but no solutions that make sense but what you and Mr.
Brogan are working towards.  The Florida Today is supposed to have a big
piece on ed. funding Sunday--I am sure it will be a very up beat,
positive,
unbiased and compassionate piece.  ha!

Take care

Subject: DCFS - PLEASE Take The Time To Read


Gov. Bush,                                               

     As a former foster "mommy" to over 200 children and presently a
Citizen Review Panel member for the 10th Judicial Circuit in Polk County
(Florida), I am extremely concerned and interested in the problems that
are occurring (and have been for years) within DCFS.                    

     I know that since at least 1989, our former Governor's have also
formed numerous panels/committee's to look into DCFS and their problems.
This is an excellent idea. However, I feel that if you want to find out
what is REALLY going on within the "system" that you need to talk with
the people that have "been in the trenches" and know first hand what is
truly going on. It does very little good to just talk to and question
the "higher ups" within DCFS - talk to the people that have lived within
and deal directly with DCFS - this is where you will find out the true
story and hopefully ways to help.               

     I am not writing you to "bash" DCFS. They have some wonderful
people working there; a horrific and impossible job to do; and no, I
would not do their job for ANY amount of money. Speaking of money, yes,
that is an issue. Unfortunately though, money is not going to, by
itself, solve all of the problems that they are facing. More monies seem
to be allocated every time there is a major crisis that makes the news,
and new "rules and/or laws" are made. However, NOTHING really changes.                         

    As a member of the Citizen Review Panel, let me give you a few
examples of the problems I have seen (money has very little to do with
what I am sharing with you). These situations are nothing but
irresponsibility on the part of DCFS.     
1. We heard a case where the children were left in the home under
Protective Services. When we got to court for the hearing we found out
that the case had been CLOSED because "the family had moved and the
caseworker did not know where they were". Of course, nobody bothered to
check to see if Dad was still employed at the mines where he had worked
for many year or checked with the Police Dept. (very small town) to see
if they might know where they were. They did not check with the schools
to see if the children were still enrolled!!!!!!! When the DCFS Attorney
was questioned (caseworker was not at hearing) her comment was something
to the effect that "they figured the children were OK since there had
been no recent reports to the child abuse hotline". Of course, my remark
to her was that the next call to the hotline might be in reference to
the death of a child!!!!                                              
2. We heard another case in which the Mom had placed her child with a
friend before DCFS became involved. Later DCFS was called in and they
the baby in the home where the Mom had placed him. That was probably
fine - BUT, DCFS NEVER did a home study or background check on anyone
living in that home as required. I believe this child had been in the
friend's home for about a year by the time we heard the case (I can
verify the time frame if needed).                               
3. We saw children with severe behavioral problems being returned home
because "there was no place to put them". One child in particular had
been in every therapeutic home available and none of them would take him
again - so he was just returned home only to have to be returned to the
"system" again. Thankfully nothing serious (that we know of) happened to
him during the time he was back home.                                               
4. We saw children returned home with no order from the judge.                                 
5. DCFS workers would come into our hearings and have absolutely NO CLUE
as to what was going on in the case. We would be presented with a copy
of the Judicial Review which looked exactly like the Judicial Review we
had for that case a few months earlier - the ONLY changes on it would be
the date. These Judicial Reviews usually included "no new law violations
known." Of course, when questioned about any recent law violations they
never knew - they had not checked prior to coming into court or
preparing the Judicial Review. I finally started checking for new
violations myself the night before the hearing (on my computer) and
frequently found new violations and/or found out that a parent was
currently in jail.                                  
6. We had numerous cases in which 
DCFS had NOT done criminal background checks on adults living in the
home where the child was placed (either relative placement of friend).                                 
7. We had numerous cases where the caseworker had not done what the
judge had ordered after our previous hearing on that particular case.
They also had not followed through on the panels recommendation as they
had agreed to.   


8. I know of situations where DCFS has gone to the home in reference to
a hotline report, and when they find the parents not home (or they just
don't come to the door) DCFS will leave a note for the parent to call
them. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that if there is
a child in the home covered with bruises or the home is extremely
filthy, these parents are NOT going to call DCFS to come back and take a
look!!!!!!!!!                                              
9. I also know of cases where the children are in the home under
Protective Supervision and when the caseworker goes to the home the
parents say the child is sleeping; is at a neighbor's; etc. The
caseworker does not INSIST on seeing that child - they just report that
they made a visit. That is a big RED FLAG WARNING when this occurs; yet
it happens time after time.                            
10. Then you have the problem of judges returning children home AGAINST
the advice of DCFS. This is a another issue, and is certainly not the
fault of DCFS.        

     These are a few of the reasons WHY CHILDREN ARE DYING UNDER DCFS
SUPERVISION!!!!!!!! Please take the time to listen to some of the people
that are, or have been, involved "behind the scene".     

     If you, or any of your staff would like to take the time to discuss
this situation, I would be more than happy to help. I feel quite sure
that I could even get a small group of other Citizen Review Panel
members and foster parents to discuss these issues. I am willing to go
anywhere at anytime in reference to this. I am not looking for publicity
- I do not want publicity. I only want to see changes TRULY implemented
and adhered to for the safety of our children.                          

     I know this is lengthy, and for that I apologize. Thank you though
for taking the time to read this and I am sincere in my desire to help.                                     

    I gave up my foster care (Emergency Shelter Home) license after the
tragic case of Bradley McGee. Yes, he was one of "my" babies, and after
his death I just could not allow myself to go through the pain of taking
care of and loving these children, only to have NO SAY in what was in
"the child's best interest". Braddie lived with my family until he was
moved into his "long term" foster home. His death was truly horrific and
we hoped that because of his death, the system would change.
Unfortunately that did not happen, but I am still prayerful that it
will.  

     Please contact me at any time if I can help with the issues of
making DCFS more effective in protecting our children.    

Thank you.

Subject: Foster care system


Dear Gov,
    As a former guardian ad litem and foster parent, I suggest the
following:
1.  One reason there are not more good foster homes is that in order to
foster properly every child in the home must have the same opportunity.
That means in all but the poorest homes, the existing children have to
forgo opportunity to allow the foster children to have some.  This is
because the foster care reimbursement is insufficient (when was the last
time you clothed a child for a year on $200?, much less the other
requirements).
2.  The system spends far too much time investigating complaints that
are false, diverting precious resources from situations that need
attention.  Even professional reports, and self-reports cannot be
counted on to be valid.   We ought to pay for education compaigns for
what parents are expected to do (if you are not feeding, sheltering,
speaking kindly to, loving, teaching your children right from wrong,
demonstrating good work ethic, making sure they get to school clean and
neatly dressed, and know where and with whom they are, you need to fix
it or let someone raise your children who will.  If you are calling your
children derogatory names, hitting them, pulling their hair, hurting or
humiliating them, losing your temper in front of them, letting them
disobey the laws or behave badly without consequence, exposing them to
sex or violence, or leaving them to to their own devices, you must
either quit or let someone raise your children who will.)
3.  The law that forces reporting of child on child sexual abuse cases
by counselors, even when there is no reason to suspect any parental
involvement forces parents who want to protect their children from
public knowledge of the problem, cannot get counseling for them.  Isn't
the best case that children who are victims or perpetrators of sexual
abuse get therapy?  Then why have a reporting system that (1)
discourages it; and (2) must spend lots of time and energy on cases
which do not offer any additional protection to the public or the child.

4.  Although I am not persuaded this is a government function, I would
love to see powerful leaders give a serious of talks in which they
acknowledge that personal choice aside, part of the reason why child on
child and other sexual abuse is increasing is that pornography is too
available, clothes are too skimpy, advertisements are too sexual, movies
are too raunchy; lyrics are too graphic.  If we really want to keep our
children safe, we must voluntarily curtail these influences.
5.  Why don't you issue a Executive Order designating one day a week as
family night?  Discourage any scheduled meetings or activities on that
night.  Turn out the lights in state buildings for all except critical
workers.  Ask cities and counties to join you in the effort.  Encourage
families to spend that one night together.    You are right,
strengthening families will be far most cost effective than anything
government can do AFTER families get in trouble.

Subject:	Threat on Water Supply in Orlando

We received a general threat against the "drinking water system" for Orlando.  The Orlando Regional Domestic Security Task Force received this  information in the early morning hours today via the FBI.  The source of the threat originated in Germany via the internet through French Yahoo to the CIA Bulletin Board.
 
Efforts have been completed to take necessary precautions for the 30 water supply sources in Orange County (28 of which are routinely unmanned). All managers of these operations have been contacted and local law enforcement are currently manning all locations and will until further notice.
 
At this point, no real specifics to the threat and no identification of the source.  The FBI, who is a member of our DSTF, is working this angle.
 
Local gov't officials who need to know have been briefed, and i talked to David Struhs earlier this morning as  a heads up.
 
Will keep you informed on meaningful developments.

Subject:	RE: Florida Today-A Special Report

You are welcome.

As I was reading some of these articles on funding--IE: the discrepancy gaps such as who is willing to pay more as opposed to those who believe education is under funded.  May I suggest that we create a special state education fund where anyone can donate to for education by specific category: Scholarships, Teacher Pay (perhaps for increased performance), Facilities, Special Programs, to Specific school etc.  Under current federal tax law, it would be considered a charitable contribution and deductible.  Local groups, businesses, teachers unions or individuals could raise or provide funds etc and target for whatever they consider a need.  I realize there is nothing in current tax laws to prevent anyone from donating now to any school or schools foundation now, however I am not aware of a specific funding mechanism managed by the state for the specific purpose which would allow individuals or groups to target specific categories as opposed to dollars going into a general fund where who knows where it goes.  Provisions should also be made that no educational dollars could be supplanted as has been the case with the lottery.  This may also provide a means to for all of those people (72% in the Florida Today survey) who believe education is woefully under funded, to put their money where their mouth is!!  Just a thought.

Also in reading the state stats on graduation rates this morning--it would be interesting to see if all Florida districts use the same formulas and data aggregation for determining graduation and dropout rates.  This topic has always deeply concerned me that any district in the US manipulate stats to show how great they are doing when in fact the students are not truly receiving the services that the public is led to believe.  I am asking because I don't know--do we have extremely rigid formulas in Florida that districts MUST use to calculate dropout and also graduation rates for consistency district to district and consequently state to state?  If so, do we have any follow up teams to verify stats and how the data for the stats were aggregated? This accuracy and consistency of this info is vital in deterring and evaluating the services we are providing our kids.

An update on our electronic course career, college, scholarship planning and registration program. We have taken the planning request forms from High School/High Tech pilot students this past week--and as soon as our data entry clerk completes entering the program of study data we will make a run of the student worksheets in preparation to work with the pilot group students when they return in the fall to personalize their HS courses based on their college, career and scholarship plans. Remember--undecided is OK--clueless is not! :-)  62% of Florida 9th graders do not graduate HS and we are ranked 47th in education---I absolutely believe these revised guidance procedures and use of these new tech tools can make a dramatic change for Florida students and have committed myself to making this work! Every Florida Student and parent needs to be aware of every opportunity available to them and have the ability to adequately plan and prepare for them.  Thanks to your e-mail to Mr. Horne last month, some of his staff folks have e-mailed and called--we are now trying to put together a date for some of them to come over this summer.  Everything we are putting together has been done with it in mind so it is easily replicated and used in order to get into the hands of schools and kids as easily and quickly as possible.  

Have a good day--and its been raining hard here today--boy did we need that!!  Looks like most of the state is getting some good rain--finally.

Dear Adam Putnam,
  I met you with my husband at the Tampa VA Hospital.  
You may also remember me from the City Hall Meeting in Lakeland about the aeral spraying of the met fly.
 I love & look out for our Veterans & have seen far too much waiting & suffering on the part of the Veteran.
** My husband is a perfect example. He is 100% P&T from PTSD & 60% stomach Disorders due to Agent Orange exposure.
 He has been going to the Tampa VA for nealy 10 years. 99% of the time was because he had problems, bad ones with his stomach. The primary sends you to a specialist (that if your lucky) , you may see in 3 months.The specialist orders tests & see's you again, in say 3 months.Then you see the primary Dr. every 6 months to a years to find out results.
   I know because recently my husband has been seen on an emergency basis, given a prescriptions of anti-biotics & sent home, maybe 4 times in the past 3 months. April 3rd he sat 5 hours in Lakeland Emergency Room waiting to bee seen by a Dr. 
The Tampa VA was too far to drive with his pain. After being told he had a 2 to 4 hour more of a wait he left LRMC & headed for the Tampa VA, got as far as HWY 301 & went to Pasco Hospital in Dade City. It took 15 minutes before  Dr.Hashmi there saw him, ordered a shot & 1 test. One simple non- invasive test to find what the problem had been for years of tests  at the VA! 
He had 14 inches of his colon, small intestine & appendix removed. And there was a carcinoid tumor hiding in side the appendix. 
 
     I too just has surgery at the Tampa VA. After surgery I was put in a private room , waited 35 minutes for a nurse to respond while vomiting, in pain & it took the nurse an additional 45 minutes to return with a large blue bowl and a towel. She then left me soiled & exited the room. It was reported to the Head of Nurses but the point is there are too few caring Dr.'s & caring nurses, & far less life saving machines for testing & techs to properly do the testing. Mistakes are made I agree, but I think better care & concern  at the Tampa VA needs your looking into. Our Veterans have been there for us . "WE THE PEOPLE" are asking more service men to help now with terrioism, but if our goverment can't take care of these veterans, find & fix the problems of our men & women they will die. The outer grounds, ponds with fish & the plants , flowers & streams are beautiful, but I think more equiptment, more help is what our Veterans need most. I nearly lost my husband from being mis-diagonsised,wrong testing,& wrong medicine was given.It saddens my heart to see things like this happen . This is the USA.... Should we not come first ? Do our Veterans not deserve the very BEST for their sacrifices? I am cc: this letter to "Gov. Jeb Bush" as well as I know this needs to be addressed in every "Veterans Hospital". Thank you for your time & interest in this matter.

Dear Governor,

I am hesitant to bother you at this busy time in your career; however, 

here in Citrus County we have a true "Gem" that you should be aware of, 

and appoint to the Florida Corrections Commission. Dr. Schembri has 

lived in Citrus county for about three years, but he is by far the most 

qualified person probably in the entire State that you could appoint to 

the Florida Corrections Commission and I can assure you that if you do 

appoint him you will never regret it. I personally guarantee him and 

vouch for him in all respects. I have come to know Dr, Schembri very 

well, he is an outstanding individual and he has the the very strong 

endorsement of Nancy Argenziano, State Committeeman Ken Chadwick, State 

Committeewoman Debra Fredrick and my fellow Bush co-Chair Sam Lyons.



Listed below are some salient bullet points regarding Dr. Schembri:



 a.

. Former Correction Commissioner, New York City reduced violence 24% 

and overtime 33%.

 

b.. Former Police Commissioner Westchester New York, UN Representative 

International Association of Chiefs of              Police.

Dear Governor Bush:

You might want to look at this twelve page article [hyperlinked below] contained in today's paper regarding education.  It apparently will be in three sections.   The reporter I would deal with, If I were you, is Jeff Schweers, should you be so inclined.  http://www.floridatoday.com/!NEWSROOM/special/education/indexeducate.htm  I   think I picked up two more teachers who support you and are willing to go on air/print to do so.  They will let me know within the next few weeks.

FYI, I lost my appeal at the Fifth DCA. on the April 29, 2002. I'm filing a Motion for Rehearing En Banc and asking the question be certified to the Supreme Court.  It is a long shot, but nothing ventured-nothing gained.  http://www.5dca.org/Opinions/OpinionFrameset.htm

am e-mailing it to you.

#2 - My 25 year old daughter Jamie just informed me last evening that
she is in the same court drug program as your daughter. She lives in
Evansville, In. I had know idea that she was heavily involved in drugs.
When I told her that Mary Beth and I would be seeing you this weekend, I
told her that I would pass along to you our best wishes and continue
good health for your daughter. Perhaps, when you have time in your busy
life, you could e-mail to Jamie some words of encouragement? Thanks. See

We have not had a chance to talk about the bill--we provided a quick overview in the notebook we sent to you last friday.  I wanted to make sure you know that it contains about $30m in trust fund transfers, HR outsourcing language, CLEPing language that we requested, and language that puts us, the house and senate in charge of the redistricting certification process, and allows each of us to contract for legal services. 

Legal is still reviewing  the bill and may find issues, but we were able to remove/change much of the egregious language (the LG and Charles fixed the language on PSA's). The only item that remains that does not really modify an appropriation is the Hialeah language that allows the track to not pay taxes on handle for days it did not run. I am sure you know why I could not get this out of the bill!! 

I will speak to Charles, but you may want to ask him as well, if we need to sign the bill quickly because of the certification language...yes, I said sign :-)

Greetings Governor Bush,
 
I wanted to send you an email asking for your support  on the CS/SB 160 bill.  Derby Lane  over the years has contributed many dollars to local charities and foundations . I hope that you will give  this biill your approval. Both myself and my husband  are strong supporters of all the Bushes. We voted for you  as our Governor, your brother for President, and your Father before him. We will be voting again for your reelection. My husband who is employed with the local police department served proudly under your fathers command during the Gulf War. We are not avid gamblers, but have attended many fund raisers sponsored by Derby Lane. They have done so much for the community. Much of the funds that have come from Derby Lane has helped support our local Police Athletic League. These funds helped give opportunities to the youths of St.Petersburg through crime prevention programs. Mr. Bush, Thanks for your time, and Thanks for being a real PAL to our youths. Carol Manning

Dear Governor Bush:
 
 
 
I need your assistance in a very important matter. As you know Orange County Public Schools and Cyber High  Charter of Orange County have been in a dispute over transportation costs and the withholding of state funds from the school. The reason I am writing is that I went to pick up our FTE and capital outlay check today as well as a grant check and I was told we don't have  any for Cyber. I then called Jason Powell, the charter school coordinator and he indicated there was an e-mail that Dr. Boekhoff sent me in regards to withholding these funds because of our landlord that has an assignment with the court. First of all we should have received some money. We are still operating and have one more week of school. We have teachers to pay. They are withholding our operating funds.
Please see what you can do to get these funds released immediately.
Parents are very upset. We have a majority of hispanic and black students at our school. On behalf of Cyber High, we would appreciate assistance in this matter.     
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Leona Rachman

Dear Governor Bush,

I am writing to ask that Susan Dickerson by appointed as permanent Director
of Developmental Disabilities.  She is very competent and very caring.  She
knows our disability community, and she knows our Florida political
dynamics.  She is caring, responsive, and dialogical.

To bring someone in from outside Florida or outside the system would, I
believe, set us back.

I am grateful for your commitment to persons with disabilities and their
families.  thank you for all you have done for us--

Subject: Apology and explanation


Dear Governor, My friends tell me that I have been a little hard on you - 
perhaps more critical than I should be in view of my not having explained 
fully why I think Gul Cumber would be a bad choice as a Commissioner on the 
North Broward Hospital Board.If you think so too, I apologize.
First of all, I believe that she falsified an important fact on her 
application, and I think that is grounds for being disqualified. I was told 
by someone who is, to me, an unimpeachable source, that she works for Jim 
Blosser. I am told that she said that she works for W.H Cumber and Company. 
That Company does not have a listing in the Fort Lauderdale, Miami, Pompano, 
or Deerfield Beach phone books. I had to get the number from a telephone 
supervisor after the regular information operator could not find it. In view 
of what our country has been subjected to lately, it bothered me a great deal.
Jim Blosser is part of a group in Broward County that includes Bill Scherer. 
They believe in absolute rule of the group, to the exclusion of anything that 
even resembles a democracy. Not too long ago, Blosser tried to prevent an 
80-year-old citizen by the name of Bob Koenig, from entering the County 
Commission chambers. He didn't want him to testify against the project that 
Blosser was supporting, and was very nasty about it. That is not the way our 
government is supposed to work.

As I have said before, I believe that nothing is more important to Bill 
Scherer than staying on as the attorney to the North Broward Hospital 
District. It is a multi-million dollar contract. I have explained to you how 
the Cambridge mess came to be - for the personal, political and financial 
gain of Bill Scherer. But it is out-and out fraud, theft of the public's 
money, theft of a doctor's equipment, instruments, his patients, in fact his 
life, and the source of enormous lack of respect for the Republican Party 
here as a result of it. They should be building you up, not tearing you down. 
By their actions, they are going back to the old Forman regime. (I am aware 
that the Formans were big supporters of you, but I believe that in the end, 
come next November, you will find that their support was a huge benefit to 
them, and a huge detriment to you.) As an example, I remember when a contract 
for a doctor by the name of Ivan Lavernia for eighty million dollrs to do all 
the indigent care in the District's bailiwick was being pushed by that group. 
He was no more qualified to do that than I am. Fortunately, the new Board 
(1993) stopped it.The expression "birds of a feather flock together" is 
flying around all over the place, and it isn't good for you or the Party in 
general.

Hamilton Forman has a personal dislike of Tim Bailey's father because he 
stopped Forman from continuing to do what Pat Bailey called "intimidating the 
Board" when
Pat Bailey sat on the Board as a Martinez appointee. I would appreciate it 
very much if you would prevent the plundering of the District by Forman and 
his clique, which includes Scherer, by appointing Tim Bailey. Sincerely, Jane 
Kreimer

Dear Governor Bush: 

      Enjoyed seeing and hearing you (and the First Lady) again during this fourth C.A.F.E.  It is always enjoyable and inspiring when a Governor pays attention to those who are less fortunate than others.  It is a real thrill for our developmentally disabled consumers and families to meet you.  Thank you for coming!   

      My son, Mark, and his roommate, Eddie, asked me to say "Hello" to you but I was unable to get close enough.  So I am passing along their greetings and best wishes to you now. 

      The C.A.F.E. is always well run and so informative.  Even we regulars learn a thing or two!  Glad to see so many new faces there and sorry that so many were turned away.  It's a wonderful annual event. 

Best Wishes,

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I wish you would try harder to get that money back. $10,000 helps her kill a lot of babies. 
 
I am willing to help you get it back if for no other reason than to help you with your upcoming campaign. Could you tell me how I would go about getting a copy of the cashed check (both sides) you sent her and a copy of the letter you sent demanding that she return the money?
 
If she cashed a check made out to "Crisis Pregnancy Center of Central Florida," she did it fraudulently because there is no such corporate name in Florida.
 
This is a wrong that needs to be corrected.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I wrote an article for my web site about the tactics used by an abortion clinic owner that resulted in you giving her $10,000 in left over campaign funds thinking she was a Crisis Pregnancy Center. The article is at  <http://forerunner.com/fyi/news/fyi051302.htm> http://forerunner.com/fyi/news/fyi051302.htm I plan to let people know it's there on Monday. 
 
I have not read anything about whether or not she ever gave the money back. If you can tell me one way or the other, I will include it in the article. If she cashed the check, she probably did it fraudulently because there is no "Crisis Pregnancy Center of Central Florida" listed at the Dept of State, Division of Corporations web site.

Dear Governor Bush,

I am placing this information into your care with a
prayer that you  will keep it safe/protected.

Here is the name, address and telephone number of my
friend that is one of the residents/homeowner victims
of the foreclosues in Miramar/Vista Verde. She can
direct your chief legal counsel to others in the
neighborhood.

She too retains an abundance of evidence in this
matter.

Name:Taimira Perez  Nickname: Tay pronounced "Ti"
21459 NW 40th Cir Ct
Miami, Fl. 33055 

1-305-626-3842 
  
She and those who live in Vista Verde are very scared
of speaking to almost anyone in reference to this
matter. They have been emotionally, physically,
financially and spiritually harmed.They have been in a
fierce battle.

After the review of your legal counsel and his
briefing to you, I am sure you will understand what a
monster this is...

I visited my friend Tay in Miami this afternoon. I
bought and took she and her family a cake. It had the
American Flag with an Eagle drawn onto the cake. I
told her that the cake represented the renewal of
"hope" and of the "American dream of freedom and
democracy in our county". She came to this country
from Cuba...to escape Communism and Castro.

I also took 2 inch binders and plastic sheets with me
to help her in organizing the materials of evidence.
This is so that it will be ready when your chief
counsel contacts her.

Again I can not begin to thank you enough for giving
this matter your immediate attention...

If you saw the faces of those who are getting their
homes foreclosed (another victim I saw today, 82 year
old Hispanic woman that can not read the English legal
documents that have been served on her)  immediately
you would know that what is going on is wrong...then
when you begin to look at the evidence and hear the
testimonies of other victims, you ask "how could this
have ever happened"? it makes you want to shed tears,
it makes you want to help, to do whatever within your
power that legally can be done to stop it...

It is possible that a "cult" is involved in this..one
resident testified today to me that she visited the
church and they were praying to "mother earth". It
needs to be researched and determined exactly what is
going on inside of the church.

Again the confidentiality of my communications to
you..is very important...thank you for understanding
this. The intruders are unaware of me, my
communication with you and I want it to stay that way.
As you already know I am not an attorney and not
involved in the legal s I do not have the finances to
defend myself from them either. They have the power
and knowledge to use the legal system in anyway that
they so desire. They will stop at nothing and short of
nobody in their efforts to complete the takeover.

Too as you go forward with your campaign for
re-election...and need support of the Hispanic
community..they will assist you to encourage the votes
of other Hispanics..as soon as this matter is under
control I am sure that they would not hesitate to go
public with testimony as to how you intervened to stop
corruption in their community.

God Bless You Governor Bush...May God Work Through you
in a mighty way to resolve these issues...My prayers
are with you. 
Sinerely,

Sharon Hirschfield

I would like for you and the Honorable President of the United States, George W. Bush to be made aware of a Wrongful death Complaint that was filed in the Circuit Court (Dade County) on Wednesday, 5/15/02 against the Republic of Cuba on behalf of Lynita Fuller Caskey, who is the surviving daugther of Bobby Fuller who was assasinated (by firing squad) by Fidel Castro's revolutionary (terrorist) government.

THE REPUBLIC OF CUBA,

___________________________/

C O M P LA I N T

Plaintiff, LYNITA FULLER CASKEY, as Personal Representative of the Estate of ROBERT OTIS FULLER, ("BOBBY FULLER" ) Deceased, on behalf of Lynita Fuller Caskey, surviving daughter, and The Estate of Robert Otis Fuller, through undersigned counsel, hereby sues the Defendant, THE REPUBLIC OF CUBA ("CUBA") and alleges as follows:

1. This is an action for damages in excess of the minimum jurisdictional limits of this Court.

2. Plaintiff, LYNITA FULLER CASKEY is, and at all times material hereto was a national of the United States of America and a resident of South Florida.

3. Defendant, CUBA is, and at all times material hereto was, a foreign sovereign state as defined by the terms and provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 1603.

4. At all times material hereto, Plaintiff LYNITA FULLER CASKEY, was, is and/or will 

be duly appointed Personal Representative of the Estate of ROBERT OTIS FULLER, Deceased, and the proper party to bring this action.

5. This court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this cause pursuant to the terms of 28 U.S.C. §§ 1330 and 1331 as Plaintiff’s claims are brought pursuant to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1602, et seq. 

6. Defendant CUBA is subject to suit in a court of competent jurisdiction in any state court in the United States pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 1605.

7. Congress has crafted an exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, through the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 ("AEDPA"). Under 28 U.S.C. § 1605(7), the sovereign immunity of a foreign state is waived when a U.S. national Plaintiff seeks money damages in United States courts for acts of extrajudicial killing for which the foreign state is responsible.

8. The substantive cause of action is based upon the Civil Liability for Acts of State Sponsored Terrorism, 28 U.S.C.A. § 1605. Said statute creates a cause of action against agents of a foreign state that act under the conditions specified in section 1605(a)(7) of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.

9. An additional substantive claim lies in the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991. Said Act establishes a civil action for recovery of damages from an individual who, under actual or apparent authority of a foreign nation, engages in torture or extrajudicial killing.

10. A foreign nation is liable for damages to the individual’s legal representative, or to any person who may be a claimant in an action for wrongful death. For purposes of this Act, the term "extrajudicial killing" means a deliberate killing not authorized by a previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees

which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples. See 28 U.S.C. § 1605(e)(1).

11. Summary executions are considered "extrajudicial killing" within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1350. See Lafontant v. Aristide, 844 F.Supp. 128 (E.D.N.Y. 1994) (dicta).

12. Defendant, CUBA is designated to be a state sponsor of terrorism under the terms and provisions of 56(j) of Export Administration Act of 1979, 50 U.S.C. § 2405(j).

FACTS OF THE CASE

13. In 1903, Jennie M. Fuller, (paternal grandmother of Plaintiff), moved to Holguin, Cuba with her family from Massachusetts. Her father, Alvin Jewett purchased and developed certain land and held other assets and personal properties in Holguin, Cuba including but not limited to:

	Plantation at Holguin, Cuba consisting of approximately 120 caballerias 

of land and improvements thereof--(approximately 4,000 acres of land)

A saw mill, equipment, livestock (cattle) crops, 

A sugar cane business and other personal property

The family owned and operated a saw mill, they raised crops, cattle and grew sugar cane 

on the island.

14. Jennie M. (Jewett) Fuller, (paternal grandmother of Plaintiff), married William Otis Fuller in 1925, (both United States citizens) and had seven children, including the Plaintiff’s father, Robert Otis Fuller all of which were born in Cuba. Bobby Fuller was born on May 11, 1934 in Santiago de Cuba

15. The Fuller family assets and properties located in Holguin, Cuba were jointly owned by Plaintiff’s paternal grandparents, Jennie M. Fuller and William Otis Fuller, her husband, and by Plaintiff’s paternal uncle, Miles Chester Jewett.

16. On July 21, 1940, the family formed a corporation called Cia. Agricola De Lewiston, S.A., a Cuban Corporation. All assets were assigned to Cia. Agricola De Lewiston, S.A., which was created for the specific purpose of carrying on and/or conducting the family business in Cuba. The Cuban Corporation conducted business in Cuba continuously from July 21, 1940 until August of 1959.

17. In January of 1959, Fidel Castro and his 26th of July Communist revolutionary rebel army movement took power over Cuba and began to radically alter the economy and social structure of the island. 

18. By May of 1959 the Castro government restricted or set forth the maximum limits of land ownerships allowed for individuals and corporate entities. All additional or excess (privately owned) land was expropriated or confiscated by the government. Shortly thereafter, all lands were nationalized and became "state owned" properties.

19. In August of 1959, the Castro Government ordered that the Fuller family corporation be dissolved.

20. By September 3, 1959, the family corporation, Cia Agricola De Lewiston, S.A. was formally dissolved pursuant to orders of the Castro government at which time the family distributed the corporate assets among its stockholders as follows:

Mr. & Mrs. William Otis Fuller 68.994 caballerias of land/ 2,287.97 acres

Mr. & Mrs. Miles Chester Jewett 58.730 caballerias of land/ 1,947.60 acres

(1 caballeria equals 33.162 acres)

21. By December of 1959, the Cuban Communist Revolution was in full force and the survival of existing businesses and institutions were threatened. Due to the foregoing, the late William Otis Fuller returned to the U.S. while Jennie M. Fuller, his wife remained in Cuba to look over and protect the Fuller family land and their assets.

22. As of February of 1960, the Fuller’s land, property, and saw mill including all of it’s improvements, livestock, personal belongings and other items of personal value situated on the property, were intervened, and/or confiscated by the Castro Government.

23. Subsequently thereafter, the Plaintiff’s father, Bobby Fuller, ventured to Cuba in an effort to protect his family’s land, businesses and other interests.

24. On October 15, 1960, Bobby Fuller (ex-U.S. Marine) along with another American and two Cuban nationals, were captured and arrested by Castro agents who charged them with counter-revolutionary activities. By 4:00 P.M. on the same day, Bobby Fuller and the three others were placed in a sham trial held in Santiago De Cuba. They were all convicted within a few hours followed by an immediate appeal which took less than fifteen minutes. Sentences were instantaneously imposed and upheld as follows:

	The two Cuban Nationals were sentenced to imprisonment.

    Re:  Appointment of Anthony Schembri to Florida Corrections Commission 

Dear Governor Bush, 

     Phenomenal. Accomplished. Determined.  Overachiever.   These and a panoply of additional superlatives describe Anthony Schembri, poised to be your most commendable appointment to serve the citizens of the State.

    I have spent time with Professor Schembri, and in addition to an awesome breadth of knowledge, find him personable and incisively focused.  I understand that you are informed of his credentials from others.  To that almost quintessential record of achievement and service, I can add nothing, and I submit nothing needs to be added.

    But I can proclaim the benefit to the State of Florida of an individual whose most signal trait is that remarkably rare virtue:  he gets things done.

     Appoint.  Hire.  Employ.  But get Dr. Anthony Schembri to serve the people of Florida.  We cannot afford not to have the very best.

                                                        Sincerely, 


                                                        Nancy Argenziano

Dear Governor Bush:

As a Florida resident I want to commend you for your support of Veteran 
George Andres' right to fly Old Glory on his property.

The home owners association in his community is threatening to foreclose on 
his home despite the recently enacted FL law which upholds the right of all 
Floridians to display an American flag in a respectful manner.

I hope your support will enable this heroic veteran to keep his home and 
continue to fly the American flag which symbolizes the freedoms he fought to 
preserve!

6:00PM
 
GOVERNOR BUSH,
 
ADAM WAS ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL TUESDAY BECAUSE OF A LUMP (THOUGHT TO BE AN INFECTION OF A LYMPH NODE) BUT A CAT SCAN SHOWS THAT THERE IS A "MASS .  AS YOU CAN IMAGINE........... I AM SCARED AND HAVE BEEN AT THE HOSPITAL BY ADAMS SIDE 24/7 SINCE TUESDAY.  TODAY, I CAME HOME TO DEAL WITH THIS CRAP THAT DISTRICT 14  IS CONTINUING TO  PUT ME THROUGH. THIS LETTER TO YOU IS MY LAST EFFORT.  IF YOU CAN OR WILL NOT  DO SOMETHING, PERSONALLY, (BESIDES TELL SOMEONE ELSE TO DO SOMETHING WHICH HAS ALREADY NOT WORKED AS CARL LITTLEFIELD WAS NOT HELP AT ALL )   I WILL JUST HAVE TO TAKE ADAM OUT OF THE DISTRICT 14  DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES  (DCF)  DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES (DD)  PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY ARE MAKING MY LIFE A LIVING NIGHTMARE.   HE GETS NOTHING FROM THIS DEPARTMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT ANYWAY.  AS A SINGLE MOTHER OF 17 YRS OF 2 SONS, ONE WITH ADD AND ADAM BORN WITH SPINA BIFIDA (DEVELOPMENTALLY DELAYED AND PARAPLEGIC),   MY LIFE IS HARD JUST TRYING TO FOOD AND CLOTHING ON THE LESS THAN $9000.00/YR. I GET FROM THE GOVERNMENT MUCH LESS THE FACT THAT TO GET THEM A FREE AND APPROPRIATE PUBLIC EDUCATION IS NON EXISTENT. EVERY DAY IS A BATTLE AND I CAN NOT BATTLE  THIS AGENCY ANYMORE.  I AM BEGGING YOU TO TAKE ACTION TO GET THIS DISTRICTS DCF DD PROGRAM TO SETTLE THIS ISSUE.   EVERY TIME I HEAR FROM THEM,  THEY CHANGE THEIR STORY AS TO ADAMS CASE.   NOTHING WILL PROCEED FOR ADAM UNTIL THIS IS SETTLED AND THEY REFUSE TO GIVE MONIES BACK TO ME THAT ARE DUE ME BY A VOTE OF OUR FAMILY CARE COUNCIL (FCC).
 
FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW THE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES  (DD) PROGRAM (ERIC OLSEN) HAS FOUGHT BACK AND FORTH WITH ME ABOUT $1631. THAT BACK IN 1999 ADAMS CASE WORKER SENT TO ME BECAUSE I WAS ON ABC VOUCHERING.  THE MONEY WAS SENT TO GO TOWARD MAKING ADAMS BATHROOM WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE. (COST WILL BE $5000.00 OR MORE TOTAL)   THE DISTRICT WAS REQUIRED TO OBTAIN MORE THAN ONE BID AND WHEN I GAVE THAT PAPERWORK FROM A MAN WHO WORKED AT HOME DEPOT  TO LINDA COLKITT, ADAMS CASE WORKER AT THE TIME,  I TOLD HER TO JUST HOLD ON TO IT BECAUSE THE MAN WAS GOING TO USE HIS 13 YR. OLD SON TO HELP HIM AND I WANTED TO CHECK TO SEE IF THIS MAN HAD A CONTRACTORS LICENSE.  TEN DAYS LATER A CHECK FOR THE $1631. ARRIVED JUST AS ALL MY OTHER ABC VOUCHER MONIES HAD ARRIVED.  
 
IN A MEETING TO SIGN ADAM ONTO MED WAIVER IN MAY. 2000, WITH MARK YOUNG , THE DISTRICT 14 DD PROGRAM MANAGER (WHO WAS ACTING AS ADAMS SUPPORT COORDINATOR (SC) AT THE TIME.... HE QUIT DCF DD IN DECEMBER 2001) I REMINDED MARK THAT I HAD TO PAY VIA CREDIT CARD THAT $1631. TOWARD THE TOTAL COST WHEN THE BATHROOM WAS REMODELED.   WHEN ADAM GOT ROBIN NASON AS A SC IN  OCT. 2000 AND SHE CAME TO UPDATE ADAMS HAB PLAN,   I AGAIN REMINDED HER THAT I WOULD NEED TO PAY $1631.  TOWARD THE  BATHROOM WHEN THE DISTRICT ACTUALLY DID THE REMODELING.  I REPEATEDLY BEGGED ERIC TO SETTLE THIS MATTER BY LETTING ME PAY THE MONEY WHEN THE WORK WAS DONE AS I HAVE NO WAY TO GET $1631. CASH TO HAND TO THE DISTRICT.  HE HAS REFUSED AND AT A MEETING AT THE DISTRICT OFFICE ON MARCH 29, 2001, IN WHICH ROBIN NASON WAS FIRED FOR INCOMPETENCE,  LINDA BROPHY STATED TO ME,   "ALL OF ADAMS SERVICES WILL HAVE TO BE DISCONTINUED UNTIL YOU PAY US BACK THE MONEY"  NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I CALLED GARRETTS,  THE MEDICAL SUPPLY STORE (FROM MARCH 2001 UNTIL APRIL 2002 ...EXCEPT FOR JAN. 2002 WHEN MARK HAD QUIT AND SOMEONE APPROVED ONE MONTH) THAT WAS CONTRACTED TO SEND ADAMS SUPPLIES, APPROVAL WAS NEVER GRANTED. NOTHING ON ADAMS  HAB PLAN OR APPROVED ON HIS COST PLAN WAS IMPLEMENTED DURING THAT TIME.  LINDA BROPHY TOLD ME TO SEND RECEIPTS FOR THE MONEY AND I DID. IN A LETTER DEC. 2001, MARK YOUNG TOLD ME THE RECEIPTS WERE "UNACCEPTABLE'.  ERIC TOLD ME TO "SEND RECEIPTS FOR WORK DONE" SO I CALLED, FRANK MURILLO OF PRO-TEX CONTRACTING,  THE CONTRACTOR THAT ROBIN NASON HAD HAD COME OUT AND SUBMIT A BID IN MAY OF 2000.  HE CAME HERE ON APRIL 3, 2002 AND THE FOLLOWING OCCURRED:
 
    1.  THAT WEDNESDAY, HE AND 2 EMPLOYEES LOOKED AT THE BATHROOM & ASK  ME WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE AND I TOLD HIM AND TOLD HIM I ONLY HAD $1631. TO DO THE  WORK ( A DOORWAY FROM ADAMS ROOM TO THE BATHROOM, A SINK WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE AND AN EXHAUST FAN) AND I ASK FRANK WOULD THAT BE ENOUGH AND HE STATED"FOR YOU I WILL DO IT FOR THAT".
 
    2.  HE HAD ME MEET HIM AT HOME DEPOT AND HE FILLED A CART WITH SUPPLIES.  I TOLD HIM AT THE STORE THAT THE SINK HE BOUGHT WAS WRONG AND THAT THE DOOR HE WANTED ME TO PURCHASE WOULD NOT WORK.  HE MADE ME BUY IT ANYWAY. (THE DOOR,  SINK, FACET, AND EXHAUST FAN HAD TO BE TAKEN BACK BY ME THE NEXT DAY AND EXCHANGED .... WHICH COST ME $90.00 MORE.) THE SUPPLIES THAT DAY WERE CHARGED TO MY CREDIT CARD.  FRANK MURILLO LEFT ME THERE IN LINE TO PAY.
 
   3.  APRIL 3RD,  FRANK MET ME BACK AT MY HOME AND I GAVE HIM THE PAPERWORK FROM HOME DEPOT FOR THE SUPPLIES AND HE LOOKED AT THE PAPERWORK AND ON THE INSIDE OF HIS FOLDER,  DID THE MATH TO TAKE THAT AMOUNT OFF OF THE $1631. WHICH LEFT $1307. WHICH FRANK PROCEEDED TO TELL ME THAT HE REQUIRED AT LEAST 1/2 OF THE TOTAL THAT DAY AS A DEPOSIT.  HE TOOK MY CREDIT CARD AND CALLED HIS OFFICE AND CHARGED THE $1307. TO MY CREDIT CARD.  I TOLD HIM I WOULD TRUST HIM SINCE HE WAS PAID IN FULL INSTEAD OF JUST 1/2 AS A DEPOSIT. 
 
  4.  HIS EMPLOYEE SHOWED UP AT MY HOME THE NEXT DAY, THURSDAY, REEKING OF BOOZE AND I CALLED FRANK RIGHT AWAY.  AN HOUR LATER,  FRANK CAME AND TOLD ME "IF YOU WANT ANY WORK DONE, THEN THIS MAN IS THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN WORK TODAY OR YOU GET NO WORK DONE". HE TOLD ME THAT THE EMPLOYEE, MIKE, HAD TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD BEEN TO A PARTY AND DRINKING UNTIL 3:00 AM BUT HAD NOT BEEN DRINKING THAT MORNING.  I HAVE ENOUGH EXPERIENCE TO SAY THAT THIS MAN APPEARED TO BE UNDER THE INFLUENCE AN I TOLD FRANK THAT I DID NOT WANT MIKE TO RUN ELECTRICAL WIRING IN MY HOME THAT DAY.  FRANK TOLD MIKE NOT TO DO ANY ELECTRICAL WORK AND TOLD ME THAT CLAY WOULD COME AND DO THE ELECTRICAL WIRING THE NEXT DAY.  WHEN CLAY WAS NOT HERE BY 10:00AM,  I CALLED FRANK AND HE INFORMED ME THAT NO ONE COULD COME THAT DAY WHICH WOULD LEAVE NO AVAILABLE SINK ALL WEEKEND FOR THE BOYS.  I REMINDED FRANK THAT MIKE HAD NOT DONE MUCH WORK THURSDAY AND HE TOLD ME THAT I SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAVE LET MIKE IN THAT THURSDAY AND IT WAS MY FAULT.  HE THEN TOLD ME AGAIN NO ONE COULD COME THAT DAY.   HE TOLD ME TO GET SOME ONE ELSE TO FINISH THE JOB.  I TOLD HIM THAT HIS MAN HAD CUT THE DOORWAY 38 1/2" INSTEAD OF 36" AND THAT HIS MEN WOULD HAVE TO FIX THE MESS.  FRANKS MAN PUT 2X4S UNDER THE SINK TO HOLD IT UP AND I COMPLAINED SO THERON MADE SOME CABINETS WHICH WERE HORRIBLE (SIZE REQUIRED THAT THE SINK JUST SAT ON  THE SIDES OF THE  CABINET,  THE SINK COULD NOT BE CENTERED, AND THE COLOR WAS NOT AT ALL COMPATIBLE TO ANY WOOD IN OUR HOME MUCH LESS THE WOOD MIRROR CABINET ABOVE THE  SINK.   ON MAY 1ST, FRANK FINALLY HAD THERON JUST PURCHASE THE SINK STAND THAT I HAD TOLD FRANK AT HOME DEPOT ON APRIL 3RD, THAT I WANTED AND HE HAD REFUSED.  I KNOW NOW THAT FRANK BOUGHT JUST THE MINIMUM SUPPLIES AND CHEAPEST SUPPLIES IN  ORDER TO INCREASE THE LABOR MONEY HE WOULD GET.
 
  4.  MAY 2, 2002  HIS MAN, THERON, FINISHED INSTALLING THE STAND AND SINK AND LEFT STATING THAT HE WAS FINISHED AND NOT GOING TO RETURN.   
 
THE WORK IS AWFUL.   ANOTHER CONTRACTOR IS  TO BE HERE  TOMORROW MORNING CONTACTED BY ADAMS NEW SC  TO FINISH TO MAKE THE BATHROOM WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE .....   (I AM GOING TO CALL AND CANCEL THIS APPOINTMENT AS I WILL NOT LEAVE ADAM ALONE AT THE HOSPITAL AGAIN WHEN IT IS OBVIOUS TO ME THAT THIS DISTRICT DD DOES NOT INTEND TO SETTLE THE MATTER OF THE $1631. NO MATTER WHAT I DO AND DO NOT INTEND TO  PAY FOR WORK TO PROCEED TO FIX THIS BATHROOM AND PUT IN A ROLL IN SHOWER FOR ADAM TO BE INDEPENDENT NOR INTEND TO REIMBURSE ME THE MONIES FROM THE FND CONFERENCE)..... THIS NEW CONTRACTOR TOLD ME HE HAS PICTURES OF FRANKS PRIOR JOBS THAT  HE USES FOR STATE WORKSHOPS THAT SHOW WHAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN YOU USE THE WRONG CONTRACTOR. HE TOLD ME TO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING AND HE WILL TAKE OF GETTING THE BATHROOM DONE RIGHT FOR ADAM TO USE. DD IS SUPPOSE TO COVER THE COST OF THIS.
 
  5.  FRANK MURILLO WENT UP IN FRONT OF THE CONTRACTOR LICENSING BOARD ON MAY 9TH.  HE DID NOT COME BUT HIS LAWYER GOT THE CHARGES DROPPED BECAUSE THE MAN WHO FILED THE CHARGES TOLD ME THAT FRANK PAID HIM OFF WITH $3000.00.  FRANK MURILLO  HAS HAD HIS CONTRACTORS LICENSE TAKEN FROM HIM BEFORE THIS AND NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW HOW HE GOT ANOTHER LICENSE  TO MAKE MONEY (HIS LICENSE IS UNDER HIS SONS NAME AS I UNDERSTAND IT NOW).... ANYWAY, I TELL YOU ALL THIS TO MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND HOW THIS DISTRICT 14 DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES (DCF) DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES PROGRAM TREATS THEIR CLIENTS AND THE FAMILIES WHO LOVE THEM AND CARE FOR THEM...... THIS MAN NOW HAS TOLD DD LIES BY STATING THAT HE NEVER SAW THE PAPERWORK FROM HOME DEPOT TO DEDUCT THE COST OF  SUPPLIES FROM THE $1631. TO GET THE $1307. THAT HE CHARGED ON MY CARD AND HE STATES THAT HE RETURNED $200.00 TO ME WHICH HE DID NOT AND NOW THE DCF DD PROGRAM ON TOP OF THE $1700. I HAVE ALREADY INCURRED ON MY CREDIT CARD FOR THIS WORK, DEMANDS THAT I GIVE THEM $200.00...... WHY WOULD DISTRICT 14 DD PEOPLE CALL ME A LIAR BECAUSE I WROTE BACK TO BRENDA BRYAN WHEN SHE WROTE TO ASK  THE DETAILS AND I EXPLAINED TO HER EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE TOLD YOU.... THE TRUTH ON MY LIFE AND THE LIVES OF MY SONS......... FRANK TOOK THE PAPERWORK AND CONFIRMED THE COST OF SUPPLIES  AND DEDUCTED THAT COST FROM THE $1631. TO GET THE $1307. LABOR COSTS.... I EVEN SENT A LETTER TO FRANK DETAILING THE EVENTS AND STATED IN THE LETTER THAT HE WAS TO SEND ME WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION IF HE DID NOT CONCUR WITH THE EVENTS AS I STATED.  I NEVER HEARD FROM HIM AND EVEN THOUGH I SENT A COPY OF THIS LETTER TO BRENDA BRYAN,  THAT IS NOT ENOUGH TO END THIS NIGHTMARE.   I FAXED BRENDA FROM THE HOSPITAL THAT THEY CAN TELL FRANK TO SEND THE $200. DIRECTLY TO THEM AT DD AS I DO NOT W NT HIS MONEY NOW....... I AM FORCED TO FILE SEPARATE COMPLAINT PAPERWORK TO TAKE THIS MAN IN FRONT OF THE BOARD AGAIN  AND TAKE TIME TO GO BACK IN FRONT OF THE BOARD AGAIN  MYSELF...... MORE TIME I CERTAINLY DO NOT HAVE.
 
MY QUESTION TO YOU IS THIS......WHAT WILL YOU DO?  I HAVE BEEN LIVING ON MY LAND IN POLK COUNTY SINCE FEB. 99.   EXCEPT FOR DIAPERS AND SOME OTHER MEDICAL SUPPLIES (WHICH HAVE NOW ALL BEEN DENIED) ADAM, AS A DD CLIENTS IN THIS DISTRICT HAS GOT NOTHING SINCE FEB. 99.  SINCE COMING TO POLK COUNTY, I HAVE HAD IN HOME RESPITE CARE ON ALL 4  OF ADAMS ANNUAL HAB PLANS AND HAVE NOT RECEIVED ONE DAY.  ALL I HAVE BEEN   OFFERED IS TO TAKE ADAM TO SOME FOSTER HOME BUT SINCE ADAM MUST CATHERIZE FOR RESIDUAL URINE EVERY 4 HOURS,  I WILL NOT TAKE HIM INTO AN UNKNOWN ENVIRONMENT TO HAVE SOMEONE NOT QUALIFIED CATHERIZE HIM ON SOME COMMUNITY TOILET.  IT SEEMS TO ME ACCORDING TO WHAT I HAVE HAD TO ENDURE IN THIS DISTRICT SINCE FEB. 99,  THAT THIS DISTRICT HAS ONE THING IN MIND AND THAT IS HOW THE DISTRICT CAN DENY SERVICES AND SPEND THE LEAST AMOUNT OF MONEY, IF ANY, FOR A CLIENT.   DELMARVA IS NOW IN ITS SECOND YEAR OF THE NOW 4 YEAR CONTRACT OF 3.9 MILLION/YEAR TO MAKE CONDITIONS BETTER FOR THE POPULATION OF PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA, BUT AS OF YET THEY HAVE NOT DONE ONE THING TO MAKE ANYTHING BETTER FOR ADAM.  I CAN NOT EVEN GET MINUTES OF THE LAVISH, LUXURY MEETINGS THAT THESE PEOPLE KEEP HAVING AROUND THE STATE "TO MAKE DD SERVICES BETTER" .  ANOTHER INSTANCE (DELMARVAS 3.9 MILLION/YEAR AND THE PEOPLE OF THE IQC) OF A LOT OF PEOPLE MAKING BIG BUCKS IN SALARIES AND A LOT OF THEIR TRAVELING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY PAID FOR BY THE STATE OF FLORIDA.................. BUT NOTHING DONE FOR THE PEOPLE THEY ARE HIRED TO SERVE.
 
IT IS NOW 12:45 AM ON MONDAY... I HAVE SPENT VALUABLE TIME AWAY FROM ADAM WHO IS LYING IN A HOSPITAL BED RIDDLED WITH FEVER TO COME HOME AND REACH OUT TO YOU FOR HELP........................ PLEASE LET ME HEAR FROM YOU.................... PLEASE .

Jeb,
 
Thanks for taking a moment to speak with me on Sunday.  My name is Ira Baum.
The purpose of this note is request your guidance to fund a project that I am working with in conjuction with Florida International Universiy department of Engineering.
The goal of the project is:
1.    To improve the health care of Floridians and potentially all Americans.
2.    Fund a major university in Florida's R&D department.
 
Background:
 
I am a practicing podiatrist in Miami for over twenty years.  During that time it became apparent that the greatest percentage of foot problems that afflict the population that I cared for, was due to diseases such as diabetes and poor foot mechanics .  It is well known that  custom foot supports, or "foot orthotics" have the potential to prevent and reduce the risks of developing foot illnesses, and assist in healing foot wounds of diabetics that can lead to prolonged disability and amputation.   
Custom foot supports are nothing new, however the cost and the time involved to purchase the foot supports is and remains prohibitive to most Floridians and Americans.  During the last 10 years I have developed a proprietary approach a "System and Method to Manufacture Custom Foot Supports".  
Basically the system consists of a scanner to scan the bottom surface of the foot, analysis software that will modify the scan and output unique tool path patterns to a CNC milling machine to manufacture a custom foot support for the individual.  The goal of the project is to bring to the public a cost effective, and rapidly produced foot insert.  The foot insert will help prevent foot problems, and improve comfort and function of the foot, reducing disabilities that lead to the increased cost of healthcare, and labor.
 
Need:
 
I have personally funded the early phases of the project.  At the last meeting with Professors Chin - Sheng Chin, Ph.D and Kinzy Jones, Ph.D, it was decided to explore additional sources of funding for the project.  Presently we are seeking a department or agency of the State of Florida  that can fund Phase I of the research and development with the department of engineering at Florida International University.
 
It is my sincerely hope that you can lead me in the appropriate direction so that this worthwhile project can become a reality, and benefit the citizens of Florida.
 
Sincerely,
 
 
Ira M. Baum, D.P.M.

Dear Governor, 
  
I had sent you some information regarding our charitable technology 
program called LEAP last fall at the request of several Senators and 
Cheryl Cliett, the teacher in residence. You responded and thought it 
was an interesting idea and were turning things over to the Secretary's 
and Commissioner's office for follow up. 
  
My organization did get a response back from a middle level DOE person 
that I had already spoken with. I was never afforded the opportunity to 
discuss the program and its potential strategic importance in solving 
the obsolete technology and Digital Divide problems existing with in our 
state's public schools and underprivileged communities with Secretary 
Horne or Commissioner Crist. 
  
I am going to give this one more try before we eliminate the state of 
Florida as a partner in this effort. Please review the information 
provided in the attached letter (revised 5/16/02). The idea we speak of 
has the power to assist the many charitable efforts hoping to improve 
technology-based learning in poor communities and to help schools 
replace aging equipment via a cost effective and efficient process. 
  
My organization is offering to help Florida build a program that over 
the next ten years will deliver at least $24,000,000 in direct net 
benefit and help hundreds of thousands of children receive a better 
education. 
  
If after review of this information there is interest to discuss things 
further I would enjoy meeting with you or the Lt. Governor to explain 
things further. Thank you! 
  
Sincerely,

Subject:	Cervical Cancer and Medical Insurance

Dear Elected Representatives: My wife Dee, whose family has a history of dire results from cervical cancer, recently had her 6-month checkup "to rule out cervical cancer" as the doctors would say. She is covered for medical insurance as the "dependent" of a Retired State Employee under my Blue Cross/Blue Shield PPO. 
My concern for your due diligence is that Pap Smears and CA-125 blood tests are not covered by medical insurance because they are considered "routine". And my question for you and your wives and dependent daughters is: What the H..l is "routine" about cervical cancer and the tests to "rule it out"? I am not sure that a sonogram to "rule out breast cancer" is considered "routine", so I did not include it. Ask your wives. Thanks for your consideration of my questions. 
Very Truly Yours,

By the way, another reason to love the NGA (and i'm just kidding) . . . . .
. I get their weekly best practices email on friday, kind of spanning the
globe for "good policy" each week.  However, and it does not go unnoticed to
afficionados like me, every week the NGA manages to include links to a few
reports done not by states but by think tanks --- and this is a good example
below -- notice who the think tanks are that get their reports on this email
and just in this one issue -- the Brookings Institute; Pew Oceans
Commission; the Urban Institute -- I've never seen a Heritage Foundation
paper linked here!!!!!!!

So again, when we pay dues to NGA, we are funding an organization not only
to make liberal policy, but to promote liberal think tanks.   Just more food
for thought.

About the Center
The NGA Center for Best Practices helps Governors and their key policy staff
develop and implement innovative solutions to governance and policy
challenges facing them in their states.
Through the staff of the Center, Governors and their policy advisors can:
*       quickly learn about what works, what doesn't, and what lessons can
be learned from others grappling with the same problems;

*       obtain assistance in designing and implementing new programs or in
making current programs more effective; and

*       receive up-to-date information about what is happening in other
state capitals and in Washington, D.C., so Governors are better prepared to
react to emerging issues.

Your May 11 column, "Jury's still out on who's running agency," misses the
point about our response to the Rilya Wilson tragedy.

It is not about what the "Tallahassee crowd" thinks or doesn't think.  It is
about a missing child.

It is not about who is "off-camera" and who is on.  It is about a missing
child.

Rilya Wilson's story illustrates that while child welfare in Florida is much
improved, we still have a long way to go.  Our doubling of funding over four
years has helped.  More caseworkers have helped.  Innovative programs such
as community-based care have helped.  But we still have a long way to go.

Countless DCF employees, led by Secretary Kearney, perform their jobs with
the greatest integrity and commitment.  They are not "on-camera" as much as
I am because I am the Governor.

But out in front or behind the scenes, all of us are working together to
ensure the safety of every Florida child in our care.  We are doing a better
job.  We are committed to doing better still.  With the continued support of
concerned Floridians, we will.



Sincerely,



Jeb Bush

Good Morning, 

I am looking  to the selection of Dr. Fred Gainous as  President of FAMU as the beginning of much needed changes  such as fiscal accountability, administrative responsibility, effective teaching, increased student success and a working environment that provides support for everyone.  This is also the beginning of the Board of Trustees becoming THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES of the University instead of the Board being directed by the University.

The next six to eight months will be a critical time in FAMU's history.  I am sincerely hoping that we can keep the current movement which is necessary to "reclaim" the University.

Stefani Stauffer, age 16 years, is a child who has been living with Gwen
and John Turner in an independent living status up until May 6th. The child
left the Turner residence and reported to the abuse registry on May 7th
that she was kicked out of the Turner home. Note: Ms Turner is employed by
Family Continuity, but is not responsible for managing Stefani's case.  As
of this writing, Stefani is with Paula Kaminski, who is a 19 year old
friend. Stefani has requested that she be assessed today to determine
whether or not she can reside with Ms Kaminski as a roomate.

This situation is currently being investigated by Deborah Hansen,
caseworker for Family Continuity Program.  In addition, a motion has been
filed today before Judge Sullivan informing the court of the recent events
and requesting an order be entered allowing the child to be "picked up".

Prior to these events, case management was being provided by Carol
Mannering, Family Continuity Program.

I will continue to work closely with the Family Continuity staff as the
case develops further.

I will provide you updates as appropriate or as you request.

Thanks.

Farm Bureau Challenges Plowing Decision in U.S. Supreme Court

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

PARK RIDGE, Ill., May 16, 2002 -- The American Farm Bureau Federation
has filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the U.S. Supreme Court on
behalf of a California farming operation. The Borden Ranch orchard and
vineyard has been prevented from expanding by federal agencies that
claim routine deep plowing is not a "normal farming activity." The
Supreme Court is being asked to grant a review of this earlier decision
from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

The Borden Ranch orchard and vineyard, located in Sacramento County,
Calif., has been prohibited from planting additional vineyards on its
private farmland due to faulty interpretations of federal wetlands
regulations and of allowances for normal farming activities. The U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
have ruled that routine deep plowing, required to plant the vineyards,
"pollutes" the temporary wetlands with dirt. The agencies claim,
therefore, that a permit is required.

According to the Farm Bureau brief, Section 404 of the Clean Water Act
(CWA), which governs wetlands, clearly contains an "exemption of normal
farming practices from the burden of the...permit program." The lower
court ruling, according to AFBF, "expands the reach of the CWA far
beyond what Congress intended, at best creating uncertainties about
permissible conduct and at worst exposing farmers and ranchers pursuing
routine farming activities to substantial penalties."

"The federal agencies, especially the Environmental Protection Agency,
Corps of Engineers and the Fish and Wildlife Service, with the aid of
the lower courts, have been happy to cooperate in expanding the reach of
the Section 404 wetlands program," AFBF stated. "Now the Ninth Circuit
has planted the seeds for further expansion."

AFBF is concerned about the ramifications of the lower court's decision
because it:

*	Narrows the normal farming exemption of Section 404 of the CWA
and places the Corps of Engineers and the EPA in the business of
regulating day-to-day farming and ranching practices.
*	Rules that normal agricultural plowing can result in the
discharge of a pollutant (soil).
*	Finds that a farmer or rancher's plow can be defined as a point
source of pollution.
*	And expands interpretations of the Section 404 so that a farmer
or rancher would not be able to change his or her cropping patterns
without a federal permit out of concern of a penalty for violating the
CWA.

According to the AFBF brief, deep ripping (plowing) is a normal tillage
practice and is, therefore, "a normal farming or ranching activity that
is excluded or exempted from Section 404 regulation."

"As this case perfectly demonstrates, implementation of the normal
farming exemption has not proceeded as Congress intended...and (has) not
fulfilled Congress' aim of minimizing the interference of federal
regulators in the routine decisions of farmers and ranchers," AFBF
stated.

"This is not a case about a farmer or rancher indiscriminately
discharging dredged or fill material into navigable waters. This is a
case of a farmer attempting to plant a different crop on his farmland, a
very normal farming activity."

If review is granted by the Supreme Court, the appeal will be heard by
the nation's highest court during its 2002-2003 fall term.

Dear Governor Bush, I am writing to ask for your support regarding the
appointment of Tim Bailey of Pompano Beach to the Board of the North Broward
Hospital District. I have known Tim for over ten years. He has a strong
character, good business sense and is a terrific father and husband. Tim has
lived in Broward for most of his life and is involved in his community. I
believe that he would be an asset to the North Broward Hospital District.
Thank you in advance for your consideration.

May 18. 2002                          Concerning HB 1307

Dear Governor Bush:

We met last Tuesday morning at the Tampa Vandenburg Airport.  Thank you for 
taking the time to listen to me.  I apologize for throwing a curve ball at 
you, but I needed to get your attention on the negative aspects of HB 1307.  
Six PVA members, including myself, had met with Alan Florez and Kevin Tang 
and others on May 2nd, but after the meeting, we got the sense that we hadn't 
"gotten through" to them.  You put me in touch Tuesday morning with Greg 
Turbeville. When I spoke with Greg, he assured me that he will investigate 
the issues that PVA and others have raised.

In spite of what Julie Shaw told us at the Florida Building Commission 
Hearings in St. Pete Beach last Monday, people with disabilities are 
convinced that this is a bad bill.  Also, code officials do not like the 
"privatization" aspect of 1307.  The "Waiver Process" system is working OK 
now.  We don't need a 20% cap on accessibility renovations.  If it ain't 
broke, why fix it?

By the way, I was a resident of New Jersey, a businessman and a member of the 
NJ Republican Party before I moved to Tampa five years ago.  I was a neighbor 
of Christie Whitman and was on her election campaign committee. We went to 
the same church.  I was present on the Whitehouse lawn when your dad signed 
the Americans With Disabilities Act on July 26, 1990.  Before your election 
to Governor, you and I talked at a Republican Rally at the Hyatt in Tampa.  
Based on my experiences as a wheelchair-user, I offered these words of 
wisdom:  

"People with disabilities perceive that Democrats do more for them than 
Republicans."  

Since your election to the Florida Statehouse, you and your administration 
have earned the respect of Floridians with disabilities.  May I request that 
you follow through and veto 1307?  Allow time for a thorough review and a 
rewrite of this bill during the 2003 legislative session.  

Respectfully yours,

Subject:	Docks, Port of the Islands, Lee County, New Plans

Colleen, 

1) I am assuming that I will not hear back from you on the Lee County dock permit issue - unless there is still "dialogue" going on with Atlanta? It's been over a month. Is the Governor aware that people cannot get permits to build single-family docks in Lee County? 

2) I don't understand why you continue telling people that you differ with me on whether or not the Federal restrictions in Port of the Islands forced me out of business. The "no in-water construction zone" has been in place for years - so I am told, and I was allowed to work. But, now, the zones have been made public, and the last communication from USFW on the subject (facilitated by you) made it clear to me that the zone would be enforced from this time forward. If this information was accurate, and I had kept working, I would have been forced to close my operation in mid-stream. I chose to give my employees notice, and let them find other work. I also chose to quit charging supplies, equipment & repairs as I could not carry a heavy debt load if my business could not operate during that time. 

I did come up to Naples, and I tried to farm new work - but in the dock business, specifically in our market, selling a job has a 2 month to 1 year lead time. I could not fill my schedule as the majority of our waterfront people were out of town during the time I had to make my decision. 

Let's assume that I followed your advice, and kept on working through the "no in-water construction window" in defiance of the law that was brought to my attention. How long would it have been before the "Club" would have lowered the boom on my operation? Who would have paid my ongoing business expenses, legal fees, fines, etc? In the private sector, we weigh risks - especially those of us that pay last month's bills with this month's proceeds. The FACT that the zones were to be enforced, the pressure that was being brought to bear from the "environmental" community, and the lack of response from our State Government made my mind up for me. I CHOSE not to VIOLATE the federal rule. Are you saying - to me, Commissioner Rood, and whoever else heard the conversation between you and Bonnie - that you condone my working in defiance of a federal rule designed to protect manatees? 

I can't afford that risk. January 10th, 2,000, I wrote the Governor, and laid out my concerns. He instructed you to schedule a meeting with me - which you never did. The rest is history, and was in the best interests of my family. 

3) Now, Lee County is under a Federal ban on the issuance of single family docks. Again, I have tried to work within the bounds of the established chain of communication. Again, response is slow - if there is any at all. The fact that manatee mortality sky-rocketed the year that the new FFWCC plans were implemented in Lee County has not been revisited - even though Jim Antista and David Arnold both say that something is wrong "down there." Arnold, Hartman, & Kipp Frolich have all been asked about the situation. All tell me that I am wrong - that the new zones did not exacerbate the mortality problem. But nobody can give me another explanation - they won't even try! 

4) The most disturbing thing is that the new plans that we reviewed with David Arnold last week all look very similar to the Lee County plan - vast shore-line buffer zones that force all vessel traffic into the intracoastal channels. Our questions continue to go unanswered, more restrictions are being discussed, planned, and implemented, and more people are being hurt - both economically and by the permanent alteration of their life-styles. 

The frustration of the masses is higher than I have ever seen it - but the people, for the most part, have lost the urge to go to meetings and speak. They did that for a whole year, and neither Staff nor the Governor's office would, or could help. They now feel as though it is a waste of their time to participate - that driving to meeting after meeting after meeting - attended by a VAST majority of boaters - went un-noticed, or ignored by those in any position to help. The people now say that they will take their concerns to the polls in November. 

Things are not getting better - they are getting worse.

Subject:	Thank You From The Wind Storm Consortium Of Florida

Dear Ms. Collins;


     I would like to thank you and your staff for taking the time to meet with the Wind Storm Consortium of Florida Friday. 

     I'm looking forward in working with you and I believe that we will be able to learn a great deal from you and your staff. It is very obvious that you all have a great deal of experience to share with the consortium members.

    Ms. Collins, the agenda of the consortium is a very simple. It is designed to offer help and experiences from the private sector to make an even more positive difference on the wind storm risk we all face. We feel that you and your staff have put in place with the new building codes, a great platform to expand on. We feel that going the next step by forming a public-private partnership that focuses on even  stronger building will pave the way for stronger mandated building codes in the years to come. When we started forming the consortium I was impressed with desire that we found from the members to focus on the wind storm issues and come up with the suggestions that we have shared with you and your staff. The consortium has great concerns on this issue due to the fact that the wind storm issue effects each and every homeowner in our state. If not addressed now, it will be a much larger issue for their children and so on. I hope that you recognized that on Friday. Also exciting is the related positive influences that our partnership will create. For example, 850 plus job very quickly, education for unskilled labor, the drive for more technology, and a think tank of new idea's and products in one location focusing on one common cause. That added value will benefit all of us here in Florida. This opportunity has possibilities that we have not even come close to uncovering. Now we both have the opportunity to uncover them, together. I will predict that this public-private partnership will become a model for the rest of country, not only to midigate wind damage and drive new technologies and create needed jobs. We can demonstrate what can be accomplished when two motivated partes come together under the structure of a public-private partnership to protect one of life's major staples, homeownership. 


     Again, thank you for taking the time to meet with the consortium members last Friday. I'm looking forward to working with you and your staff.

Thank You,


Jay E Jones, Consortium Chairman,

Mark Howard's May 2002 editor's page, "Political Football," fumbled the data
on per-pupil spending in Florida's public schools.

He states that our claims of funding increases are "true in the aggregate,
but spending per student has fallen."  In fact, funding per-student has
increased over the past four years, despite huge growth in the number of
students attending Florida's public schools.

We have increased funding by 27 percent, while the number of students has
increased by 10.5 percent.  Next year's $1.1 billion increase, for example,
is a 9 percent increase in total funds and still a 6 percent increase per
student.  Districts will receive on average $295 more per student next year
than this year.

Although accountability and performance - not funding - are the most
important criteria in judging Florida's public schools, our funding record
is better (in the aggregate, per-student, adjusted for inflation, however
you want to count it) than that of my predecessor in either of his two
terms.

I welcome honest debate on how we can build on the success of the last four
years in Florida's public schools.  But misinformation about funding makes
honest debate less likely to happen.



Sincerely,



Jeb Bush

JEB IN WONDERLAND

     Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a tropical paradise called Phlorida.  The people there were generally happy, but they had a problem with their children.  They were all born needing hospitalization, and the caring adults were quite concerned as many of their children, after spending years in hospitals, and finally leaving with "Certificates of Excellent Health," seemed unable to function well.  The Hospital Leaders said "Everything is fine in this best of all possible tropical paradises, and, look, almost all your children have Certificates of Excellent Health!"  "But," said the parents, "many of them can't walk or talk."  "How can you tell?" asked the Health Leaders, "They look fine to us, but just give us some more money and everything will be even better!"

     And so for many years the parents did just that, but things didn't seem to change much.  "If only the children weren't so young, or so small, or if we only had more money for the doctors and nurses, then things would be even better,...and, anyway, look at ALL these health diplomas, things are fine!" said the Health Leaders.

     Then one day the Phloridians elected (yes, really!) a new governor named Jeb. Half the voters said, "He's too tall," the other half said, "He's not too bright," and the other half said, "Maybe he'll help our kids."  (You see, in Phlorida elections, half plus half plus....oh, never mind.)

     Well, Jeb visited the hospitals and asked, "Just how sick are these kids?"  "They're fine," said the Health Leaders, "Just give us more money and go away."  "They're sick," said the parents, "Look, many of them can't even sit up!"

     Jeb said, "Well, why don't we count how many can sit up, how many can walk, and how many can talk, and if there are some hospitals where almost no one can do this, let's let those kids go to a different hospital?"  

     "Gee," said the Health Leaders, "You really are not too bright, are you?  Of course we can't count what the kids can do, and even if we did, what would that prove?  Look how happy they are! Look how pretty the hospital rooms are!  We deal with the whole patient here, not just with their physical condition."

     "But, said Jeb, "you people are running hospitals, and we really need to see that our kids are healing......"

     "No, no, no, you just don't get it, do you?" said the Hospital Leaders. "It wouldn't be fair to measure health and, anyway, there's no accurate way to do it, and some hospitals, where no one is getting better, might not get any new patients and just think what that would cost the taxpayer!  If only the kids didn't have such short hair, or so little money, things would be different."

     And so it became clear to all Phloridians that the only answer was to elect a different governor.

The more serious problem, one these homeowners all have in common is that they have no one to turn to if they can't afford a private attorney.  This grave injustice has been going on far to long and something needs to be done about it whether it's done at the county or state level or both.  But action MUST be taken now.  Bob Doran

Bob,

I sent this message to the Governor, Rep. Dennis Baxley and Senator Rod
Smith:
********************************
I have been reading about people across Florida losing their homes --
including one tragic story in Ocala two years ago -- because property owners
have failed to pay Home Owners Association dues -- for whatever reason.

This is obviously getting to be a major problem. I understand there are
about 378 such foreclosures pending now, and I am told 12 sales on the
courthouse steps today in various counties.

Admittedly, all or certainly most of these property owners have had notice
from their associations.  In some cases, particularly with older people,
there may be real troublesome cases where widows (or widowers for that
matter) simply do not understand what they are getting in the mail.

Sometimes it is just stubbornness.

Every problem has a solution if we will but seek it out. As a solution that
I believe is worth considering, and I believe would be a good issue for you
to solve the problem with is to:

Propose to the legislature a different way of handling the matter. If
property owners assessments were handled like unpaid property taxes . . . a
certificate sold this year, another certificate sold next year and then a
court ordered foreclosure with proper advertising, notice etc AFTER the two
certificates . . . the chances of a real tragic case slipping through the
cracks would be lessened considerably.

I am not a lawyer and do not know just how to make it work, and I am sure
the homeowners association lobbyists will object . . . but government can do
anything it wants to solve real or imagined problems. This is an issue that
is embarrassing to every public official when questions arise.

In a case here two years ago, Ed Dean, an attorney who was named Sheriff
late in the Chiles administration to replace a popular sheriff who stole
county money, had his own old law firm buying a widow's house during his
campaign.

Fortunately, we were able to get it worked out for the time being, and the
lady got her house back but later was declared incompetent when it was about
to go to be sold again . . . but a delay process such as I suggest might
really help the situation.

I am going to propose this to Dennis Baxley and Rod Smith too.  I hope you
will get your people to figure out a way to make it work, and let's solve a
real problem.

And thanks for being our Governor!!!

Paul

Dear Sharon,

It was a pleasure talking to you. I think you've done right by sending your
personal appeal to the Governor. Hopefully, he's received enough information
from all of us to make the right decision.

Please keep us informed.

You might have read that Jan is willing to contribute to a 'defense fund'
which he suggested after reading Mario's recent message. I think others,
including myself, will contribute, also.

However, before a defense fund can be established I hope you'll follow
through with my suggestion to contact Mario and his wife to visit with Tay
and compile as much documentation as is available to bolster the reason's
for a defense fund.

I read you're note about waiting to contact Mario and I'm sharing this
message with all of the members of our organization.

Thank you for being whom you are. With you, we are on the right side of
'justice' and will attempt to balance the scale for the residents of Miramar
and Vista Verde.

The best to you and yours,
Bob,

Dear Governor:

Seven weeks after my e-mail to you , our test results
for FCAT came in (today).  Not one word about any
re-take, just a notation that we had slight
improvement in our scores.

In the intervening seven weeks, the other teacher who
reported irregularities has been "railroaded" out of
his job and an obvious (to me) campaign of harassment
has begun against me.

This is the thanks one gets for trying to do what's
right - and for trying to obey the law, even if it
means "whistle-blowing" on their own place of
employment?

I no longer wonder why so few people ever bother to do
so.
Never again will I bother to do so either.

Disappointed,

Jeb,

As you will recall from the attached, we corresponded a while back when
I
was CEO of Enterasys and had visited with Roy Cales. At the time, we
were
moving our Latin American offices from Brazil and setting up shop in
Miami
(which we accomplished!).

I have since left Enterasys and am an independent business technology
consultant. People tell me I am pretty good at it! I can cut to the
chase.

Is there any way that I can help you with your technology issues in the
state? I would be willing to give you some pro bono assistance. It would
be
a way to help, and to give some back to the State of Florida, which has
been
very kind to myself and my family over the years. My parents still live
in
Hialeah, and my brother is a long term employee, a lawyer now, with the
Dade
County Public Safety department. My two girls were born in Miami, and
its
where I met and married my wife Bonnie.

I used to work for Tony Burns at Ryder, as the CIO of his Logistics
business
unit, and was a long time resident of Florida for 40 years.

I was also CIO of Entergy in New Orleans, Louisiana as well as of
Cabletron,
in New Hampshire where I worked for Craig Benson who is currently
running
for Governor of NH. I've got a few years experience running large
technology
organizations.

I think I can help, and would love to.

Best regards,

Henry

Jeb,

You meet a lot of people and may not remember me. I am a long time

native, raised in South Florida, now President of Enterasys (a Cabletron
Company), a headquartered in New Hampshire (local boy makes good!). We
met
at Ryder once when you and Armando Codina visited there. I worked for
Tony
Burns for about 10 years.

I recently met with your new CIO, Roy Cales, in Tallahassee. Roy is an
absolutely great choice. Further proof of your good people selection
skills.
We had a good meeting, and am confident Roy is going to do great things
from
a technology perspective for my home state. Hopefully, our solutions
will
play a part in the State's strategy.

One other thing I wanted to mention, currently our Latin American
headquarters is based in Brazil. I am very interested in moving them to
Miami. Is there someone on your staff we can discuss this with?

Dear Mr. Governor:              
 
I want to take this opportunity to thank you profusely for your time today.  As you know, I share your passion for the safety, education, and overall well-being of children; especially the children of the great State of Florida, my home.
 
When I first learned about the program from the Save-A-Friend group, which I introduced you to this afternoon, I immediately recognized the benefits of having a centralized mechanism that would provide both consistency and efficiency to intelligence gathering about security threats to our schools, their respective students, teachers and administrators.  I was, and still am, excited about what such a program would mean to the State of Florida’s school systems. 
 
Given your leadership and unyielding commitment to protecting and educating Florida’s children, I felt an obligation to introduce you to the Save-A-Friend program and wanted you to hear directly from its authors.  Unfortunately, as I found out to my surprise in today’s meeting, pride of authorship may be getting in the way of an otherwise very good program that could be implemented at the state level.  I hope the Save-A-Friend group finds it wise to follow your advice; I have strongly recommended that they do. 
 
Warmest personal regards from your friend,
Eduardo Stern

Dear Gov Bush:

I am stunned and appalled that a brand new law had to be initiated that
prohibits forging, selling, etc., of Florida driver licenses.

If there isn't an already existing law in the statutes that deals with any
and all forged government documents, permits, the penalties associated
therewith, etc., there certainly ought to be.

If there isn't the above mentioned law already in existence, then I would
say the the drivers license bureau, all law enforcement agencies, the
legislature, their bureaucratic staff, the governor's office and staff,
among others, are derelict and should be punished.  For heaven's sake, get
busy and make a law so that forgeries of ANY state, city, county, and
federal government document is a felony crime.

That just amazes me.

Thank you for trying to answer my questions at the Cafe.. Keep up the good work. Now my  other questions . Why can't we have some group home and work for are children  in the farming commuities not just for the cities? We also need respite care in the rural area ,too.  Example Suwannee county. I want my grandson to be taken care of after  I'm gone. He is very intellect orally.  The written word is where the brain damage is. The Doctors can't explain it. So if he could have a group home in our area he could work and care for his self and be a complete person we a little help. Also get a Job Marylin Moore. P. S. Sir I talk to other parents in this area and they say nobody cares.. I told them to make there voice heard but they have given up.

Dear Governor Bush:

I hope this finds you doing well.

Last Friday, my fiancé Donna attended the Palm Beach County Job Fair to seek
employment in order to work closer to our home.  As you know, we presently
live in Palm
Beach County and Donna's present commute is about 45 minutes each way to and
from Sunrise, Florida.

There is a elementary school in Delray Beach about 7 miles from our house,
called Pine Grove.  Pine Grove's student body consist of students of low
income families, with low test scores.

Donna teaches fourth grade and has had enormous success working with low
income students who are below grade level.  Based on the makeup of Donna's
classroom, she continually achieves high FCAT test scores even higher than
schools in better areas like Boca Raton and other upscale communities. (see
test scores below). Donna achieves these high scores even though 95% of her
classroom receives free or reduced lunches.  Like I told you before, if all
things are equal, I will put Donna up against not only any fourth grade
teacher in Florida but any fourth grade teacher in the US.

Pine Grove is very interested in hiring Donna and would like to have her as
one of their teachers.   Unfortunately, if she moves from Broward County to
Palm Beach County, Palm Beach County will only accept 10 years and instead
of 12 and
they want to put her on a three year probation/annual contract.

I believe it is in your best interest and the State of Florida to make
exceptions in order to assist great teachers like Donna, to stay in the
profession as long as possible.  Also, it is not fair for teachers of
Donna's ability that have dedicated so many good years to the state
education program to be put on probation or lose two years just because they
are moving from one county to another.

I would greatly appreciated it if you would have someone contact me this
week to discuss this matter in more detail.  I can be reached on my cell
phone at 310.867.4365. Though my cell # is a LA number, I am located in Boca
Raton, Florida.

Thank you for your time and consideration to this matter.

Thank you Vic. The retention bill past last year should have impacted
benefits but not necessarily tenure in its complete form. I am asking
someone on my staff to respond in detail to you asap.

Dear Governor Bush:

I hope this finds you and your family do well.

Not so long ago, I heard that you were going to allow teachers from one
county to transfer to other counties in Florida, without losing any
tenure.   Has this been put into effect?

As you know, my fiancé Donna, teaches fourth grade in Broward County and
she would like to relocate closer to our home but Donna does not want to
lose of any of years.  Can you let me know the status of this issue?
Right now, Palm Beach will allow you to transfer 10 but Donna has been
teaching for 12 years.

Palm Beach County has their job fair this Friday and I would like to
receive a response to this specific question by Thursday.

Best regards,

Vic Rose

Subject:	This is NOT about FR

Gov, Bush, Do you think this is fair:

(1) FOX Tv's Hannity & Colmes is reporting that several Middle Eastern men
in
Connecticut were stopped after they were found to be videotaping a water
reservoir.
They were "stopped" by the FBI because the FBI thought they were terrorists
planning
to poison the water supply. The middle eastern men politely explain they
liked the view,
and that's why they were videotape. Since enjoying a view is not against the
law, the FBI
let the men go, and that's the end of it.

CONTRAST WITH:

(2) I was stopped by police in October 2000, who mistakenly thought my
search for a destination,
and my "weaving" they claimed they witnessed, is "PROBABLY CAUSE" in this
state to arrest
me for "DUI" and driving under the influence of DRUGS OR ALCOHOL. I just
received my
order from the Civil Court Judge today in this matter who basically said
this: there is no law
in this state concerning "what" exactly is probable cause. The fact that I
had a urine test showing
NO TRACE OF ANY DRUG IN MY SYSTEM, and two police officers testified and
wrote on my
arrest report NO SMELL OF ALCOHOL ON MY BREATH, and NO DRUGS OR ANYTHING
LIKE THAT
were found on my person, purse, or my car which they impounded, all did not
"count" as much
as one cop who claimed; he is an expert, he thought I was on drugs, and his
word is enough.
The judge agreed. To me, this is terrifying news for people who actually are
recovering
addicts (I AM NOT ONE), and who could be devastated by something like
this -- a MISTAKE
by an expert, who's "WORD" is more important than the LACK OF ANY AND ALL
PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
OF ANY CRIME.

Unlike the Middle Eastern guys who are quickly let go by the FBI after they
videotape a reservoir
for "the view" -- I, a woman who is a teacher and never been arrested and do
not do drugs or alcohol,
gets put jail for 14 hours, not allowed to make a phone call, and am now
told by this judge too: Well,
too bad honey.

A cop  "thinks" your weaving was drug-related, and, so: It is, according to
this civil court, which upheld
the license suspension (the one year suspension is already over).

Gov. Bush, not tonight, but when you have a chance, I would like to fax you
this court decision. There needs
to be a clearer law in this state, requiring these cops to have PHYSICAL
EVIDENCE of drug use
when they arrest someone for it in a DUI arrest. Right now - NO PHYSICAL
EVIDENCE is required from them.
Their "word" is enough.

Again, I shudder to think what this means for someone who is a recovering
addict, and has stayed clean. Who would you believe? The cops or the
recovering addict who tells
you the cops were wrong?

Well, under current state law, you are supposed to believe the cops,
even if there was no physical evidence of drugs, drug use or anything. Just
a minor traffic violation
is ENOUGH.

I say: NOT FAIR. Not fair to me, who has not used drugs now nor in the
past -- nor is it fair to
someone like your daughter who, when NOT using, could likewise be falsely
and wrongly arrested
like I was -- and,  find herself in this same boat, with worse consequences
because of her history.

"Probable cause" requirement, prior to a DUI arrest of an individual,
needs to be amended to: "probable cause consisting of physical evidence
beyond a traffic violation."

Because right now: anyone can be arrested for "driving while under the
influence of drugs"
even when (1) there are no drugs on the person, in the person, in the
person's car or anything,
and (2) the person is not driving under the influence of drugs -- but there
is an appearance of
such, because the person may be someone suffering from a panic attack, an
anxiety attack,
a bout of depression, whatever. This is not a criminal offense. Taking a
video of a reservoir
is not a criminal offense, even though it looks like one. But the FBI is
more lenient than a city cop
in this state. Seriously.

I will fax you this court decision on Saturday, and a brief letter less
emotional than this. It is
frightening to think the police in this state can just "say" a person
"looks" like her depression/anxiety/panic
is drug use - AND THE COURT SAYS: YEAH, THEY CAN JUST SAY IT. NO PHYSICAL
EVIDENCE
NEEDED.

Thank you if you read this.

Susan

   Hey Jeb!
     I received this (below) from Charlotte Greenbarg who you know is the state chairwoman of IVBE. You've also known me long enough now to know my opinion of School To Work style education and how I believe it has been a waste of tax dollars.
     Jeb, I am again not pleased with the 2002 FCAT results.
     I don't believe these results have anything to do with your education reform efforts. 
     The problem (IMO) lies in inadequate "fuzzy" curriculum, undertrained teachers and liberal socially engineered classroom practices. Our generation has adopted the "make the child feel good at all costs" philosophy and it is taking its toll.
     I know your efforts are absolutely the best thing to ever have happened in this state to shake-up the monopoly of public education. 
     The problem is not what you are doing in Tallahassee...its what is STILL going on in the classroom.
     For instance, every Friday, during her entire 7th grade year, (this year) my daughter Arielle has watched a movie in her science class. The teacher sits in the back of the class dozing off and eating. There is not a quiz on the movie...even though they are "science" movies. It is basically a waste of classtime IMO...but even I. like many other parents run out of eneregy to keep up the level of our complaints.
      Anyway, please read the message below. Thanks Jeb.  Shelley

Subject:	Tech Bill Signing

Governor,

Slater just told me that you had some concerns about our choice of locations
for the bill signing on Wednesday.  We were originally scheduled to do one
in Tampa with Chris Hart and one in Jacksonville with Jim King.  The event
in Jacksonville, however, is part of another scheduled event with the
opening of the Advanced Technology Center of the Florida Community College.
King, Hart, Klein, and Connie Mack all are either out of the state or out of
the country on the 22nd.  We are getting no bang for our buck with
legislators.  We were already going to be in Tampa for the Hurricane
Awareness Conference, and so we were concerned about a lack of press at the
bill signing.  With no legislators and concerns about no press, we cancelled
the event in Tampa before our conference with you this morning, and we
decided to keep the one in Jacksonville on the schedule because it was part
of an event that you were scheduled to attend with or without the bill
signing component.

However, you rightly noted, Chief, that this is a major victory that we need
to be holding high during these bill signings, and that is why we made the
move to put Orlando on the schedule.  I believe that the event in Orlando
will be a good one, and we will still have you home by 5:30.  If you need us
to revisit, we will definitely do so.

Gov. Bush.

I am sorry about writing you last night, but I was so upset
that an unlawful arrest was upheld by the court.

I reread the statutes and have decided to appeal to the
next level of the court, even if I lose again. I'm not going to bother
faxing this to you yet. However,  what happened to me was really wrong and
unjust.

Also -- I hope you will share the following statute information in the
future, at some point,
with your daughter, because this is where I was really mistreated by police.

FL law, below, gives me a certain right, which the police did not give me:

"The law enforcement officer shall not interfere with
the person's opportunity to obtain the independent [urine] test and shall
provide the person with timely
telephone access to secure the test, but the burden is on the person to
arrange and secure the
test at the person's own expense."

Now, here is a fact: I knew I was not on drugs or alcohol, so I did ask to
use the phone,
immediately. And, they would not let me, For 14 hours they kept me
incarcerated, without
access to a phone, but when I did finally get to use the phone, I posted
bail and immediately
went and took an independent urine test. Yet, the police had no right to
interfer with my
right, by state law, to take that urine test ASAP.

I hope you will tell your daughter someday that she has the right to request
that. Even if they
deny her, like they did me, and tried to interfer with proof of innocence in
an unlawful arrest.

Why the court did not give greater weight to physical evidence of a urine
test, showing NO TRACE
of anything, as opposed to a cop's word of the appearance of drug use,
remains a mystery to me,
but I will appeal to the next level and keep trying.

Thanks, and again, sorry to bother you with this. But it is frightening how
this system works
when a person is not guilty.

Susan

CAPE Update -- May 20, 2002

NATIONAL MOMENT OF REMEMBRANCE

The following is a letter to educators from Secretary of Education Rod Paige
regarding the National Moment of Remembrance to be observed on Memorial Day,
May 27.

-----------------------------

Dear Educators:

The White House Commission on the National Moment of Remembrance was
established by Congress to put the "memorial" back in Memorial Day.
Unfortunately, too many Americans have lost sight of the meaning of the
holiday.  In fact, the idea of the Moment was born in 1996 when children
touring our Nation's capital were asked what Memorial Day means and
responded, "That's the day the pools open."

As a member of the Commission, I am writing to ask for your support to
reclaim this noble holiday for its intended purpose of honoring those who
died in service to our great country.  On Memorial Day, May 27, a National
Moment of Remembrance will be observed by Americans everywhere at 3:00 p.m.
local time.  The theme is "One Nation, One Moment."  We need your help to
gain the broadest possible awareness and participation among young people.

Please let teachers and students know about the opportunity to participate
in a new American tradition simply by pausing wherever they may be at 3:00
p.m. for one minute to reflect on our fallen heroes.  They can encourage
their families and friends to join them.  The activities they are enjoying
on the holiday reflect the freedoms guaranteed by the sacrifices of the men
and women who gave their lives.  If they are driving at 3:00 p.m., they can
simply turn on their vehicle's headlights.

For schools that are still in session after the holiday, teachers can ask
students to recount how they observed the Moment.  This may be appropriate
to integrate into end-of-year classes and activities.

A variety of tools, including the Remembrance poster, are available to
download at the official website, www.remember.gov.  Click the "Download
Media" menu on the left side of the main page, and the poster is at the top
of the page under Artwork - it's the third file, National Moment of
Remembrance Poster Art.  You and your students are encouraged to download
and distribute the items as needed.

I hope that all educators and students will join with the President and me
in encouraging all Americans to honor the men and women who died in service
to our Nation and left us a legacy of service, a heritage of sacrifice, and
the gift of freedom.  Let us never forget.

Thank you for your support and participation.

Sincerely,

Rod Paige

The state pays for four "brand name" medications per month for medicaid
recipients.  There is no limit placed on the number of "generic" meds a
patient can receive.  Some generic manufacturers give their meds their
own "trade name."  Rugby pharmaceuticals is (was) the champion of this
practice.  Here is the problem.  Medicaid is treating these "branded
generics" as true "brand name" products and counting them against the
limit of four per month.  This should not be as the branded generics are
not true brand name products, and are generally as inexpensive as the
non-branded generic products.  Someone needs to look into this as soon
as possible.  Is there a "consultant job" here for me??????  You need
someone (a pharmacist) to assist here.  Later....................bob

Spoke with Sheriff Rider and Chief Holley.  Both confirmed that their
meeting with the local INS folks went well.  It was very positive and they
are moving forward with the building of the facility.  While they received
no written agreement, they did receive a verbal agreement.  
Their bond underwriters are secured and they are shooting for a July 11
deadline for having all the bonds sold and a closing date of July 30.  
The county commission has signed off on the land purchase.  They are
currently working on the interlocal agreement.
Sheriff Rider heard from Donald in Sen. Nelson's office.  Donald told the
Sheriff that Senator Nelson is meeting with James Zigler within the next few
weeks and will bring the situation up.

Sorry---long but important.

The Governor should get all the credit.  I have been meaning to write....10
days ago I called the Miami INS Director's office and spoke with his COS,
John Shewairy, to talk about the Glades County facility.

Glades County-INS detention facility

I explained the Glades County situation, including the personal e-mails from
the Gov, the calls we receive from Sheriff Ryder and National INS, and the
calls we were getting from Congress Foley's office.  We were not making
progress with the National INS office and I thought that working with the
District Office might prove more helpful.  John promised to look into the
situation and meet with the Glades County officials.

John Shewairy called back last week----at our request, he and his team met
with Chief Ken Holley (I believe Sheriff Ryder's deputy) on 5/9-----John
reported that the meeting went very well.  INS cannot, legally, give Glades
a contractual promise to use the facility and Glades understands this...and
although there are no promises, John explained that all indications are that
there is a need for the facility and given the community's willingness,
interest, etc, the hope would be that if a facility were built...it will be
used.  But, this is not w/out risk.  If the community decides to build the
facility (they already have $30K in sunk costs), they will be making the
decision to assume the risk.  Apparently everyone went home happy.

Iberia/Aviation

While I had John on the phone I asked him to look into the Iberia
Customs/INS issue.  I explained our prior discussions with Customs
Commissioner Bonner's COS and told him about the Governor's letter.  I
explained that our airport team was telling us that it was truly an INS
problem and not Customs.  He jumped at the chance to help and promised to
get back.  He knew the issue and players.  This was last Thursday.  He has
yet to call me....my guess is that you're hearing about his efforts before
he's had a chance to call me back.  I think I should get confirmation from
John prior to a press release...we would hate to backtrack.  I will call him
this morning.

Dear Pam

Wonderful news ! I just spoke to Miguel Southwell and it appears that INS
and MIA have reached an accord on the in transit passengers  that so far is
acceptable to all airlines. He is awaiting to talk to the front person from
American Airlines who is out until tomorrow to finalize the deal but expects
it will work out.

Miguel and the MIA people give full credit to Governor Bush for making the
resolution of this problem possible. As soon as I receive word tomorrow I
will let you know and strongly recommend that Governor Bush then call Peter
Delara of American and Enrique Donaire. I am sure both Iberia and American
will be very grateful.

I can also help  with whomever you indicate towards producing a press
release and link them with the airport people for appropriate commentary.
This is a very significant coup for Florida Aviation !!

Dear Pam



I just had a lengthy conversation with Ana Sotorrio of MIA on this issue and
she strongly feels that the Governor's intervention could be decisive in
obtaining a favorable resolution on the INS issue and resolving this problem
for our air carriers. She feels that a letter from the Governor to the INS
Commissioner accompanied by a phone call from the Washington office or
yourself, should provide the needed nudge to get INS to reach agreement with
MIA.

It is a time sensitive issue since they would like to see this issue
resolved by May 15th which is the start of the summer travel season. If you
would like I can start working on a draft along the lines of what we wrote
for the US Customs Commissioner for the INS Commissioner. Let me know.

Unfortunately, Pam, it didn't go at all.  Once again, INS was not available
to meet with us.  It was not until this morning that Miguel Southwell met
with Mr. Jack Garafano, INS Miami District Director, and Port Director Jorge
Roig.  Mr. Garafano claims that he has not seen the Department of Justice
Memorandum for Regional Directors regarding ITI Transit and Progressive
Clearance Procedures, which was issued on April 22,2002.  We gave him a copy
and could not move the conversation beyond the first line of the section of
the memo on ITI Flights, which states "The carrier must provide 100% Advance
Passenger Information (API) electronic data in advance of the aircraft's
arrival."  Mr. Garafano interprets this to mean that air carriers must be
100% APIS compliant. No airline is 100% APIS compliant.  Mr. Garafano's
interpretation is not consistent with ours, or Customs, or the airlines, or
anybody else who understands these issues and has seen the document.  Mr.
Garafano said he needs to review the memo carefully and then call
headquarters.  In the meantime, we are also attempting to get clarification
from INS headquarters.

If we can get beyond this issue, the next battle with INS will be about
facilities and technology.  Our ITI lounges do not contain INS-approved
inspection booths, nor does the capability exist to conduct IBIS computer
queries.  We can provide the booths and IBIS capability in the future, but
not in time for the peak summer travel season.  At our meeting in
Washington, we were led to believe that INS would work with us on interim
solutions, but given our current experience with INS we are less than
confident that this will be the case.

We could use your help in getting INS Headquarters to clarify the APIS
issue.  We and the airlines interpret the requirement to be 100%
transmission of APIS electronic data - 100% APIS compliance is quite
different and not attainable.

We are still trying to implement the full modified procedures on May 15.
Without INS's cooperation, this will not be possible.  Please call me at
305-876-7533 to discuss this in greater detail.  Thank you.

Dear Mr. Heacock,

Thank you so much for taking the time to e-mail me about your experiences
with DCF and with Mr. Goldson.  It is often difficult to find good in
situations like the one we are facing in Miami at the present time -- but
e-mails like yours put it all into perspective.  There are many competent
and compassionate child welfare workers employed by DCF and our
community-based partners.  They are grieving at this time over the loss of
Rilya and over the media's trivialization of their hard work and efforts to
improve a system that was beyond broken.  Your words inspire all of us to
stay focussed on the task at hand -- protecting Florida's children from
abuse and neglect, and finding them permanent, loving homes such as yours.
Thank you so much for your support of District 10 and the fine men and
women that dedicate their lives to work there.

Dear Mr. Moss,

I have been closely following the slings and arrows launched at DCF in the
aftermath of the Rilya Wilson case.  I also read the article in the Miami
Herald regarding Broward's efforts to encourage local adoption by reducing
the
bureaucracy and speeding the process up.  I applaud that effort because we
both know it is a burdensome process, albeit a process designed to ensure
correct adoptive decisions are made.

I am the father in one of your pre-adoptive families in Broward, my wife
and
I having signed the application and submitted it to DCF just last month.
Having followed the Rilya Wilson situation, I thought I'd take a moment to
remind you and others that there are dedicated and responsive caseworkers
in
your organization.  I have one assigned to my case: Horace Goldson.  Mr.
Goldson has quickly become an ally in our efforts to make the proper
decision about adoption.  He is the kind of caseworker I think the
Department of Children and Families would want to recognize in some way for
dedication to his job, his authentic concern for the children he is
responsible for, and his responsiveness to the needs or questions of the
prospective family.  It doesn't take long to realize that Mr. Goldson is
truly interested in doing what is right for the families and the children
with which he is entrusted.  Mr. Goldson never fails to make his monthly
visits and his visits are not cursory stops.  He spends time with the
children and with members of my biological family.  His presence in our
home
is never an imposition and we are truly grateful for the efforts he expends
on behalf of the children we are adopting, ourselves, and the other
families
fortunate enough to have him assigned to their cases.

It's easy to kick an organization when it stumbles and there has been no
shortage of those seizing the opportunity to do just that.  The Miami
Herald
contained another article about comments made by politicians at the
proceedings of the Blue Ribbon panel directed specifically at Secretary
Kearney, shamelessly designed for political gain rather than improving the
system.  I may lack the public forum that the Miami Herald and some
transparent politicians enjoy, but I hope the feedback from the people you
serve mean far more than the frenzied rants from the media.  You have good
people in your organization and I hope you can take some solace in the
knowledge that to those who matter the most, we are grateful for them and
your efforts.

There is a letter in support of TPA being circulated for signatures.  At the moment only Governors Johanns (R-NE) and Hoeven (R-ND) have signed-on; they are leading this effort.  Although they’re off to a slow start, they are hoping to get 20 bi-partisan signatures.  They would like to send the letter Wed morning….a vote is likely in the Senate on Thursday.
 
We have been working with the citrus industry on a TPA amendment.  They understand the Gov’s support for TPA but want citrus off the tariff reduction table.  This morning Andy LeVigne made it clear that the industry would work w/ Sen Nelson on the Nelson/Graham amendment; last Friday, citrus rejected a WH compromise…saying they did not want to “assume tariff reductions.”  They want no tariff reductions.
 
The letter is attached and copied below.
 
Dear (House and Senate Leadership):

We are writing in strong support of current legislation restoring permanent 
Presidential Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) that is vital to America, the states, its workers, families and businesses.

With many difficult challenges facing our country both domestic and abroad, 
TPA will go a long way in expanding consumer confidence, spurring economic 
growth and opportunities, creating high paying jobs, and providing a high 
quality of life for our citizens.

For too long, the United States has been limited and unable to negotiate and enter into trade agreements with other countries because of the absence of TPA.  Trade agreements between the United States and other countries address many issues and do not occur overnight, but, rather, are the result of long deliberative 
negations.  TPA will restore Presidential authority to negotiate fair and 
balanced agreements that open markets and bring down trade barriers, while 
maintaining congressional oversight and authority to review trade agreements 
and either accept or reject them based on their merits.

This is not a partisan issue, but rather an American issue with Governors in 
unified support of clean TPA legislation that will stimulate our economies 
and enhance America's position as a global leader.

Restore Trade Promotion Authority.

Sincerely,

This will be a great source of info on the perceptions of the foster
parents and the system in general. I think this will give us the ability to
keep a finger on the pulse of out of home care, worker performance and give
an outlet for frustrations before they rise to the boiling point. Will give
us a chance to dispel myths, get feedback, understand where they are coming
from and monitor our performance.Trudy is a great supporter of the
administration and DCF in general. She is positive and exhibits great
common sense. The other foster parents respect her statewide. Hopefully we
can institute this statewide in an effort to show the DCF is truly not
hiding anything and welcomes the input from these valued partners. ( my 2
cents worth). A great result of the panel, one that is free, can be

  This was our idea.  So I now need to put some "meat on the bones" of this
idea!  We are looking to have 6 foster parents and administration sit
monthly to discuss the issues of intimidation, lack of visitation,
falsified information, lack of information, things like that.  If there is
a particular case and counselor this would be investigated by the
administration and reported back to the board and the foster parent.  We
want to be able to present issues, wide and specific, and get results!

  We want to use this as a means of communication also.  Like many of us
complained about the Unit Rilya was in but it went no place.  Also there is
a new Electronic Blue Book with the children's information...of course we
knew nothing about it...where was our input?

  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Honorable Jeb Bush
Governor of the State of Florida
 
This letter comes to you from the heart of a mother.  My daughter, Michelle Bolin, is a Florida State prison inmate.  She is a paraplegic.  This is a result of the traffic accident she caused.  She was convicted of DUI manslaughter and sentenced to 15 years in prison in 1997.  Because of extremely negligent medical care she is now serving a death sentence.
 
Michelle was married and had two little girls who are now 9 and 8.  Their father has custody of them and is doing a great job of raising and caring for them as a single father.
 
Michelle's problem was addiction to drugs.  She would drink alcohol to enhance the effects of the drugs.  This was her condition the day of the accident.
 
Michelle and I both know that justice must be served for her crime.  For that reason we are not asking for anything but reasonable and adequate medical care so that she might survive her sentence and come home.
 
Her major medical problems began in September of 1999 when she was transferred to Lowell Correctional Institute in Ocala, Florida.  While there, she has had to have surgery for a colostomy, a permanent catheter, and developed decubitus ulcers on her buttocks.  These ulcers developed because of pressure from sitting too long in her  wheelchair.  (Her chair is custom made for her).  Because of her medical problems she has to see the prison doctor almost daily.  She is forced to sit and wait for hours  to see the doctor for so much as an aspirin.  She has lain and sat in her own urine because her catheter leaks.  This causes further infection which leads to pseudomonas infection which causes death.
 
The staff at Lowell are unable to care for her medical needs and have contributed further to her problems with unsanitary practices.  They have at times not worn gloves when changing her dressings and, at times left some of the old packing in the wound.
 
Michelle has twice been transferred to North Florida Reception Center (NFRC), which is a men's prison with a hospital facility, because of her medical condition.  She is currently housed at NFRC with large decubitus ulcers on both sides of her buttocks.  She has now developed osteomilytis, a bone infection, and a hole in her intestines.
 
Michelle has had four surgeries to close these ulcers since 1999.  This current situation is the worst yet.  This ulcer developed while at Lowell early this year.  In February the plastic surgeon, Dr. Obie, told her it needed to be closed right away in order to prevent enlargement and infection.  At that time she still had enough good tissue on her buttocks to use for the procedure.  That is in doubt now.  The previous surgeries have used all of the available muscle tissue for a muscle flap procedure to close the sores.
 
The medical staff at Lowell was supposed to transfer her back to NFRC for this procedure in April but  there was always an excuse.  "The van broke down" is a favorite.  After 8 missed appointments, I called the Regional Director of impaired inmates, Dr. Diane Rechtine.  After hearing the problem, she immediately ordered an ambulance transfer to NFRC.  It is now May 16, and still nothing has been done.  The ulcers on her behind are now down to the bone.  A staff member called me, jeopardizing her job,  to tell me that Michelle is in very bad shape and even urged me to get an attorney.  The medical staff at NFRC said that Michelle has too many doctors involved in her case and cancelled the plastic surgeon, the very doctor she needs the most.  I don't understand this and no one will give me or Michelle any answers.
 
I have spoken with Mr. Emile Baudoin, Coordinator of impaired inmates, several times and he has assured me he would look into the problems but nothing changes.
 
Michelle's custom made wheelchair needed repairs in January.  She had to write a grievance to get the repairs and it still has not been repaired.  Her chair helps to relieve the pressure on her spine when sitting for prolonged periods.  The chair is still at Lowell.  It should have been fixed and transferred with her.
 
These problems just scratch the surface.  Michelle's medical records cover seven volumes.
 
Governor Bush, from one parent to another, I am asking for your help and or guidance to save my daughter's life.
 
There are only two women's prisons in Florida, Lantana in South Florida and Lowell in North Florida.  Can she possibly be transferred to some facility here in Northwest Florida such as a county jail or correctional facility?  There is no state prison for women in Nothwest Florida, but there is certainly a need for one.
 
I was told today that if someone does not help Michelle soon, she will die.  
 
I am not asking for Michelle's sentence to be reduced or for an early release.  I only ask that she be accorded the human and humane treatment that she has been refused.
 
Thank you for listening.

I was so impressed with Phyllis Hunter at the Reading Summit. I would
like
to contact her to come to Naples for our focus on literacy and wondered
if
you had thought about her as part of the March literacy event. She would
be
a great speaker for teachers and community and we could incorporate her
at a
local level prior to the event. 


The Consortium of Florida Education Foundations did not do well with the
funding in the budget and we managed to find about 700,000 for our
matching
funds that were an extension of the 99A low performing schools dollars.
Do
you have some more opportunties for our local foundations to match some
of
your reading dollars and how can we help to double the dollars that  you
have? We are the best link to those corporate sponsors in each county to
help their children read. We are a network that can manage and bring
accountability to a matching fund program that will benefit K-12. I
appreciate your support for our organizations

Subject:	Cynthia Szuka

Dear Governor Bush:
Thank you so much for taking your time out of your busy schedule and together with Mrs. Bush attending the Family Cafe. We are writing to you again, regarding the problem in District 9 and the wheelchair that our daughter Cynthia needs and was recommended by her doctor. Following the CMAT meeting held in District 9 on Thursday May 16th and because of what transpired in that meeting, Cynthia was ill. Cynthia has a history of asthma and had not had an episode in a long time. She was so upset and discouraged that she had an asthmatic episode and I had to give her her asthma medication throughout the following days, which she had not had in a long time. She was also very depressed and anxious the days that followed. The CMAT team did not recognize her prescence in that meeting, and we left with a strong belief that Cynthia's welfare and health is not in their agenda, that we were decieved. Cynthia has had 2 evaluations completed, per Medicaid guidelines with all the paperwork and detailed letter of medical necessity by her othopedic doctor and surgeon ( approved Medicaid and CMS doctor). The wheelchair specialist came to our home and brought a DEMO wheelchair in which Cynthia drove around the house, stood on it, reclined, they also evaluated our van to make sure it fit in it. There is no question that Cynthia can operate this wheelchair, no question that it fits in the home, no question that it fits in the van, no question that it will help her get better, be independent, be healthy, have her life.The CMAT team continues to insist upon yet another evaluation, with Cynthia present, in their office not Cynthia's home, with the same people that made her so ill at the 5/16 meeting... for what reason??? Mr. John Grocki had suggested that we as Cynthia's parents meet with the CMAT without Cynthia there, including Cynthia's doctor and clarify the concerns, we as Cynthia's parents have no probem with this suggestion; however CMS does not want to do this. CMS wants Cynthia and her mother in their office, at their appointed date and time neglecting the fact that it poses a health hazard for Cynthia being placed into this situation with the experience she has had at the CMAT meeting, and her past experiences at this same CMS office. Neglecting the fact that Cynthia goes to school and these last two weeks are crucial with exams and finals, and what it would mean for Cynthia to miss school, neglecting the fact that her mother works and asked two days off last week for this same issue and cannot just... not go to work. Cynthia's mother and father have no problem in meeting with these people as soon as possible, at a time best for all; however after so many evaluations and doctor recommendations, there is no need to subject Cynthia to yet another horrific experience for her that may leave her ill.We appreciate Mr. John Grocki's efforts in resolving this issue, although he is not directly involved, however tried to get the facts from both sides and come up with a solution.Mr. Grocki did disclose that the funds for Cynthia's wheelchair was not an issue as he saw it. But at the same time we are not pressing Medicaid to pay, we are only looking at Cynthia's health. The unfortunate thing is that the CMAT team is inflexible, says one thing and does another, and we are very upset and concerned. Knowing what we know now to be a medical necessity for Cynthia, to be healthy and live and impact others and be happy, what type of parents would we be if we were to neglect this fact. We will go to the community, to the media if needed and not look at the money factor but at the medical needs for her well being and the needs for her to have this type of wheelchair. We continue to support you and believe in your message as well as your actions and are looking to you and those you have assigned in helping us with this crucial and unfortunate issue.We appreciate you. With deep concerns, Juan and Alicia Szuka

Subject: Call from DOJ re Miami
Importance: High


I received a call today from Sharee Freeman, head of DOJ--Community Relations Services.  As Sherrie put it, this is the office that handles riots, KKK, Black Panther, police shootings, etc. (Sharee used to work with Chairman Hyde, House Judiciary.)
 
This weekend is "Miami Black Beach Reunion Weekend."  Apparently in the past a criminal element comes in and makes a mess of the weekend....destruction of property, little riots, etc. DOJ has been working w/ the community---police, God Squad, other volunteers---and Congressional Offices (Meek, Graham, Nelson) to have control over the celebrations and keep the criminal element in check. 
 
There will be a DOJ Briefing this Friday, May 24th at 7:00 pm.  Sherrie says these briefings are very impressive...will show how much coordination and effort goes into the event.  Local police Congressional staff from Meek, Graham and Nelson's offices will attend----DOJ wanted to make sure we had representation at the briefing.  
 
I've tried to reach Andriena...and have left messages.   I also alerted Al Dennis, Community Relations w/ FDLE.  For more details, our DOJ contact is Francis Nam 202/305-3001.  Andriena, Al, feel free to call her.  I think it's important that we have representation at the briefing Francis can give you location and other details.  Thanks.  Nina.

I just heard on the radio Governor Bush's advertisement promoting Florida

Whoever thought of THAT idea was so innovative...IT IS GREAT!!! and it
surely makes me SMILE!!!  Last week I heard the want promoting the different
types of SUN; today I heard the one about different types of SAND.
I love vacationing in Florida (Beaches, sand, sun, Disney etc......) and
that commercial just reminds me of fun times my family and I have had while
vacationing in Florida......(my childhood, my children growing up and now my
grandchildren)

Thank you for bringing a smile to me so early in the day!!!!!!    ;-)

OLYMPIA - As it nears the end of a months-long check into employee
backgrounds, the state Department of Social and Health Services said
yesterday it has found 71 workers with criminal histories that could cost
them their jobs. 


But department officials predicted that when further reviews are done, fewer
than half of those people will be forced out of their current jobs. So far,
four people with criminal pasts have been terminated, and possible action
against 16 others is pending. Seven employees have resigned. 


As required under a law passed last year, the state is checking the
background of all employees who have "unsupervised contact" with children,
the elderly and other vulnerable people. 


The department has refused to reveal the names or jobs of any employees
found with criminal pasts. Officials said they will not release the
information until the review, including appeals by employees, is completed. 


Aside from identifying criminal pasts of current employees, the law requires
applicants to undergo background checks. That will make it harder for people
with criminal pasts to get hired in the first place, said DSHS Secretary
Dennis Braddock. "It has definitely made people more sensitive about the
protection of our clients," he said yesterday. 


Since February, the department has released the results of background checks
on 13,314 employees. Three-fourths were in three agencies: Children's
Administration, Division of Developmental Disabilities and the Mental Health
Division. 


The department has only 40 employees left to check, all of them at Western
State Hospital, a psychiatric facility. The department expects to have that
done by next month. 


Through three rounds of background checks, including the latest released
yesterday, the department has found 204 workers with criminal records. Their
crimes included murder, manslaughter, child molestation, prostitution,
arson, forgery and drug offenses. 


Of those employees, 133 were able to prove that their background checks were
inaccurate, that they had been misidentified or that their records had been
cleared, said department spokesman Steve Williams. 


He said seven employees found to have criminal pasts resigned instead of
taking their cases to the Background Assessment Review Team. 


Braddock predicted yesterday that of the 71 remaining cases of employees
with criminal histories, only 20 to 30 will be terminated or reassigned to
other jobs. Workers who are forced out of their jobs can appeal those
decisions to the state's Personnel Appeals Board.

I was a service counselor who gave my all. when I worked for the Department, which went unappreciated. I would expect that the Department never give out my personal information in the future. I am not a free service for what you all need to take care of yourselves. This family is in need of services, get it for them! I am no longer an employee. 
Thank you for never taking it upon yourself to offer my services.
Sincerely,
Mary Pringle

In a backdoor move, the Government Nanny bill was attached to S.B. 1844 at
the eleventh hour and passed by both the Florida senate and the house. Many
house members, who had earlier rejected the Government Nanny bill when it
stood alone, voted for S.B. 1844, unaware that the Government Nanny bill was
added on at the last minute.

Jeb,
I hope you VETO this Big Government Nanny Bill attached to SB 1844.  We DO
NOT need more government meddling.

Subject:	Dr. Medows at AHCA

Dear Governor Bush: 

Several friends on your staff have indicated you may have the opportunity to read this note, and have encouraged me to write.  I am writing this evening regarding an egregious abuse of the Service First Initiative by Secretary Medows at AHCA.   

Prior to being recruited to Florida in 1992 by the Governor's Office, I was Director of Texas Governor Bill Clements Washington Office.  As part of Lawton Chiles staff, I was a policy coordinator/Intergovernmental Affairs Director within EOG/OPB for nearly six years before moving to AHCA in 1997.  Both Tom Herndon and Doug Cook 
can verify the quality of my work.  At AHCA I held several positions including Senior Analyst and Health Policy Chief of Staff, and had an outstanding record of accomplishment as evidenced by Special Recognition Awards, Davis Awards, promotions, bonuses and excellent performance reviews. 

On August 3, 2001, Dr. Medows started at AHCA, and, after checking with Agency executives appointed me to the position of Bureau Chief of Health Policy.  Several weeks later, I was told the title would temporarily be "Acting Bureau Chief" until all the paperwork was completed and sent through your office.  A mere formality.  I would have been very proud to serve in your Administration in this capacity.  However, on September 21, 2001, I was advised that I was not going to be the Bureau Chief.  The reason cited by Dr. Medows was the need to place someone in my position from the Governor's Office (i.e., Emily Fritz) and the fact that your staff (i.e., Laura Branker) objected to appointing someone that have worked for the previous Administration.  I have never been political, but I accepted that decision. 

Several months earlier, on July 1, 2001, my career service position at AHCA had been involuntarily changed to an SES position.  Thus, the result of the September 21 action by Dr. Medows to place me back in career service had the effect of placing me "on probation" for one year as provided by Service First, even though I had achieved permanent status in that position long ago. 

On January 9, 2002, (three months later) I was terminated from my position.  There was no cause cited, merely a letter stating that I had "failed to successfully complete my probationary period."  It also said it was effective at 5pm that day. 
I have been without a job since that time and my excellent work record has been damaged.  There had been no review or any other indication that this action was imminent prior to termination.   

As you can imagine, this termination has been devastating to both me and my family.  Secretary Medows refuses to discuss her actions, even with members of the Senate who know me and have attempted to receive information on this matter. 

In my view, terminating an accomplished employee on an alleged technicality for no stated reason is an abuse of the system, and I'm certain this was not your intent when signing this measure into law. 

I am requesting your help Governor.  I would like to be (truly need to be) reinstated as soon as possible and would appreciate any assistance you may be able to render.  I will provide a copy of this memo along with supplemental material to Betty Hampton, and request that it be placed in your reading file. 

Thank you so much, 

Bob Reinshuttle

Governor, 

I just thought I would let you know that Anderson Columbia has applied to
modify it's Ichetucknee Mine permit that is adjacent to the
under-construction Cement Plant.  The original intent of the mine at this
location was for minimal amount of limestone to assist in the burning
process.  The request was for 100 acres and down to 70 feet deep.

Anderson Columbia now has applied to modify that permit to encompass 800
acres and 125 feet deep.  DEP says that it is harmless.  The mine is not in
the same watershed as the Ichetucknee River.  And in the words of our
secretary it could be 1000 feet deep and it wouldn't harm the Ichetucknee. 

If you recall, that is was announced at the Cabinet meeting by one of the
environmentalists that this original permit request existed and that the DEP
and the Company kept responding that "the mine was a small one, it was only
100 acres, only 70 feet deep, it's not in the same watershed."  This seemed
to damper the opposition on that issue. 

But now, if DEP approves this permit modification, we will never hear the
end of it, I fear. 

Can we talk about this with David?

Subject: [PaycheckGroup] Colorado House Kills Anti-Paycheck Bill

FYI, the Colorado House of Representatives has killed SB 171, a union-supported bill that would have overturned Governor Bill Owens' 2001 Executive Order putting an end to payroll deductions for state employee union dues.
 
Here's a description of the impact of Governor Owens' Executive Order from his speech to CPAC:
 
...we stopped withholding dues from Colorado's 30,000 employees. We stopped withholding union dues in the State of Colorado. This affected unions such as the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; the American Federation of Teachers; and the Colorado Association of Public Employees. In just 60 days, the impact has been very dramatic. It is interesting what happens when you require the unions to be very upfront and direct in terms of asking for the $300 or $400 a year they typically exact in terms of their membership. 
 
Here is what has happened to our largest non-education union, the Colorado Association of Public Employees -- in just 60 days, they have lost 70 percent of their members. 
 
They have had to lay off all 17 of their field workers. And what is important here is just the principle. Why should government be withholding these dues? Why not have the union do it itself? And I think you can see the impact on the union membership structure when you simply do the right thing as we are doing in Colorado. 
 
Thanks,
Ron

Dear Jeb,
I just received a telephone call from a client from years ago where I had to deal with some serious issues. Apparently this client is in trouble again. The personal office at the Department District Eight (Lydia Lowell-Sherman) gave out my home telephone number which is unlisted to this client. Lydia was getting her hair done and got involved in a conversation about me. Another employee let Lydia know my name is now Pringle not Nunley so she followed up by getting this client my personal telephone number out of my file at the Department. This is serious and needs to be taken care of immediately. I do not like being put in a situation like this at all. Please forward this to whom ever is in charge down here at this time.
Thank you for following up on this. I do  not want this to happen again.
I know you understand.

Dear Sirs, 
      My husband and I are trying to adopt four siblings that are currently living in a foster home in Miami run by Hazel Langston.  The children's names are Mary, LaPorsha, Steven and Darcella.  Their worker is Lavata King. 
      We were foster parents for 6 years, and then adopted four special needs children from Florida's DCF.  We also have three biological children.  Three of our adopted children came from District 11 in Miami, and two of them were living in Mrs. Langston's foster home, so our adopted children are good friends with these new children that we would like to adopt.  If we do not adopt these four, Ms. King has told me that she will split up the siblings, and has already started placement proceedings for the younger two to be adopted separately. 
      Although we are ready and willing to adopt these siblings and keep them together, we are being told by Ms. King's supervisor, Lita Fowler, and her supervisor, Ada Gonzales, that we cannot adopt them because we already have too many children.  While I agree that having such a large family is not for everyone, my husband and I believe that we are more than capable of parenting these children. 
      We have filed a grievance with Janice Harris and with Charles Oslander in Miami, but as of today, we still have heard no response. 
      We look forward to any help that you could give us in this matter. 

      Thank you for your time.

Dear Secretary Harris,

I have been informed that you have contracted with an out of state
production company for production of  a video on Political History and
Governance in Florida when our own, world renowned, superior  production
infrastructure is begging for work. Not only was your decision to go out
of state an absolute contradiction to  your assurances to members of
Florida's production community at the Langford Hotel in Winter Park, but
it flies in the face of Governor Bush's assurances to us that state
production would stay in the state.

You may or may not be aware (probably not, you seem maze dull with
respect to Florida's entertainment production industry), but I publish
the Florida Blue Sheet, the primary trade publication for the industry in
Florida and throughout the south. Our 20,000+ readers represent both rank
and file members of the industry and the principal industry leaders. Ours
is a small voice, but it is one heard by many  big, loud, and commanding
voices. As the only Florida publication of any kind that circulates to
all 50 states and to 15 foreign countries, you may be sure that your
flagrant betrayal of our industry will be trumpeted  not only throughout
the state, including the district you seek to represent in Congress, but
throughout the country.

This was a major and foolish blunder, Secretary Harris. Cancel the
contract with the Washington interlopers immediately and award it to a
Florida company, or suffer the consequences politically. You have chosen
to pick a fight with a group of people whose voices are measured in
megahertz and who buy ink by the barrel. Is this a fight you really want?
Florida production is to be done by Florida companies. That was your
avowed mandate. That was the assurance of the Governor.

Hello Governor,
Well you and your brother certainly wowed us in Miami yesterday!
Congratulations on a wonderful event, and also thanks and congratulations to
you and your staff for all the hard work in bringing us through the very
difficult legislative process this year.  All in all, I think everyone can
return home proud of the work that was accomplished under  trying
circumstances, but you deserve much of the kudos for bringing players to the
table and reaching consensus.  Now, on to the 2002 election!

Also, as the newly elected chairman of the Florida Inland Navigation
District Commission, I wanted to bring to your attention an issue dealing
with a pending appointment to this agency.  One of your 1999 appointees to
the commission, Ji-Ang Song, an engineer from West Palm Beach, has recently
had to resign his post due to a conflict with a new job.  That leaves the
Palm Beach County seat vacant as we enter a crucial time of the year when we
develop and adopt our FY2002-03 budget.  Although our annual budget is
rather small by comparison to other agencies ($40 million, and we have
managed to hold it to roll back rates for the past several years), it
nonetheless does involve a number of local cost share projects in each of
our eleven counties.  As such, I suspect that Palm Beach County would
benefit from having a newly appointed commissioner looking after their
interests in this process.  I understand that you have several highly
qualified applicants pending at this time, and with all due respect, would
like to call your attention to their interest in the commission appointment.
Thank you!  I look forward to seeing you soon,

Subject:	good news - police are helping me change the law

Gov. Bush,.

I just had to quickly tell you this good news --
today I did something to prevent what happened to me
with that false, wrong and mistaken DUI arrest from happening to others.

I remembered that in NY, when I was going through a rough time,
the people who helped me most and were honest were two Community Police
officers.

So, today I went to see the head of the Community Police for Collier. And, I
told
him, I have a situation that is a lemon, and I would like him to help me
make some
lemonade out of it. And, he was very interested.

He met with me in his office for a long time, listened to my whole sorry
saga, and then,
I showed him that law I wrote to you about last night, where people are
allowed to
call and get an independent blood or urine test AT THE TIME OF ARREST.

He looked up the law, highlighted it, and said: This info needs to be given
to people
arrested at the same time they are requested to blow into the breathalizer.
(I did not
blow because I was afraid the police could manipulate that machine.) And,
people should
be on videotape showing the police give them the phone and the option to
call a lab, and
the phone numbers to the lab. This was all his idea. I was thrilled. Because
if that had happened
to me, then, I would have made the call then (instead of 14 hours when I got
out of jail),
AND I would have blown -- because then I would feel I had a chance, no
matter what the
results of the breathalizer, since I knew nothing was in my blood or urine.

He then told me he would get in touch with the jail, and find out why they
are not doing this now,
and talk to Rep Burt Saunders, so that a new law can be made to require the
jails to do this.

And, I told him: my DUI instructor told me she sees more and more people
like me in her classes
now. People who claim, as I did then and now, that no drugs or alcohol was
in their system, but
they were arrested for the first time, afraid, lost, frightened, etc., (all
these things that look like
symptons of drug use to a police officer).

So, maybe next year you will have this bill on your desk to sign, which
would help people like
me, who are not guilty of a criminal offense but get mistakenly entangled in
this system,. and will help
people who are especially concerned about proving their innocence because
they may have
a past history of drug use but are now clean.

And, it will help police, because this will givethem a more favorable image
to the public, as they will be helping people preserve their  due process
rights, and this will help them weed out those cases which should not be in
this criminal system in the first place. I could tell he saw a lot of
benefits in this for the police. And, I explained to him I am not anti-cop,
as I have worked with good cops in the schools.

He also mentioned to me that beginning this July, in FL, refusing to blow is
now a criminal offense --
all the more reason to ensure people who are too frightened to blow, like I
was, but are not guilty of a crime,
are given a chance to get an independent blood or urine test at the time of
arrest,
as police are not required to give those tests.

All in all, a great day. No help to any lawyers, I might add. LOL... :)

Mr. McLester, your email was forwarded to me from Dr. Medows/Gov. Bush in
regards to your question concerning branded generics counting against the 4
brand limit.
As you may know, we take our data feed from First Data Bank which classifies
the drugs  as generics, single source brands, or multi source brands.
Typically it is very straight forward such as furosemide being classified as
generic and Lasix as a multisource brand. On occasion a generic will be
classified as a brand because of their inflated AWP making it more expensive
than what a generic should be in comparison to the multisource brand. 
We are currently putting together a list of drugs that fall into that
situation and will do 2 things with them: 1. Apply a state MAC to the price
thus lowering to an acceptable and comparable price within that therapeutic
category 2. Reclassify as a generic and therefore not count against the 4
brand limit.
Please feel free to call me at 850-922-7702 if you need further
clarification.

This obviously was well planned.  The person who kidnapped Kilya knew her
well, where she lived and that she was under the care of the child
welfare system to be able to fabricate the story to make it sound
ligitimate..  This child did not just "fall through the cracks".

 Jeb,
Hopefully this will give you some info regarding this Bill.  FL Dept of
Children & Family Services is intrusive enough and doesn't need more "nanny
state" powers.  When is the state going to stop trying to run the lives of
FL citizens.  We have enough laws and don't need "fishing expedition" laws
to further intrude on citizens.  What happened to the "small government"
Republicans? And why do these "legislators" have to SNEAK this Bill through
on a completely unrelated Bill...this smells.  Why don't you veto it and
REQUIRE the legislators to pass it on it's own merit.
Dan

Background:


S.B. 1844 is an economic development bill that has nothing to do with early
education. Yet Senate Majority leader John McKay slipped his Government
Nanny bill (formerly S.B. 88) into S.B. 1844.


Therefore, S.B. 1844 is now the vehicle to create a new government program
called Learning Gateway and will involve "developing strategies for offering
hospital visits or home visits by trained staff to new mothers."


The purpose of Learning Gateway is to screen children from birth to age 9
for "biological, environmental, and behavioral risks," and "learning
problems." Furthermore, Learning Gateway providers will conduct "intake with
families," conduct "needs/strength based assessments of families," and "make
referrals for needed services" and "developmental monitoring."


This will all be done in collaboration with the Florida Department of
Children and Family Services and numerous other big government agencies and
programs.


Some additional reasons to opposes S.B. 1844:



S.B. 1844 mandates automatic referrals of high risk newborns to the local
Learning Gateway through the Office of Vital Statistics. Who determines what
is considered high risk? There is no parental consent required for this
referral. What happens if the parent chooses not to follow up on this
referral?


S.B. 1844 directs that screening processes be developed and tested to
address social/emotional/behavioral indicators which could be a sign of
future problems. Will the Florida Department of Children and Families take
the child away if the parent chooses to follow his own doctor's advice
instead of the government's?


S.B. 1844 requires that an electronic data system be developed to track
children who are screened, assessed, and referred for services. Will mom and
dad be able to remove the child from the government programs if the initial
screening is done without parent's consent?


S.B. 1844 creates a huge, expensive bureaucracy, with the intent of
expanding the program statewide. The pilot project is $6 million the first
year for only three counties what will it cost taxpayers to fund this
program for the whole state?

Subject: RE: literacy/reading events


Governor,
I went straight to the expert on this one -- here are Joe T's thoughts on
Reading Rescue:

ML,

I am supportive of Reading Rescue.  They took some good ideas from Reading 
Recovery and developed them further by adding a more explicit component to 
their tutoring.  I have actually spoken at one of their training 
meetings.  We are also hiring Dr. Marcia Grek, who has been working as 
their head of professional development, to be one of our staff at 
FCRR.  (Marcia worked for us before she spent the last year working for 
Reading Rescue).

I think this model has a lot of potential-and will certainly continue to be 
a prominent player in the mix of solutions that schools develop for 
providing immediate intensive interventions to their children.  My concern 
at present is whether the model (it uses regular classroom teachers to 
provide the interventions, and involves using aides as substitutes while 
the teachers are out of the classroom) has the delivery capacity for 
schools that have a very high proportion of at risk children.  However, the 
basic instructional approach is much better than Reading Recovery, which 
continues to advocate a less explicit form of instruction, and the 
professional development they provide is very good.  It is clearly one of 
the models for early intervention that deserves our support.  They do have 
available some relatively impressive empirical data showing effectiveness, 
however, I have not had a chance to examine this data in close detail.

Cheers,

Joe T.

TO: Governor Jeb Bush, Lisa McFadden, Mark Nelson

	On May 29, Chancellor Levy of the New York City Schools, Jack
Rosenthal, President of the New York Times Foundation, Manhattan
Councilwoman Eva Moskowitz, businessman/philanthropist and UF grad,
Benedict Silverman, will attend a celebration in Manhattan
congratulating the educators who have achieved success with Reading
Rescue, Florida's economical, effective literacy intervention, in
District 6 schools (Washington Heights, an Hispanic community).

	Governor Bush can celebrate the success of Reading Rescue with
Florida
educators on June 17, 18, 19, 20, or 21, when The Literacy Trust (a
charitable, nonprofit foundation) will be holding the first of its
Reading Rescue Summer Institutes on campus at UF in the Academic
Research Building. The second Institute the week of July 15th will be at
the Hampton Inn on the beach at St. Augustine.  Reading teachers and
coordinators from several Florida counties and from six other states
will participate as distinguished researchers share their latest
findings. 
We would love to welcome the Governor to one or both of these Institutes
where he could hear first-hand reports from the
educators who are seeing success with Reading Rescue. Others who may
wish to attend are invited to contact us.

	While Florida has looked to other states for ways to improve
reading
instruction and test scores, other states have been turning to us for
help. The Governor should know how powerful our model, developed in
cooperation with the University of Florida with support from the Florida
DOE, is when fully implemented in raising achievement among at-risk
students, and how cost-effective for schools to implement. This is
a model taxpayers can love and - in the words of one superintendent
whose district has 53% bilingual students (see the attached letter) -
ours is a model for which schools have been waiting.

	Reading Rescue is not a program schools purchase; it's not a set
of
books, it's not computer software. Rather, the adoption of Reading
Rescue reflects an elementary school's decision to use their existing
resources differently in order to improve instruction in classrooms and
to provide high-quality, one-on-one instruction for those students who
will not learn to read successfully without it. Our organization
provides the technical assistance and delivers the training to prepare
members of a school's staff to tutor during the regular school day while
improving instruction for all in classrooms.  Thus, the number of high
quality instructional hours for students who need them most
increases without a commensurate increase in costs. And, not just the
students who are tutored benefit with this model - instruction is
enhanced in the classrooms of all participating teachers. Test scores
rise overall - not just among those who are tutored.
  
	Volunteers and after-hours programs are needed but they're not a
permanent solution to the problem of reading failure in the early
grades. Schools that adopt Reading Rescue are committed to a permanent,
feasible solution during the school day and using their regular staff.
In visiting a Reading Rescue Institute, the Governor will be showing his
support for Florida schools that are accepting responsibility for their
most basic mission of teaching each student to read.

	The Elementary Supervisor and Title 1 Coordinator in Walton
County,
Marsh Pugh, has already invited the Governor to visit their schools and
Marsha can verify that, in 2001-2002, no child whose performance was in
the the bottom quartile at the beginning of the year, and who received
Reading Rescue tutoring during the year, scored in the bottom quartile
on the standardized test administered at the end of the year. Most were
brought up into the average and above average ranges.  Walton County
achieved those results by using their existing staff who tutored over
100 children during the regular school day. Test scores have risen
dramatically for all students as a result of Reading Rescue.  

	Reading Rescue represents a successful business/education
partnership
since the program's development and evaluation was supported through
gifts from a businessman to the UF College of Education.  The same
individual, Benedict Silverman, now supports national expansion of
the model. 

	 The Governor can learn about Reading	 Rescue by visiting one
of our
Summer Institutes and we would be honored to welcome him.

Dear Governor Jeb:

You are probably receiving many suggestions regarding improving the welfare
of children in Florida, but I would like to offer several.

Prevention:

1.   Mandatory child development and parenting education for all high school
students.  Many children are currently being raised in homes with absentee
or "busy" parents and do not have a good parenting role model.  With smaller
families, many children grow up without exposure to younger siblings.
Therefore they are unaware of the difficulties of parenting small children.

2.   Expansion of the Healthy Families program.  The Healthy Start and
Healthy Families programs could be merged and controlled more directly by
local communities, as the Healthy Start programs are currently managed.

Intervention:

1.   A modified mandatory Healthy Families program would put family support
workers in the home three to four times a week and may permit more children
to remain in their homes or to be returned home sooner.

2.   Children, whose parents will probably have their parental rights
terminated, should be placed on a dual track from birth, both for foster
care and adoption.  Then, after one year, when parental rights were
terminated the adoption could rapidly progress.

Thanks for your consideration.

Keep up the good work.

Doctor Jeane

A follow up to my other email regarding the billboard with your face and 
mentee.
Just wanted you to know that Linda is helping me greatly in spite of the
pressure she is getting on the other end.
Her Bank is also a major sponsor of Viva Broward again..and next year they
have secured me to bring Viva Florida around the state...
It's very big this year....and with their support it helps me accomplish
our goals of creating tourism to Broward with a full calendar of top level
events around Hispanic Heritage Month.
Will send the calendar to Arlene for possible attendance at one or more of
our events this fall.

Let me know about the billboard as soon as you can....so I can help Linda get 
this done.

Subject: Hyperbaric O2 Treatment



Governor Bush,

We met at the Family Cafe.  I was the Physical Therapist who was
vehemently opposed to Medicaid covering Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment for
Children and Adults with Neurological Disorders such as Cerebral Palsy
etc.  I apologize for the intensity of my emotion; however, I am an
advocate for the disabled community and will not tolerate the waist of
precious government funds.

After our conversation, I spoke with Lynn Metz at the State Medicaid
Office.  She states that she has been researching the subject since
yesterday per your instructions.  I asked whether she had found any
information which indicated Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment was effective in
the treatment of Neurological Disorders.  She said "No" all the date
indicated Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment was ineffective in treating
Neurological Disorders.  Just as I had said at the conference.  It is
notable that Hyerbaric Oxygen Treatment has been effective in wound care
however when treating anaerobic wounds.

I appreciate your quick attention to this matter.  Quite frankly I am
impressed with your diligence and honesty.  Mostly when a government
official tells you "I'll look into it" it is an empty promise.

I believe the State of Florida will save millions of dollars by
eliminating funding for Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment for Neurological
Disorders, all of which can be directed towards aides which are
effective.  Additionally, individuals who advocate these treatment
regimens for children and adults with Cerebral Palsy are charlatans,
similar to those who advocate Chelation therapy etc.  They promise hope
to these families and deliver nothing.

Thanks again for your quick attention,
You are great,

Benjamin Gilbert MSPT

Dear Governor Bush:

I hope this finds you doing well.

Last Friday, my fiancé Donna attended the Palm Beach County Job Fair to
seek
employment in order to work closer to our home.  As you know, we
presently
live in Palm
Beach County and Donna's present commute is about 45 minutes each way to
and
from Sunrise, Florida.

There is a elementary school in Delray Beach about 7 miles from our
house,
called Pine Grove.  Pine Grove's student body consist of students of low
income families, with low test scores.

Donna teaches fourth grade and has had enormous success working with low
income students who are below grade level.  Based on the makeup of
Donna's
classroom, she continually achieves high FCAT test scores even higher
than
schools in better areas like Boca Raton and other upscale communities.
(see
test scores below). Donna achieves these high scores even though 95% of
her
classroom receives free or reduced lunches.  Like I told you before, if
all
things are equal, I will put Donna up against not only any fourth grade
teacher in Florida but any fourth grade teacher in the US.

Pine Grove is very interested in hiring Donna and would like to have her
as
one of their teachers.   Unfortunately, if she moves from Broward County
to
Palm Beach County, Palm Beach County will only accept 10 years and
instead
of 12 and
they want to put her on a three year probation/annual contract.

I believe it is in your best interest and the State of Florida to make
exceptions in order to assist great teachers like Donna, to stay in the
profession as long as possible.  Also, it is not fair for teachers of
Donna's ability that have dedicated so many good years to the state
education program to be put on probation or lose two years just because
they
are moving from one county to another.

I would greatly appreciated it if you would have someone contact me this
week to discuss this matter in more detail.  I can be reached on my cell
phone at 310.867.4365. Though my cell # is a LA number, I am located in
Boca
Raton, Florida.

Thank you for your time and consideration to this matter.

Best regards,

Vic Rose

Dear Governor Bush:

I hope this finds you and your family do well.

Not so long ago, I heard that you were going to allow teachers from one
county to transfer to other counties in Florida, without losing any
tenure.   Has this been put into effect?

As you know, my fiancé Donna, teaches fourth grade in Broward County and
she would like to relocate closer to our home but Donna does not want to
lose of any of years.  Can you let me know the status of this issue?
Right now, Palm Beach will allow you to transfer 10 but Donna has been
teaching for 12 years.

Palm Beach County has their job fair this Friday and I would like to
receive a response to this specific question by Thursday.

Dear Governor Bush: 
 
As a member of the Florida High Tech Corridor Council, I have been a volunteer working with a program which I believe is a revolutionary on-line training course to actually use technology to allow K-12 educators to learn how to use technology efficiency and integrate it in to their curriculum.    It is called "Teachers Discovering Computers" and I have now seen it's results for the past two years, reviewed the research on it's results with both teachers and administrators, and believe it is a perfect candidate for 
federal Title 1 Professional Development Funds.    When you see what it does for teachers, and the subsequent environment for learning for today's world that it creates for students,  you will become a huge fan.     This is obviously not just about teacher training, it is about teaching the workforce of tomorrow - it is about economic development and therefore the Florida High Tech Corridor Council has a keen interest in finding appropriate ways to assist.
 
The exciting part is that I have now connected with the President of Georgia G.L.O.B.E. (Global Learning Online for Business & Education), Dr. Richard Skinner, and we believe that together, the states of Georgia and Florida could be most effective in sharing our initiative and proposal for funding and implementation. 
 
It is my understanding that you will be with Governor Barnes in Atlanta from June 22 - 24th in conjunction with the 16 Governors who make up the SREB.     Dr. Skinner has spoken with Ron Newcombe, GA Governor Barnes' education advisor, about the possibility of your discussing Georgia "Get Fit" program and "Teachers Discovering Computers" in depth during your visit.     Get Fit = Giving Educators Training for Integrating Technology. 
 
In Orange County,  hundreds of teachers (K-12 and Workforce Development Teachers and Administrators) have now taken this course and it's success is well documented.    The last pilot training program of over l00 teachers was jointly funded by the Florida High Tech Corridor Council, 
Orange County Public Schools, and the Teacher Education Institute.    
 
To learn more about Georgia's program, please visit the site: 
www.getfitgeorgia.com 
 
In the near future, I will send you more information, but I would greatly appreciate your guidance on how this program may receive the best "audience" for Florida.      I ask you to please inquire of Governor Barnes when you are in Atlanta in June.     I look forward to answering any questions you may have.
 
Thank you.

Dear Gov Bush, 

I just wanted to let you know I mailed you some information last week about the CCCAC.  I have sent my application in for this Committee which recommends to the Mint & Congress subjects and designs for our commemorative coinage.  Any support from you would be greatly appreciated.

Please see resolution below.  After speaking with the provider, it seems
this was a Medicare issue.

Charles, I finally talked to Gaston Riera who referred me back to Irma who
indicated that they were needing a Medicare provider number.  Irma said she
has been in contact with Medicare and Medicare is handling the problem.  She
thanked me for my services and they have the situation in hand.

Pat Kelly tried to contact the individual that emailed us again on Monday
with no success.  We have to talk with them to process any further.
According to staff at the provider's office, they are trying to get a
Medicare, not Medicaid number.  We are attempting to verify this, as we
think they are really in need of a crossover identification matching their
Medicare/Medicaid info.  Pat doesn't think that the office understands the
nature of this problem.  She is going to verify the nature of the request as
soon as Riera returns.

Govenor Jeb Bush:

Thank you for the help you have provided to me in the past.  I write to
you 
today requesting your aid once again.  Steve M. Weisbond, O.D., our 
optometrist is having trouble in receiving his Medicare/Medicaid
provider 
number.  He contacted his Medicare/Medicaid biller in Jacksonville
yesterday 
who claims that Dr. Weisbond has been issued a provider number since
August 
of 2001.  The biller also states that a letter was sent to our office on

April 5, 2002 with the new number listed.  We have received no such
letter.  
Without this provider number, Dr. Weisbond has been unable the receive 
payment of over one year of Medicare/Medicaid claims.  

Dr. Weisbond is essential to our business.  If you could please help us 
resolve this matter it will be greatly appreciated.  The tracking number

provided is 71203606118 and Florida Optometry License #1704.  Any help
that 
you could possibly provide would be great.  Thank you for your time.

Hello Jeb,
I would recommend Patrick Martin, an engineer with the Lake Worth
Drainage
District.  I have known Patrick for many years and think very highly of
him.
Plus, his educational background is in coastal engineering, so he is
very
knowledgeable about the issues we face at the navigation district. I
believe
Andy Edwards from Palm Beach County would also recommend Patrick.  Andy,
as
you know, is very active in the Republic Party of Palm Beach, but he
also
chairs the Lake Worth Drainage District board, and thus, knows Patrick
well.
Thanks for the opportunity to make a recommendation, Governor!

Hello Governor,
Well you and your brother certainly wowed us in Miami yesterday!
Congratulations on a wonderful event, and also thanks and
congratulations to
you and your staff for all the hard work in bringing us through the very
difficult legislative process this year.  All in all, I think everyone
can
return home proud of the work that was accomplished under  trying
circumstances, but you deserve much of the kudos for bringing players to
the
table and reaching consensus.  Now, on to the 2002 election!

Also, as the newly elected chairman of the Florida Inland Navigation
District Commission, I wanted to bring to your attention an issue
dealing
with a pending appointment to this agency.  One of your 1999 appointees
to
the commission, Ji-Ang Song, an engineer from West Palm Beach, has
recently
had to resign his post due to a conflict with a new job.  That leaves
the
Palm Beach County seat vacant as we enter a crucial time of the year
when we
develop and adopt our FY2002-03 budget.  Although our annual budget is
rather small by comparison to other agencies ($40 million, and we have
managed to hold it to roll back rates for the past several years), it
nonetheless does involve a number of local cost share projects in each
of
our eleven counties.  As such, I suspect that Palm Beach County would
benefit from having a newly appointed commissioner looking after their
interests in this process.  I understand that you have several highly
qualified applicants pending at this time, and with all due respect,
would
like to call your attention to their interest in the commission
appointment.
Thank you!  I look forward to seeing you soon,
Cathy

May  22, 2002
Honorable Jeb Bush
Governor

Dear  Governor,

I would like to recommend the  appointment of John Verdon to fulfill the remainder of Nora Williams'
term as Monroe County Commissioner. I have known Mr. Verdon for some time and have found him to be  of outstanding character and ability. He will  represent the citizens of our district and our county in an exemplary manner.

In my capacity as Councilman and Mayor of Islamorada,  I had numerous  contacts with Mr. Verdon.  I came to admire his efforts and dedication in working as an advocate for water quality in the Keys.  Since that time,  he has shown experience and leadership in other areas of  public service.

The last time I met with you was about a year ago. It was my privilege to present  you and the Cabinet with Islamorada's Comprehensive Plan.  Nora Williams and I traveled together;  that was the day you gave her the "big hug". 

All the best.
Frank R. Kulisky

I would like to recommend  Gul Cumber for the Board of Commissioners of the North Broward Hospital District. The bord composition now has minority representation with African Americans and Hispanic, however, I feel that a woman, particularly of another ethnic culture would be helpful and much appreciated. There is enough good old boy network here already.

Governor Bush,

We met at the Family Cafe.  I was the Physical Therapist who was
vehemently opposed to Medicaid covering Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment for
Children and Adults with Neurological Disorders such as Cerebral Palsy
etc.  I apologize for the intensity of my emotion; however, I am an
advocate for the disabled community and will not tolerate the waist of
precious government funds.

After our conversation, I spoke with Lynn Metz at the State Medicaid
Office.  She states that she has been researching the subject since
yesterday per your instructions.  I asked whether she had found any
information which indicated Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment was effective in
the treatment of Neurological Disorders.  She said "No" all the date
indicated Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment was ineffective in treating
Neurological Disorders.  Just as I had said at the conference.  It is
notable that Hyerbaric Oxygen Treatment has been effective in wound care
however when treating anaerobic wounds.

I appreciate your quick attention to this matter.  Quite frankly I am
impressed with your diligence and honesty.  Mostly when a government
official tells you "I'll look into it" it is an empty promise.

I believe the State of Florida will save millions of dollars by
eliminating funding for Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment for Neurological
Disorders, all of which can be directed towards aides which are
effective.  Additionally, individuals who advocate these treatment
regimens for children and adults with Cerebral Palsy are charlatans,
similar to those who advocate Chelation therapy etc.  They promise hope
to these families and deliver nothing.

Thanks again for your quick attention,
You are great,

Benjamin Gilbert MSPT

Dear Chris,

Governor Bush forwarded your e-mail to me at your request.  Thank you so
much for taking the time to write such thoughtful and compelling words.
Chris, you are one of the true heroes.  You have experienced first hand the
good and the bad of our foster care system.  Kids like you are why Governor
Bush always challenges us to do better every day. We have been working very
hard to bring about the systemic change that you refer to in your letter.
But, no matter how hard we work, the "system" will always depend on people
like Katherine Smith who dedicate their lives to protect children.  I am
glad that your relationship with your caseworker is such a positive one.

I would be interested in knowing your thoughts about what could be done to
discourage foster teens from running away.  This is a challenge for all
child welfare programs and your perspective would be very valuable to us.

I really appreciate the time you took to write.  Thanks for keeping all of
us that work in child welfare in your thoughts and prayers.

Judge K

                  21 May 2002



The Honorable Kathleen Kearney, Secretary
Florida Department of Children & Families
1317 Winewood Blvd., Building 1, Room 202
Tallahassee, Florida 32399-0700


Dear Secretary Kearney:


The Department of Children & Families is committed to working in
partnership with local communities to ensure safety, well-being and
self-sufficiency for the people we serve.  ----Florida Department of
Children & Families, Mission Statement.

In recent weeks, it has been found that the Florida Department of
Children & Families has not fully met its requirements to ensure that
all children under its care are safe, and free from harm. In the case of
Rilya Wilson questions, reasonably raised, about the state's performance
in protecting children in the child welfare system are very troubling.
It is essential that these issues are resolved quickly and that our
child welfare system is equipped with the tools necessary to guard
against failures similar to this in the future.

In the few weeks after the Rilya tragedy, our Governor Jeb Bush and the
Florida Legislature passed and signed into law, House Bill 71-E,
tailored specifically to prevent caseworkers that will not live up to
the high standards established by law, from falsifying records and
getting away with it.

This law sets penalties for those who would try to circumvent the law by
falsifying official state records of persons under the care and custody
of the state of Florida. In addition, it provides for 15 years in prison
for any record falsified that would eventually cause bodily harm or
death to any child under the state's care and supervision.

I commend the leadership of our Governor nd the Legislature, and
yourself madam Secretary in confronting this problem head on, and trying
to use all available resources to adequately deal with it.

A few days after the tragedy, the Governor formed a Blue Ribbon Panel
commissioned to provide an interim and definitive set of recommendations
for DCF to better fulfill its mission, and goals.

I sincerely hope, that these recommendations will encourage DCF to look
at what needs to be done, what has been done, and what will meet the
needs and safety of every child under its care for the 21st century.

Its so very important that DCF make systemic changes, because so many
children and families depend upon your agency, madam Secretary for their
very livelihood.

In this context, we need to look beyond the actions of a few caseworkers
that do not meet the high standards, and high demands our law and the
Department places on them; and look to the hardworking, committed
caseworkers across our state, working tirelessly, day in and day out to
help our most vulnerable---our children chart the path to live out their
dreams.

As a foster kid, here in Leon County, who happens to have benefited from
one such person, Katherine Smith, I see the need, and the eventually
inevitable urgency for affirmative action.  In the end, the long run,
this finally tears down a wall, built steadily over the years, that has
blocked the voice, and potential of so many kids throughout our state.


God bless.


Sincerely,


                                                                    Chris

I work with High School Students with disabilities and help them make the
transition from High School to work or to post-secondary education or
training.  This is challenging for many reasons.  Decreasing accessibility
into buildings in our community will only add to the issues that prevent
these very capable students from being successful workers.

On behalf of the disabled community, we want assurance that our Florida
Statutes listing our more stringent accessibility laws not be changed,
altered, amended, deleted, or defaulted to the Federal Code in any way.  We

Subject: Messersmith: Email Version of Letter Mailed Today

Dear Gov. Bush and Lt. Gov. Brogan:

Last week a special committee of the Florida Sheriffs Association (FSA) 
gathered in Tallahassee to discuss the continuing and growing crisis 
involving law enforcement and the Florida Baker Act.
The meeting was called as a result of the unsuccessful effort to pass 
substantive legislation last session to amend the Baker Act to remove law 
enforcement from the “front lines” of dealing with and housing the mentally 
ill.

The Florida Sheriffs Association proposes reforming the Baker Act to permit 
intervention for those with severe mental illnesses who need treatment before 
they deteriorate to dangerousness and to allow court-ordered treatment in the 
community. These changes are necessary to reverse the current Baker Act trend 
of law enforcement agents increasingly acting as the front line contact for 
people with severe mental illnesses in crises.  Across the state law 
enforcement initiates 100 Baker Act petitions per day, nearly as many as 
those initiated by mental health professionals.  In nearly a third of our 
counties, law enforcement initiates nearly all of the petitions and mental 
health professionals initiate none.

The current Baker Act creates a public safety and quality of life problem for 
all Floridians.  People with severe mental illnesses are placed at risk 
because the law requires dangerousness before medical intervention can occur. 
 When someone finally reaches the point of dangerousness, other people and 
law enforcement are placed at substantial risk. Altercations between law 
enforcement and people with severe mental illnesses too often result in 
injury or death.  Additionally, the failure to receive prompt treatment 
results in an increasing number of these individuals to be placed in our 
correctional facilities. 

Reforming the Baker Act will allow for those with “revolving door” histories 
to be treated before they become dangerous.  The new criteria is designed 
specifically to ensure earlier intervention for recidivists.  The proposal 
also allows judges to order community based treatment rather than just 
hospitalization.  The reforms, the Sheriffs believe, should not require a new 
infusion of funding: the criteria is limited to recidivists and does not 
establish a new class to be treated; the community based treatment provisions 
are an option rather than a mandate; and, effective treatment will result in 
offsetting costs due to decreased hospitalizations, violence, and arrests.



However, in our effort to reform the Baker Act, we were opposed by numerous 
groups involved in the Florida judicial process (Public Defenders, Judges, 
Court Administrators, and so forth) due to their concern about lack of 
funding presently and fear that amendments will result in more costly 
processes and caseload changes.

Therefore, the Sheriffs are beginning a summer of meetings with 
“stakeholders” to attempt to resolve conflicts prior to next session when 
legislation will be filed again.  In that regard, and since this will require 
input, direction and budget considerations, the Sheriffs would like to meet 
with you and your staff to discuss this crisis, inform you about the proposal 
and fiscal issues posed, and seek your support and assistance for this 
crucial endeavor.

Sincerely, 

Frank S. Messersmith

I'm sure with all the things that you have to deal with on a daily basis, you 
won't remember me.  My granddaughter was the little girl from U B Kinsey 
Elementary School of the Arts that you met in West Palm Beach when you came 
for Front Porch Florida two years ago.  I tried to get a photo of the two of 
you together, but your photographer didn't take one and neither did the 
Mayor's office.  You were kind enough to send an autographed photo of 
yourself for her and she was thrilled to get it.

I realize that this was a little thing, but it meant a lot to her.  It also 
made me realize the kind of person you were to take the time to do something 
that sweet for a first grader.  It was important to you, and she was 
important to you.  If a little six year old girl meant that much to you, I 
realized that you are genuinely concerned for the whole people of Florida.  
Your care and concern is so obvious, and that is the kind of person I want to 
be my governor.  Even though I am a registered democrat, you have my vote.  

I wish you blessings as you begin your campaign all the way to victory.

Take care,

Subject: RE: PSC 



Governor,

This is in follow up to the email below from residents in the Boca Raton
area that are trying to get a FPL transmission line moved from their
neighborhood.  The concerns of the residents relate to whether the line in
question is in compliance with safety standards and other concerns, such as
diminished property value, loss of quiet enjoyment of their property, and
improper notice of other agency permitting proceedings.  Yesterday, after 4
1/2 hours of testimony from the residents, the Commission decided that we
did not have jurisdiction to address the concerns of the residents other
than whether the line meets national safety codes.  

On the issue of safety of transmission lines, the Commission has been given
statutory authority to enforce the National Electric Safety Code.  On
Tuesday, the Commission voted that the transmission line is in compliance
with this safety code.   Our decision on safety compliance will be issued as
proposed agency action since the matter has not been to hearing.  This means
the residents can protest our order and request an evidentiary hearing.  

With regard to jurisdiction, the Commission voted that the PSC lacks
statutory authority over the siting of this transmission line.  The PSC has
siting authority over transmission lines greater than 15 miles in length
under the Transmission Line Siting Act.  However, lines under that threshold
do not require certification under this act.  The transmission line in
question in this case is 4.5 miles in length.  Therefore, we lack any siting
authority.  Further, we decided that the PSC is not the proper forum to
address the other concerns of the residents relating to diminished property
value, lack of any notice to the residents of the line's construction, or
any of the aesthetic concerns raised by the residents.  Our General Counsel
advised that the circuit court system is the appropriate venue for this
debate.  

Let me know if you want more detail on this case.  Thank you.  Lila

Subject: PSC 

Dear Governor:  I am one of three people from my community that have
filed a case with the PSC: Teresa Badillo FPSC Log: 344754E, Jose Gutman
FPSC Log: 366172E and Jeffrey Leserra FPSC log:  367987E.  The PSC flew
down and had a meeting on June 15,2001 with some of the representatives
from our community concerning the 100 Ft. Transmission Lines that were
placed on the right of way of the SFWMD in the back of our homes without
notification.  At that meeting we presented our issues and we were told
a "Resolution" would be given within a couple of weeks.  Well, months
and months passed and we never received the final resolution until I had
contacted your office a month ago and that precipated the PSC to finally
keep their word.  However, the individuals from the PSC's meeting last
June who were working with us trying to find an alternate route for FPL
(that was the main discussion of the meeting in June) no longer are
employed by the PSC for various reasons.  The new individual overseeing
everything is Mr. McLean at 850 413-7286.  Mr. McLean has shown no
interest whatsoever in helping us or at least continue what had been
initiated by the other individuals at the PSC who are now gone.
Consequently, the resolution sent to us indicated on very strong ground
that the case be dismissed.  None of the original issues at the meeting
in June had been taken into consideration nor have any of the
individuals involved with this resolution had first hand involvement
with us.  Now we are faced with a hearing with the Commissioners on May
21st and the odds are heavily weighted against us.  We have no
explanation why the PSC waited months to write a resolution and then
give us one with no regard to our original meeting that took place to
establish the issues in the first place.  I have tried to determine how
much impact this resolution will have on the Commissioners at the
hearing (which means we travel from Boca Raton to Tallahassee) by
speaking to Dr. Cochran Keating who has not been able to give me any
information in that regard.  I feel that resolution should be null and
void for two reasons - it should have been sent to us immediately after
the original meeting with the individuals involved with the case.  Plus
the Agenda for the Commission Conference is based on resolution which
has dismissed our case.  We are limited to 3 issues they feel relevant
which have nothing to do with our original meeting or complaint.  If
something could please be done so that justice could prevail here!  We
are walking into a den of lions with no recourse.  The writing is on the
wall and our hands are tied.  Please help!!  One of the issues I brought
up at this meeting in June was concerning a zoning violation.  FPL had
been running electricity through these transmission lines for over three
months without a CO.  The PSC wants to have safety issues - well,
nothing was said but a letter sent to me stating that FPL recitified the
situation after the fact.  I was expecting to get an injunction for a
zoning violation because the PSC lawyer Ms. Isaac had said that would be
the case if we found a  zoning violation.  I have all the information
and the paperwork to prove this happened.  I can be reached at 561
482-2855 or Badillo9@aol.com.  Please let us know what we need to do.
Thank you so very much for any input you may have.  Teresa Badillo

They expect the Nelson amendment to fail.  Given floor procedures, Nelson must now offer his amendment in two pieces to avoid points of order…this makes it even harder for Nelson to win.

Joette ... from the attached letter that I just received, it appears that the 8.5 SMA residents were not permitted to give public comment at the IOP public meeting last night on anything to do with the 8.5 SMA, to include on the Corps modeling which indicates increase flooding in their area due to the degradation of the southern 4 miles of the L-67 extension levee.  Not sure I understand why ... since you were there maybe you can explain?
 
This L-67 removal issue strikes at the heart of our objections with how the IOP is being implemented, i.e. making structural changes now before the modeling is finalized or the IOP EIS ROD has been signed ... both modeling and ROD are not expected to be finalized until June but implementation has already begun.  In the case of the L-67 levee degradation, which has always been scheduled to be the last component of Mod Waters completed because of such flood protection issues, it is already being completed, modeling indicates it will in fact exacerbate flooding, and it can't be reversed ... if in fact the final modeling demonstrates increased flooding, residents in Miami-Dade County will experience increased flooding until Mod Waters is complete ... "the bell can't be un-rung" unless the L-67 extension is reconstructed or the 8.5 protection levee is built quickly ... what was already a bad situation for flooding in M-D county has just gotten worse ... and this without a completed EIS which is our safeguard to preventing such.
 
And by the way, the Corps current modeling results have been removed from public access on the Jax Corps web site ... did they explain this at the meeting last night?  Do agencies get to see them?  Tribes are to be treated by the federal agencies in a "government-to-government" relationship ... was this addressed as a reason to give the Miccosukee Tribe access if other government entities have access?
 
Did someone bring up the Miami-Dade County Flood Management Task Force resolution of last week that IOP should never be implemented until it is clear that there is solid evidence that flooding in Miami-Dade county will not be exacerbated? And this was after a Corps presentation that said the current modeling did show increased flooding.
 
Please give me your insights!

Dear Gov. Bush:
 
On Monday, May 6, 2002, you established a Blue Ribbon Panel on Child Protection to review the performance of the states child protection system in Miami Dade County.  The panel is comprised of community leaders who I am sure bring a wealth of experience and wisdom to the task before them as you stated in your press release before appointing them.  Any panel created to investigate any inappropriate actions in the Department of Children and Family (DCF) should be ethnically and racially diverse, especially in Miami-Dade County.  The panel should reflect the citizens of Miami-Dade County, since 85% of the children in the custody of the DCF are African American.  Members of the African American community called this fact to the attention of your office.   Their requests and cries for inclusion went unheeded. Therefore, today as an elected member of the Florida Legislature, I am asking you on behalf of my community that you diversify the Blue Ribbon Panel on Child Protection.  It is my belief that without the proper racial and cultural diversity, the Blue Ribbon Panel will be unable to make meaningful recommendations that will holistically address the needs of the population of children within the DCF. Consequently, the Black community will meet any recommendations with skepticism and suspicion. 
 
I am recommending to you three (3) African American Health Care Professionals and Child Advocates to serve on the Blue Ribbon Panel.  They are Dr. Marietta Mischia, former M-DCPS Principal and member of the Community Relations Board; Ms. Tangela Sears, former employee of the DCF; and Ms. Irene Brown Humes, Foster and Adoption Parent.  I have contact information for all of them and they are willing to serve on the panel.
 
It is of the utmost importance that before the panel completes their final report, there is input reflected from all segments of the community.  The problem in foster care is systemic and we must be diligent about changing the system from top to bottom. It is my understanding that the present panel members, excluding Sarah Herald, were recommended to you by Judge Kathleen Kearney.  Also, Judge Kearney told you the questions that the panel should ask and what they should do.  She also suggested that Dave Lawrence serve as Chair and laid out the specific questions for the panel.  It is insidious to think that Judge Kearney would recommend the panel to review the agency that she heads when she should be the target of the investigation.  In fact, I am appalled at the lack of public outcry for the resignation of Judge Kearney and Charles Auslander.  In fact, I am utterly disgusted over the fact that Mr. Auslander has not been arrested.  He is guilty of failure to report the disappearance of a minor and guilty of obstruction of justice.  He failed to immediately report Rilya’s disappearance and he obstructed justice when he deliberately withheld this information for six days.  If a biological parent had committed such an offense, the DCF would have moved swiftly to remove the child from the home and prosecute. In his position, Mr. Auslander is the surrogate parent of thousands of unwanted children.  They are trusted to his care and, as their state appointed guardian, he should be more responsible to them. If we want to change the system for the benefit of our children, we must change the system at its root. To that end, we must hold administrators accountable just as we would hold the general public accountable. 
 
I am also asking that you extend the deadline date, of the final report, in order for you to have the opportunity to diversify the membership of the panel.  I look forward to a response from you today.  I can be contacted at (305) 995-2451 or e-mailed at mdelancey@sbab.dade.k12.fl.us.

Someone from DBPR will call Mr. Tilton and tell him he can call himself
"Practical Engineer," but call himself nothing else.  See the following from
DBPR's Geoff Becker: 

"Sorry it has taken so long to get back to you on this.  Several years ago,
the licensing, regulation and enforcement of the engineering profession was
privatized.  The state now contracts with a private corporation to manage
this function.  The corporation is called the Florida Engineering Management
Corporation (http://www.fbpe.org/femc/).  Our acting-director of the Div. of
Professions (David Minacci), who is also the executive director of the
Florida Engineering Society, contacted them about Mr. Kononoff's e-mail and
Mr. Tilton's situation.  Here is his response...

'Unlike almost all other professions, the term "engineer" is not protected
under Chapter 471.  The only term that was protected was "professional
engineer".  This resulted in people holding themselves out as "civil
engineer", "structural engineer", or "chemical engineer" that were not
licensed which is very misleading to the public.  For example, there was
nothing in F.S. 471 that would prohibit someone from advertising as 'John
Doe, Structural Engineer.'  Florida Chapter 471 only prohibited someone from
holding themselves out as 'John Doe, Professional Engineer.'  During the
last legislative session, the Florida Engineer Society pushed for a bill (SB
990), and Legislature passed it, that protected those disciplines that are
actually tested to become a professional engineer resulting in not only the
term "professional engineer" being protected but many other disciplines
including those mentioned above.'

The point not included in his remarks here is that the term "practical" is
not covered in the new legislation.  Therefore, there is nothing precluding
Mr. Tilton from calling himself a "practical engineer."  We have checked
with FEMC and they have no record of anyone calling about such a
classification and would not advise them they needed some type of licensure.
However, should they want to practice themselves under the new provisions or
classifications, they would need to be properly licensed.  

Please let me know if you need anything else.  Again, sorry for the delay."

Sir, I'm writing you on behalf of my Father in Law, Edwin Tilton a
resident 
of Lake City Florida and a heavily decorated veteran of WWII.  He is
also an 
engineer and has a degree in nuclear physics having retired from FP & L
after 
serving in that capacity at Turkey Point Nuclear Power Plant. 

This man is nearing 80 years old and at this time in his life, the State

Florida is suddenly seeking to DENY him the right to put Practical
Engineer 
behind his name in retirement!  The state is also trying to force he and

others like him to take so-called ethics EXAMS and pay fees where none
of 
either existed previously!  

Sir, this is the backbone of your support in this state. The former
military 
retirees are a huge part of the voting public and to suddenly and
without 
warning call into question their integrity as well as put further strain
on 
retirement budgets is wrong.  Please have somebody from your office call
my 
Father in Law, DR. Ed Tilton at (386) 755-5263 in Lake City.  He can
explain 
the problem in greater detail or give me an address where he can "snail
mail" 
you and have it be assured of being read by somebody with some clout.
As I 
said he's nearing 80 and not of the "computer age."

ALSO,  I never heard from anybody in your legal dept about my previous 
question as to whether or not my personal info is available as a matter
of 
public record by my employer (Miami-Dade Schools) or in the DMV
database; 
since I'm a former law enforcement officer with the state of Florida
(State 
Correctional Probation and Parole Officer). You promised to have
somebody 
research the shield law and get back to me, but I never heard.
Thanks from myself and my "DAD"

Governor Jeb Bush,
 
  I wish to recommend Washington County Judge Allen Register to fill the position of Judge for the 14th Judicial Circuit. I have known Judge Register for near 20 years. During that time I have found him to be a very honest and trustworthy individual. His decisions are unbiased and impartial. I personally do not think you could find a better person to fill this position. He has Christian principles and is a dedicated husband and father. I do not think you could possibly find a better candidate and know you will never be disappointed if you make this appointment.

Dear Sir:
     My name is Michael S. Boland and I work as a Police Officer for the University of Florida Police Department.  I am writing you this letter in reference to our budget problem.  Our administration informed us that our operating budget has been cut in the amount of approximately 130,000.00 Dollars.  As a result we can only operate 4 patrol vehicles on shift because of the cost of gasoline and we do not have the funds to properly repair our vehicles.  This places officers at unneeded risk due to the extended response time for "back-up" to arrive and does not allow us the properly patrol the "sensitive" areas as needed.  I honesty do not know where the operating budget is spent or how it is divided and dispersed.  I know the state leaders would not cut the budget so severely that our department could not afford gasoline for our patrol vehicles. I realize that you alone do not have the resources to look into this problem but could you please tell me who could?  Any information you could provide would be helpful.

Thank You,
Michael Boland

Subject: Request From Noah's Ark for help re: the criminalization of disabilities



Jeb:

First, all of the parents and kids at Noah’s Ark appreciate your support. It has been essential. And thanks for your help and participation with the Family Café.

This email is to let you know of a practice of the State of Florida, a practice that I believe you would work to stop immediately if you knew about it.

I am working as a volunteer advocate for Steven, a 5th grader with significant development disabilities. He appears to be somewhere on the autism continuum. In the third grade Steven was arrested for hitting his teacher.  For the next year instructors from The Brown School came to his house twice a week, for an hour to two hours a session, in an effort to train him to be competent so he could be prosecuted for hitting his teacher. After a year they were unsuccessful.  Steven was not prosecuted. 

The Brown School is a company contracted by the State of Florida, and I am guessing at the direction of the state attorneys and/or judges, to train the developmentally disabled charged with crimes to become competent to stand trial. What I can’t understand is that a representative of the Browns School boasted that approximately 30 percent of the people they work with have IQ’s of 50 or below. They claim they are able to make 50% of those with IQ’s 50 or below competent to stand trial. To me, this is absurd. 

Back to Steven …Steven again has been charged with hitting his teacher. Steven needs services to help overcome his disabilities, not training so he can parrot answers that will put him in a juvenile detention center. If behavioral therapists had come to Steven’s house once a week and to his school once a week for a year, instead of receiving the Brown’s School instruction, there would have been a much better chance he, and his single mom, would not be facing the current charges. The State has money for competency training that hopes to permit the state to prosecute a developmentally delayed third grader, but the schools do not have the money for behavior therapists. 

In October Drew, my 16 year old son with Asperger’s Syndrome ( a high-functioning autistic), was arrested on complaints by teachers in his center school and taken to the Juvenile Detention Center. Often teachers are not properly trained and can't get the support services they feel they need.  The week before Drew’s teacher filed charges, she was scheduled to get long sought training.  That training that was canceled due to lack of funds.  The teachers and staff are frustrated and strike out though the criminal justice system.  She filed charges. 

The system in the State of Florida is criminalizing many of those with developmental disabilities in the year 2002. We had to have my son declared incompetent.  In the behavior arena, the State is destroying the self esteem the developmentally disabled and is demoralizing their parents. 

Please look into The Brown School. See if the information I believe to be correct really is. Please look into the lack of behavioral therapists and the criminalization of those with developmental disabilities. My special needs attorney promises me teachers are having developmentally disabled students arrested all over the state.  And finally, let’s amend the law that says anytime a teacher is hit or kicked by a student, a felony has been committed.  The very young and those with significant developmental disabilities should be exempt.  You have to know that just in Polk County alone over 20 “felonies” a day are being committed by elementary school children with developmental disabilities when they kick or hit their teachers.  Each teacher can chose to deny the student reentry to their classroom and go through due process and/or the teacher can file criminal charges.  More and more teachers are just filing criminal charges.     

Steven’s mom is a single parent and can’t afford the special needs attorney, the criminal attorney, and the expert witness I hired for my son Drew. Steven has a pro bono attorney who is giving the matter a little attention.  Most developmentally disabled kids and their families are thrown out of the education system and into the criminal justice maelstrom without a rudder.  What they need are trained staff and teachers and the active involvement of behavior analysts. 

Your help in doubling the developmentally disabled budget in the last three years has been amazing.  Your help with Noah’s Ark has been amazing.  Steven, his mom, Drew, my wife, myself, and kids all over the state need yet another miracle.

That's eight times bigger than the company said it would be when your

Subject: DPR's problems

Jeb, 
first off I'm a Republican and a film producer so I'm tipping you off
about a national media story that could lead to much embarrassment for
your administration and, which should lead to hearings about the DPR's
many failures to protect the public from scams.
 
Recently,
we've dealt with Rebecca, Chelsea at film 1 and with Gersh from the
Florida Blue Sheet 
about this matter.
Please feel free ask them for the details about our complaints.

As you must know by now we (over 42 plus victims) have had nothing but
problems in getting the DPR
to enforce the state of Florida's laws regarding the regulation of
modeling and talent agencies under Chapter 468 Many local newspapers
have done stories on this issue and the nation media has picked up on
it. 
And, each time that we have complained about this lack of enforcement
our complaints are kicked back to the DPR for a reply but the main
problem is the DPR!!!.

Not only is the DPR clueless about the enforcement of state law,
but they even hamper other agencies efforts while claiming exclusive
jurisdiction.
The  Florida Attorney Generals office, the Hillsborough county consumer
protection agency and TPD
have all  stated this very fact to us. 
Additionally,
all these law enforcement agencies have wondered why the DPR has allowed
these fraudulent scams
 to continue unabated.

The DPR shouldn't be allowed to police themselves when they can't police
this industry or enforce the state laws that they are charged with
enforcing.
Julie Baker and her (personal staff attorney) should be fired for
ignoring all the well documented and reported crimes of these victims. 

I know first hand about this issue because I've been trying to get some
action taken
 on behalf of the many victims for the last year and a half. 
As a victims we've been forced to spend our own funds to investigate and
pursue this matter 
and that's a crime.

Three (3) Tampa area modeling and talent agencies have had a DPR issued
licenses that have allowed them to continually steal from the public
while stealing unreported income tax
and sales tax dollars from the State of Florida. 
We're seeking a solution to this pressing issue before the national
televised segment airs.
I would truly hope that the buck stops on your desk.

Respectfully,
Rick West

Dear Governor Bush,

 

Thank you for taking time to call me last evening!  WOW! I am honored by your personal response!

 

Please accept our invitation to be the honored guest speaker on your Growth Management initiatives at the Tri-County League of Cities luncheon at noon on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday during the weeks of July 9-11 or August 6-8 in Seminole County. We will be flexible to accommodate your schedule, and an alternate date could be arranged with your staff if necessary.

 

The Tri-County League of Cities membership includes all 22 cities of Orange, Seminole, and Osceola counties as well as the counties themselves.  Each month we gather together at alternating locations throughout central Florida to discuss common issues affecting the heart of Florida. As we discussed during our telephone conversation, this engagement would provide an audience of local elected officials, members of the business community and regional leaders.  

 

The exact location would be determined by your chosen date, but will generally be within 30 minutes of Orlando-Sanford Airport or Orlando International Airport. On another note, our luncheons are typically sponsored by the business community to help defray the costs.  Please have your staff contact me regarding the selection of the most appropriate sponsors for an event of this type.

 

Mr. Governor, this occasion will provide excellent exposure for your Growth Management initiatives to the leaders in central Florida who tackle these challenges on the front line, and are the primary contact point for citizens interacting with their government.  I look forward to working with your staff through the planning process.

 

 

With warm regards,

 

 

Michael Blake

Commissioner, City of Winter Springs

 

First Vice President, Tri-county League of Cities

Subject:	Re: ichetucknee cement plant fup

Governor:
I think this issue is being somewhat misrepresented to you.

BASIC FACTS
The 100 acre mine has been there for probably at least 20 years... certainly
well before there was a DEP and before any environmental permits were
required.

When the County made the zoning decisions to allow the cement plant to be
built adjacent to the rock mine, it based that decision on the expectation
of future, expanded mining to support the plant.  This was well understood
by all involved.

Indeed, the company applied for a permit for mine expansion two years ago.
Curiously, during this entire period, not a single protest or objection was
filed by anyone.  The department is now compelled by law to issue the
permit.

I am scheduled to speak to Julie Hauserman about this tomorrow morning.  I
am also schedule to see you in the afternoon.  I will let you know how it
goes.

MORE BACKGROUND
As you know we took the bold step of denying initial permit applications to
build the cement plant because the company had outstanding environmental
compliance problems with other operations.  It is fair to say that under
previous Administrations, they would not have encountered any delays or
objections -- we raised the bar by saying that past performance should count
before new permits are issued.

Eventually, the compliance problems were resolved and restitution was made,
and existing laws compelled the Department to issue the permit to build the
cement plant.

For the past two years, we have filed bills in the Legislature that would
enhance DEP's ability to fairly and predictably consider an applicant's past
performance before new permits are issued.  (For example, we would issue
longer term permits for good performers and shorter term permits for poor
performers.  In exceptional cases, we could determine not to issue a permit
at all.)  The Legislature has not been eager to pass these bills.

Bottom line: we are both executing the law and trying to improve the law.
We are also holding the company more accountable than ever before.  I can
share more on these points with you tomorrow.

Frank and Kathleen are both alert to this issue and are aware of my call
tomorrow.

Thanks,
David

Subject:	A new development in landfill technology.

Importance:	High

Enstech Inc.
Environmental Services and Technologies
 
 
Thursday, May 09, 2002
 
RE: New generations of safe landfill containments that can pinpoint the liner leaks, contain the escaping leachate, and repair the leaks, allowing landfills for the first time in history to be able to be maintained.
 
Dear Sir or Madam,
 
In the 10 years of the R.C.R.A. rules becoming law, every aspect of the way this nation and industry addresses its waste has dramatically improved to better protect our environment, except for landfill containments. The same basic landfill design and technology used 10 years ago is still used today, and all past and present day landfills contain a serious flaw. 
The current landfill designs and systems lack the ability to monitor their barrier liners. The lack of ability to accurately monitor their lining systems prevents today’s lining systems from being maintained. Any science or technology that does not have the ability to accurately evaluate it’s own integrity in regards to its intended purpose and usage by using reliable checks and balances, is flawed and incomplete. The current need for improved landfill science and technology becomes apparent when it is estimated that out of all of the disposal methods used today, 47% of all waste generated goes into landfill containments.
After 10 years of research and development, there is a new science and technology that will allow all new landfills, containments, and their liners to be maintained. I have created a web presentation of the ENSTECH system, showing how the system works in a typical landfill application, on www.enstechinc.com <http://www.enstechinc.com/>  . The web presentation will show how the ENSTECH system will work in pinpointing the leaks, and then contain and repair the leaks in municipal, industrial, hazardous, and cold radioactive landfills. It must be understood that until the ENSTECH system’s development, no previous containment technology has had the ability to accurately find, contain and repair any leaks.
Not shown in this web presentation is the Enstech high heat resistant metal lining system. For an example of the liner module made of heat resistant metal, refer to the diagram at  <http://www.enstechinc.com/diagram.jpg> http://www.enstechinc.com/diagram.jpg . As you watch the web presentation, in your mind, replace all the plastic lining and piping with nuclear grade stainless steel or titanium. This containment system can be used under heat generating sources in industrial manufacture, such as hot caustic or cooling tanks. The same system can be employed under heat generating nuclear material and waste, such as radioactive water, sludges, and solids including used nuclear fuel rods. By using this simple design change, the public and government alike can be assured that no radioactive waste or material has escaped from the containment. The same critical assurance can be made that no out-of-containment water will leak back into the containment. With the development of the Enstech high-heat lining system comes the ability to safely contain and monitor hot waste and materials.
I have sent this same letter to Administrator Whitman, asking for her help in establishing this new containment system as Best Available Control Technology (BACT). I have also asked for her help with all E.P.A. programs and awards that will apply in bringing this technology to this nation. I hope to gain written permission to use the E.P.A. logo endorsement that has been given to other such technologies.
Please review the presentation and write me back with your thoughts and suggestions regarding this new technology. I look forward to your response regarding this matter. 
 
 
 
 
 
Thank you,

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I am writing you to express my support for Allen Register as Circuit Judge in the Fourteenth Judicial Circuit.  I have known Judge Register for almost twenty years now and know of his active involvement in our community.  He has served as our County Judge since 1992 and has the reputation of being a fair and informed judge.  His reputation is such that he has never had an opponent even though he has stood for reelection three times.  I believe Judge  Register holds and reflects the same conservative values most of us here in Washington County hold dear.
 
Because of his experience on the bench; his reputation for fairness; and his belief in conservative values, I believe  Judge Register would make a fine Circuit Judge.

I just spoke to Miguel Southwell at MIA. It looks like we will have a go
ahead from them by tomorrow to call IBERIA and American. Both are now happy
and on board on the new arrangement with US Customs and INS. There will be a
meeting tomorrow (Thursday) afternoon with the airlines to smooth some final
issues, this meeting will largely relates to smaller airlines that have
international passengers connect to other airlines. Miguel has promised to
call us and give us the final go ahead for Governor Bush to make the phone
calls to Iberia and American.

MIA is also planning some press activity, so I would like to get Katy's
people in Communications in touch with the MIA people.

If you could give me the right contact person I can pass it to MIA or if
they prefer they can get with Miguel and his communications people.

I  want to suggest to her that the Governor's declaration gives just praise
to the MIA team for their tireless efforts in resolving this critical issue
and also compliments US Customs and INS for "their spirit of cooperation and
foresight", etc. This would make all parties very happy.

Call me if you have any questions.

Wonderful news ! I just spoke to Miguel Southwell and it appears that INS
and MIA have reached an accord on the in transit passengers  that so far is
acceptable to all airlines. He is awaiting to talk to the front person from
American Airlines who is out until tomorrow to finalize the deal but expects
it will work out.

Miguel and the MIA people give full credit to Governor Bush for making the
resolution of this problem possible. As soon as I receive word tomorrow I
will let you know and strongly recommend that Governor Bush then call Peter
Delara of American and Enrique Donaire. I am sure both Iberia and American
will be very grateful.

I can also help  with whomever you indicate towards producing a press
release and link them with the airport people for appropriate commentary.
This is a very significant coup for Florida Aviation !!

Dear Pam



I just had a lengthy conversation with Ana Sotorrio of MIA on this issue and
she strongly feels that the Governor's intervention could be decisive in
obtaining a favorable resolution on the INS issue and resolving this problem
for our air carriers. She feels that a letter from the Governor to the INS
Commissioner accompanied by a phone call from the Washington office or
yourself, should provide the needed nudge to get INS to reach agreement with
MIA. 

It is a time sensitive issue since they would like to see this issue
resolved by May 15th which is the start of the summer travel season. If you
would like I can start working on a draft along the lines of what we wrote
for the US Customs Commissioner for the INS Commissioner. Let me know.

Unfortunately, Pam, it didn't go at all.  Once again, INS was not available
to meet with us.  It was not until this morning that Miguel Southwell met
with Mr. Jack Garafano, INS Miami District Director, and Port Director Jorge
Roig.  Mr. Garafano claims that he has not seen the Department of Justice
Memorandum for Regional Directors regarding ITI Transit and Progressive
Clearance Procedures, which was issued on April 22,2002.  We gave him a copy
and could not move the conversation beyond the first line of the section of
the memo on ITI Flights, which states "The carrier must provide 100% Advance
Passenger Information (API) electronic data in advance of the aircraft's
arrival."  Mr. Garafano interprets this to mean that air carriers must be
100% APIS compliant. No airline is 100% APIS compliant.  Mr. Garafano's
interpretation is not consistent with ours, or Customs, or the airlines, or
anybody else who understands these issues and has seen the document.  Mr.
Garafano said he needs to review the memo carefully and then call
headquarters.  In the meantime, we are also attempting to get clarification
from INS headquarters.  

If we can get beyond this issue, the next battle with INS will be about
facilities and technology.  Our ITI lounges do not contain INS-approved
inspection booths, nor does the capability exist to conduct IBIS computer
queries.  We can provide the booths and IBIS capability in the future, but
not in time for the peak summer travel season.  At our meeting in
Washington, we were led to believe that INS would work with us on interim
solutions, but given our current experience with INS we are less than
confident that this will be the case.

We could use your help in getting INS Headquarters to clarify the APIS
issue.  We and the airlines interpret the requirement to be 100%
transmission of APIS electronic data - 100% APIS compliance is quite
different and not attainable.

We are still trying to implement the full modified procedures on May 15.
Without INS's cooperation, this will not be possible.  Please call me at
305-876-7533 to discuss this in greater detail.  Thank you.

Big gun takes on Wingate

Jan Schlichtmann, the attorney portrayed in the movie îA Civil Action,' will try to prove a link between chemicals at the landfill and disease around it. 	

Jan Schlichtmann, the attorney portrayed by John Travolta in the movie A Civil Action, has joined the fight over Fort Lauderdale's Wingate landfill.

The Beverly, Mass., attorney won $8 million in 1986 for families who alleged that their children died of leukemia due to pollutants dumped in the Boston suburb of Woburn, Mass.

Now, Schlichtmann and at least eight other attorneys have filed papers to form a new local law firm that will try to prove a link between toxic chemicals buried at the Wingate landfill and high rates of disease around it, primarily in the 33311 and 33313 ZIP codes.

The firm, the Environmental Justice Project, will seek damages from the city of Fort Lauderdale and at least 38 companies that allegedly dumped toxic waste there.

''We're going to approach them and ask them a lot of questions,'' Schlichtmann said. ``We want to do it in an atmosphere in which we're sharing information.''

Schlichtmann's involvement will undoubtedly bring greater attention to a battle that has raged for years. The landfill, at 1300 NW 31st Ave. in Fort Lauderdale, operated from 1954 to 1978. Some residents believe its contaminants are to blame for illnesses they have had.

''We're always willing to sit down and talk,'' said Greg Kisela, a Fort Lauderdale assistant city manager. ``But at this point we have not seen any link between Wingate and any particular illness.''

The city has capped the landfill and wants to create a golf course on the site, a plan which is controversial. Legal Aid Service of Broward County plans next month to appeal the capping plan, which was approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Schlichtmann said it is critical that the community come together to reach a solution -- a lesson he said he learned in the Massachusetts case. ''If anything will be done, it will be because the community comes together,'' he said. ``You can't do it on your own.''

The lawyers, who have kicked in about $500,000 of their own money to get started, hope to reach a settlement without having to sue. They would take a percentage of the settlement, and have not ruled out a class-action lawsuit.

They include Miami attorneys J.B. Harris, Edward Montoya and Buddy Payne as well as Johnny McCray Jr. of Fort Lauderdale, Grover Hankins of Houston -- a former general counsel for the national NAACP -- Tab Turner of Little Rock, Ark., Frederick Kuykendal of Alabama and the law firm of Levin Papantonio of Pensacola.

To quantify the landfill problems -- including a link between the landfill and disease -- the attorneys have hired a private investigator who will look at the site and people living around it.

They also plan to consult doctors, scientists, epidemiologists, sociologists and psychologists to determine whether Wingate residents have suffered any damage.

Some of the 38 companies say they are doing their part to solve the Wingate problem by participating in the EPA-ordered, plastic-capping plan.

''The cleanup has been successfully completed. We were very cooperative,'' said Peggy Palter, spokeswoman for Sears, Roebuck and Co., who added that more than a thousand other companies and the general public dumped in the landfill. ``We did what we were asked to do by the EPA.''

Mike Haggerty, a spokesman for Florida Power & Light, said FPL also has agreed to cooperate with approved solutions to the Wingate problem.

''The group formed to manage and clean up the Wingate site has always supported a study of the health effects,'' Haggerty said, adding that his firm had minimal participation.

Schlichtmann, 51, who also works with a Pensacola law firm, said Wednesday he is trying to gauge whether the community will stand behind the new law firm's plan.

If so, he and other attorneys will form a nonprofit community coalition made up of Wingate area residents named TOXIC, which stands for Team of Exposed Individuals to Contaminants.

Civic activist Leola McCoy, who has long fought to have the Wingate toxins cleaned up properly, showed her support on Wednesday by inviting the lawyers to her home for lunch.

''I think the community needs to understand that it needs to play its part,'' McCoy said.

You have a meeting with Tommy Waits and Jack Healan today.  They will want
to discuss Austin and his renewed contract.  I am certain they will look to
you for your perspectives on change--whether you want change in Visit
Florida leadership or whether you are happy with status quo.  Most on
executive committee of board are leaning towards new leadership; however,
Tommy, Jack, and Peter Guptill (Dollar Rent-A-Car) are less inclined to make
change.  They think that all is good now and that VF is improved, learned
lesson, etc.

I am selecting not to join you for the meeting so that Tommy and Jack can be
as candid as possible.  In that I oversee VISIT FLORIDA contract, they may
share less with you if I am there.

FYI, Tommy was telling folks that we were looking to pull Visit Florida
within OTTED/Gov's Office--thus we were wanted a leader who would support
that.   Obviously, that is not the case.

Mr. Dusik called me yesterday about 2pm to tell me he was sorry for bothering me. I tried to explain it was not him, but the way he got my number that was upsetting. He cut me short by thanking me for Lydia loosing her job and he as well being fired from his because I contacted the state. I am not sure why Mrs. Sherman contacted him again, was it to make me feel bad??? Mrs. Sherman answered her telephone at the state office today so she is not "fired" as Mr. Dusik stated. It might have been best first for Mrs. Sherman to contact me that some one was trying to find me. Let it be my choice. The best practice would be for her to refer to their own service untit for appropriate services for Mr. Dusik's daughter and small grandchildren. Then, had an appoligy come my way it should have been from Mrs. Sherman not Mr. Dusik.  Mr. Dusik didn't violate me, she did. I am use to the way things are done here, some day I hope the Department becomes human and understands "human services"-people.
Thanks for forwarding, if nothing else I am sure they will not do it again. At least to me.

Subject: PhRMA Oral Argument


This is a general note to let everyone know how the PhRMA oral argument went
yesterday.  Without wishing to jinx the matter, I will say that it seemed to
go well for the state.  The bulk of difficult questions were directed to
PhRMA, and the panel seemed to ask whether this case was filed as a result
of lost profits or out of concern for the welfare of Medicaid recipients.
PhRMA conveniently ducked the question.  The questions that were tossed out
to PHRMA were as follows:

Cudahy:  Isn't this a case that will need research of the legislative
history behind SSA 1927(d)(4),  1927(d)(5) and OBRA 90 and 93?

Marcus:  How does the "prior authorization" referenced in D5 nullify the
"formulary" considerations of D4?  

Birch:  Isn't it true that "prior authorization" doesn't really exclude
drugs - but rather only poses an additional step for prescribing parties to
go through?

Birch:  Let's forget the form over substance argument (state statute
inartfully worded - references formulary and preferred drug list
interchangeably) - how does a prior authorization program adversely affect a
medicaid recipients?

Marcus:  What deference should be given to the state legislature's blessing
of the prior authorization scheme and the federal CMS blessing of the prior
authorization scheme?
[PhRMA said no deference to either.  That went over like a lead balloon]

The questions to the state seemed (to my opinion) much simpler and less
heated:

Birch:  Doesn't D4 provide for all drugs (under the federal rebate) to be
covered?  How then can you reconcile D5 with D4?

Cudahy:  How do you reconcile the actions of OBRA 90 and 93 with respect to
this issue?

Cudahy:  Is there any treatise definition of the word formulary that goes
beyond merely a "listing of phramaceuticals"?


It was a relatively short argument (15 minutes each side).  At the end,
Judge Birch asked PhRMA if settlement discussions had occured between the
parties.  PhRMA responded that the parties had followed the scheduling order
(which calls for such).  Birch then suggested (in a throw away comment) that
the parties may wish to continue such discussions "so as to avoid [and here
the record is unclear - he kind of mumbled] either "bad precedent" or "bad
press on it".

Hope this is of help to you all.  The Judges said that a decision would
likely take a while (that could be an indication that they want to see if
the SCT accepts certiorari on Concannon, or that the panel is divided in how
they percieve the case, or that they just have a heavy caseload they are
presently workin with).  I guess we will know when we know.  

Let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Big gun takes on Wingate 
BY BRAD BENNETT 

Jan Schlichtmann, the attorney portrayed by John Travolta in the movie A
Civil Action, has joined the fight over Fort Lauderdale's Wingate landfill.

The Beverly, Mass., attorney won $8 million in 1986 for families who alleged
that their children died of leukemia due to pollutants dumped in the Boston
suburb of Woburn, Mass.

Now, Schlichtmann and at least eight other attorneys have filed papers to
form a new local law firm that will try to prove a link between toxic
chemicals buried at the Wingate landfill and high rates of disease around
it, primarily in the 33311 and 33313 ZIP codes.

The firm, the Environmental Justice Project, will seek damages from the city
of Fort Lauderdale and at least 38 companies that allegedly dumped toxic
waste there.

''We're going to approach them and ask them a lot of questions,''
Schlichtmann said. ``We want to do it in an atmosphere in which we're
sharing information.''

Schlichtmann's involvement will undoubtedly bring greater attention to a
battle that has raged for years. The landfill, at 1300 NW 31st Ave. in Fort
Lauderdale, operated from 1954 to 1978. Some residents believe its
contaminants are to blame for illnesses they have had.

''We're always willing to sit down and talk,'' said Greg Kisela, a Fort
Lauderdale assistant city manager. ``But at this point we have not seen any
link between Wingate and any particular illness.''

The city has capped the landfill and wants to create a golf course on the
site, a plan which is controversial. Legal Aid Service of Broward County
plans next month to appeal the capping plan, which was approved by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency.

Schlichtmann said it is critical that the community come together to reach a
solution -- a lesson he said he learned in the Massachusetts case. ''If
anything will be done, it will be because the community comes together,'' he
said. ``You can't do it on your own.''

The lawyers, who have kicked in about $500,000 of their own money to get
started, hope to reach a settlement without having to sue. They would take a
percentage of the settlement, and have not ruled out a class-action lawsuit.

They include Miami attorneys J.B. Harris, Edward Montoya and Buddy Payne as
well as Johnny McCray Jr. of Fort Lauderdale, Grover Hankins of Houston -- a
former general counsel for the national NAACP -- Tab Turner of Little Rock,
Ark., Frederick Kuykendal of Alabama and the law firm of Levin Papantonio of
Pensacola.

To quantify the landfill problems -- including a link between the landfill
and disease -- the attorneys have hired a private investigator who will look
at the site and people living around it.

They also plan to consult doctors, scientists, epidemiologists, sociologists
and psychologists to determine whether Wingate residents have suffered any
damage.

Some of the 38 companies say they are doing their part to solve the Wingate
problem by participating in the EPA-ordered, plastic-capping plan.

''The cleanup has been successfully completed. We were very cooperative,''
said Peggy Palter, spokeswoman for Sears, Roebuck and Co., who added that
more than a thousand other companies and the general public dumped in the
landfill. ``We did what we were asked to do by the EPA.''

Mike Haggerty, a spokesman for Florida Power & Light, said FPL also has
agreed to cooperate with approved solutions to the Wingate problem.

''The group formed to manage and clean up the Wingate site has always
supported a study of the health effects,'' Haggerty said, adding that his
firm had minimal participation.

Schlichtmann, 51, who also works with a Pensacola law firm, said Wednesday
he is trying to gauge whether the community will stand behind the new law
firm's plan.

If so, he and other attorneys will form a nonprofit community coalition made
up of Wingate area residents named TOXIC, which stands for Team of Exposed
Individuals to Contaminants.

Civic activist Leola McCoy, who has long fought to have the Wingate toxins

Governor Bush:
 
I wanted to let you know that we are seeing substantial success with the pilot project in Sarasota.  Because our agency is a part of the Community Based Care Partnership with the YMCA, we are able to screen and refer children in care directly to the infant/young children mental health pilot as soon as they enter the system or obtain referrals directly from our case managers.  
 
Our infant mental health therapist has been able to work intensely with the biological parent(so) and the targeted child.  All of the goals on these cases is reunification/adoption.  We have been able to reunite 5 out of the original 10 children referred with their parent and 2 are pending.  There have been no  further abuse reports or return to the system.  All of these parents were headed toward termination of parental rights.  While the numbers seem small, the results have not been.  We are using what we are learning from this pilot experience to staff other cases in the partnership differently and move cases to mental health services more quickly. We are learning what resources are lacking that are critical to positive outcomes and how we can use existing resources more productively.  It makes good sense to invest in these families while the children are young and the possibility for success is much higher.  If I can be of any further assistance, please let me know. Thank you.

Gov. Bush, 

The purpose of the infant mental health pilot project is to determine the value of identifying infants and toddlers at high risk for emotional problems and intervening early in development in order to promote healthy mother/baby interactions and relationships, rather than waiting until a child is older and problems are more severe before getting help. 

Approximately 40% of children in foster care are under 5 years of age, and many of them are at high risk for mental health problems because of abuse, neglect, substance abuse, maternal mental illness and domestic violence.  Currently, most infants and toddlers have to wait until they are older and their problems much more severe before they are identified and receive any mental health services.  This pilot project was established to train mental health therapists in infant mental health and to explore effective mental health assessment and treatment services for children under 3 years of age who are in protective services or known to DCF. 

The performance outcome measures include: 
       
1.  Improved measures of attachment and bonding.      
2.  Increased rate of successful reunifications or permanency placements within 12 months time.     
3.  No repeat abuse reports on children enrolled in the study·        
4.  Decreased rate of entry into child welfare system, if not yet involved. 

It is a small N for the study because of the limited funding for 3 sites and we are pioneering new ground here.  However, we feel that we will be able to make recommendations regarding effectiveness at the end of the 3rd year.  We are in the middle of the second year right now.   

You didn't veto it the first 2 years, and I am asking you to once again not veto it for the 3rd year so that we can finish this project. 

Thank you, 
sandra adams

Thank you for taking the time to write, Mrs. Oswalt.  I am very sorry to hear your daughter's needs are not being met in school. I know at least one school board member expressed concern about giving passing grades to children who would not be able to pass the FCAT. I receive quite a bit of mail about the "funding crisis," but have heretofore received very little from concerned citizens about the "learning crisis" - which apparently was never as important to those crusading for more money. Unfortunately, it is my understanding that of the 58% of our students statewide who graduate from high school, less than half of them can read on a third grade level. That trend began long before the current "funding crisis" and while it may have been acceptable to many people over the years, the Governor and legislature are trying to reverse the trend. Fortunately, in part because of the FCAT, your daughter will no longer be overlooked and left to become a future graduate who can not read. The legislature has been researching, evaluating and funding additional reading programs at the state level.  I am not sure which school districts or individual schools are participating in the various programs. Bill

Dear Florida Senators and Representatives, 
        Some people should be singing praises now that we have ended social 
promotion. No more graduates who can't read! Many other parents are now 
angry that their children are going to repeat the fourth grade because they 
didn't pass the FCAT test. I have heard figures stating that 25% of fourth 
graders will be retained! This is unacceptable to me and I hope to you. My 
child will also be retained but I am not one of the surprised ones. I knew 
she needed help and was not getting it. She is a child that would have 
fallen through the cracks in the system had we not had the resources to get 
her help outside the system.  Now I hope she will get the extra help in 
school that she has needed all along. But how will that be possible with the 
budget cuts that have occured? We have identified a problem. That's only the 
first step. What is now going to be done about the problem? Just having 
children repeat a fourth grade curriculum is not going to help them read any 
better. Are more special reading teachers going to be hired? Are we now 
going to focus more on reading at the second and third grade levels? I was 
told that if a child doesn't 'get' reading by second grade that no more time 
is spent just teaching reading. Summer school is gone, so there is no help 
there. What is to be done? Now that this law has passed, how are you 
planning on dealing with the results? I am very interested in hearing your 
reply.

Dear Governor Bush,

As a teacher in Osceola County and as a parent of three children, I am
writing to ask you to continue to support  funding for fast growing
counties.  This funding is needed to continue to effectively educate the
children of Florida.  I am referring  to Section 28, page 416 of the
Budge.  Osceola County has had the fastest growing school system in the
state for the past five years, and is projected to have the fastest
growing school system for the next five years.  In addition, Osceola
County has received the lowest amount, per capita, for school construction
in the state for the past five years.  Osceola County is the only county
in the state that has exhausted all local sources for school construction:
 levying a full 2 mills, sharing in the Local Option Sales Tax, levying
the highest School Impact Fees in the state, levying additional mills for
a School Construction Bond Issue, using all effort index dollars and
classroom 1st dollars, and establishing seven charter schools.  In fact,
Osceola County has one of the highest percentages of students in charter
schools in the State.  

We are slated to receive $8.5 million  of the $10 million approved by the
State Legislature.  We desperately need these dollars to build new
schools.  Please,  in your review of the budget, continue to support fast
growing counties and  DO NOT VETO these critical funds!   Thank You.

Subject:	State Budget. Section 28

Dear Governor Bush,
I am writing to you on behalf of my community and school system: Osceola
County.
I have lived in Osceola for 15 years and have been a teacher in the school
system here for all that time.  I am a Republican and yes - I did vote for
both you and your brother, without having any difficulties with the
ballots!

I am asking you to pay close attention to the state budget this year,
especially the parts that effect education.  In
Section 28 of the Budget, on page 416, there is an item that greatly
impacts my county and our schools.  This item provides money for school
construction to the fastest growing districts, and would mean Osceola
County could receive a large amount of money for construction funds.

As you know, Osceola County has had the fastest growing school system in
the state for the past five years, and is projected to have the fastest
growing school system for the next five years.  At the same time, however,
 Osceola County has received the lowest amount, per capita, for school
construction in the state for the past five years.

On your recent visits to Osceola County, you have commented on how well
our School Board and local governments have developed alternative funding
for education.  You noticed that our county has one of the highest
percentages of students in charter schools in the State.  You may have
also noticed that Osceola County is the only County in the state that has
exhausted all local sources for school construction:
	- Levying a full 2 mills
	- Sharing in the Local Option Sales Tax
	- Levying the highest School Impact Fees in the State
	- Levying additional mills for a School Construction Bond Issue
	- Established seven charter schools
	- Using all effort index dollars
	- Using all classroom 1st dollars

Without a doubt, Osceola County has proven itself as a supporter of
education and as an example of creative and alternative funding.  Osceola
County has done all it can possibly do to keep up with the overwhelming
growth in Central Florida.  We can do no more on our own.  We need - and
we have earned - your help.  This help is the State Budget with Section 28
left intact.  Please maintain that portion of the state budget which would
allow us to provide needed classrooms for the children of Osceola County. 
Programs have been dropped, positions have been cut (including the one I
have held for four years- it was lost when the TLCF Grant was deleted),
and supplies have been neglected, but we cannot do without the space
necessary for educating our students.  Please recognize our efforts here
in Osceola County by providing building construction dollars (all of what
was recommended by the legislature) to the School Districts who need it so
desperately.

Phil,
We have done a background investigation on this person and investigated her

1) The information she claims to have is publicly published information.
She stated to me that she was "working" with the FBI and that they had
provided the info to her.  I personally spoke to the FBI agents that she
referenced in her email to the Governor.  SA Carlos Cintron stated that he
"is not working with this lady on anything".  He further stated that she
calls him about once a month claiming to have "critical information" that
she has developed, but that it is always publicly published info that she
claims to have "hunches on".  Cintron has told her to "stop using his name
or the name of the FBI to gain credibility so as to sell market her
business/product."   Nenortas further claimed to FDLE staff that she was the
person responsible for "cracking the terrorist money ring in South Florida"
related to the 19 terrorists that hijacked the planes on September 11, 2002
and that she was responsible for determining the origin of the Anthrax laced
letters sent out soon afterwards. These revelations apparently come to her
through "hunches" she receives from the news. 
2) We asked her to provide us with the information on the 45 Al-Quida
connected websites and she has yet to produce that info.
3) Subsequent to a conversation with FDLE's Brett Cureton on Wednesday
morning, this lady called the South Florida Water Management District and
asked to speak to their security department.  She stated to them that she
needed to meet with them ASAP to discuss a "viable threat to the south
Florida water supply."  She told them that she was "working with FDLE on
this matter".  It is obvious to me that she is consistently name dropping in
an effort to gain credibility.
4) I have spoken to Ms. Nenortas myself on Wednesday afternoon and
encouraged her to stop claiming that she is "working" with either FDLE or
the FBI.  I explained that while we are more that willing to accept her
"hunches" and information regarding terrorist activities, that she is
creating a problem when she goes from agency to agency claiming to be
working on "viable threats" with a law enforcement agency.  
5) Note that she has a sealed criminal record, having been arrested by Palm
Beach County SO in 1989 for Filing False Insurance Claims.  We are writing
an Intel report in AIM regarding this contact and investigation so that if
anyone else deals with her they will be able to read about this interaction.
Finally, I communicated with SAS Shirley Brody, the supervisor of the South
Florida Domestic Security Taskforce and made her aware of this lady since
she lives in Broward County and continues to create ripples.  SAS Brody was
going to call Broward SO and make them aware of this person.
Please let me know if you want any further action on this matter.

Dear Jeb,
It's been awhile since we've spoken but I wanted to keep you up to date. 
The threats to south Florida appear viable. The lap tops that the gov't
obtained from the two al qiada terrorists, according to officials and what
was posted publicly, had 87 web sites and 45 of those were from south
Florida. (5 water treatment plants along with Ports of Miami and Everglades
were there). 
I am still assisting the head of the FBI's taskforce on cyberterrorism.
I am attempting to see if there is a common thread among the 45 sites. It is
like looking for a needle in a haystack.
Just when you think you have one you reach a wall! (dead end?)
I had noticed the links with the water plants and the ports and notified
Carlos Cintron and Sal Hernandez.
 
This might be helpful to your re-election? and perhaps the investigation
that your brother is going through with the democrats? I don't really know
that but still..... In any case, is there someone on your team that you
would like to be contacted with this?
I am meeting with the water management team of south Florida this morning,
but you can reach me by cell phone if you prefer? 954-980-4374.
I knew you were in Miami the other day. Are you back up north or are you
still down here?
 
As always I wish you nothing but  the best.

Efforts to create certain exemptions from the net ban for disabled folks
have failed, because they don't want our solution which is to have a
particular device on board each individual boat.  Instead, they want to have
a larger mesh and more than 500 square feet.  DIrect conflict with the

Governor, we met with Mr. Pine a couple of times during session (myself,
Jack and Colleen).  There was a lower court decision locally that stated the
FWCC's net rule was invalid and provided fishermen in Franklin, Wakulla and
Jefferson counties the ability to use nets that didn't meet the new FWCC
standard. At the time Mr. Pine and Mr. Crumb were asking for an Executive
Order that would apply the lower court decision to the state so that the
court ordered exemption applied to all.  The First DCA then reversed the
stay that allowed the fishermen in the local counties to use the
"un-approved" nets.  It is my understanding that the First DCA has not made
a decision on the lower court ruling overall.  Mr. Pine and Mr. Crumb have
also been lobbying the legislature as well as our office to get some changes
made to the net rules believing some acts of discrimination have occurred
under the new rules because not all (elderly/disabled) are able to use the
nets that comply with the FWCC standard, thereby taking away their ability
to fish and work.  The judge (Sanders Sauls) in the lower court purposely
stated he was not addressing this issue when he ruled on the rule's
validity.  Colleen and I have talked several times on the issue and believe
Mr. Pine is trying to get around the Constitutional limitations and we don't
have the authority or need to make any changes.  Colleen may have some other
views she'd like to add also?

Governor,

  My name is Walter Pine I am the Executive Director of the Center for Civil
Rights Advocacy. I want to thank you for the time that your staff has spent
in listening to the plight of the Florida commercial fishing families.  We
represent a number of Floridians who believe that their civil rights have
been violated by resource regulations.  The issues are age, disability,
race, and nationality based.  The Center for civil Rights Advocacy has asked
that you issue an executive order or request and opinion from the Florida
Supreme Court that would grant and/or provide for equal access to the
fisheries of Florida.  I have spoken numerous times to Chris Flack and Jack
Furney.  I believe that they have an understanding of the equal access
issues.  They explained that at the time the budget and other legislative
concerns made it impossible for you to give time to these issues.  Now that
the special sessions have been concluded  I would like to have an
opportunity to present the issues to you and answer any questions or resolve
any conflicts that you may have with granting Floridians equal access to
fisheries.

I look forward to your response.

Thank You
Walter Pine

 I would like to urge you to consider vetoing the portion of specific 
appropriation 319A that appropriates $700,000 from DCF for a contract with 
C-NOW. It is for a pilot program to implement an interactive video monitoring 
program in selected foster homes or residential group care facilities. 

The concept of videotaping in foster homes or residential care facilities was 
never discussed in Committee, nor voted on by the House. I believe this is a 
policy decision that requires a thorough discussion as to its pros and cons 
before moving in this direction. In addition, I believe, even if we decided 
to do it, it should go out for bid, not be handed to one company.

Subject: GPA LARGO RESPONSE TO ALABAMA STORY....


Vera,
At the request of Maryann Tolliver, I am sending you a copy of a letter that has been forwarded to all major TV stations and newspapers. We as a group feel this best describes our position on Derby Lane, the kennels, and the relationships that have resulted from our experiences with the above. If you know of anyone willing to listen to OUR side of this issue, please let us know.
 
 
To Whom It May Concern:
In light of the story that broke on 5/22 about the Alabama shootings of thousands of racing greyhounds, I feel compelled to make a plea to your segment. I am a volunteer with GREYHOUND PETS OF AMERICA, LARGO FLORIDA CHAPTER. You may not realize it, but one of the things that is RIGHT with Tampa Bay is the PRO ADOPTION stance that the local greyhound tracks, DERBY LANE and the TAMPA GREYHOUND TRACK have. Just this past weekend, our group had a GREYHOUND PICNIC at Lake Seminole Park, and kennel owners attended just to get a glimpse of their former pupils....The kennels at St. Pete care a great deal about the post racing lives of their greys.  This should be a source of pride for our area, and GPA/LARGO would like to have the opportunity to prove that there ARE tracks and kennels who do care about their greyhounds. For example, last season (2001), I went to  Derby Lane with one of my retired racers I adopted in 1998. While in the elevator, a man smiled at my greyhound, looked at me and said;" Is that Charley?" and began loving on him. Charley's tail wagged happily, and much to my surprise, this man turned out to be one of his trainers. Charley is a black male, with no apparent distinguishing marks from any other black male greyhound, yet, this man remembered Charley from years ago. Charley never broke his "maiden race"..... Likewise, there was the time that one of the prominent kennels at Derby Lane called us to help search for one of their dogs when he accidentally escaped from his family's home months after he had been adopted out. Block after block, road after road, both kennel and family searched. Fortunately, he was found and taken home completely unharmed or injured.
 
Many times, the owners, trainers and workers will visit our third floor booth at Derby Lane just to see one of their former pups, and to meet and speak with the new adoptive family. They meet and exchange stories of lives past and present. Oftentimes both trainers/owners and new "parents" walk away with tears in their eyes. Kennels are reassured  that their "babies" are doing well, and the new owners are blessed with a wealth of knowledge on their greys' personal and professional history. Racing and Retirement meet on common ground with mutual respect and admiration.
 
Our group (GREYHOUND PETS OF AMERICA, LARGO FLORIDA) has many testaments just like the above that can attest to the things POSITIVE about how racing greyhounds are treated by our local tracks and kennels. In the light of stories like Dan Shonka, who sold retired racers to laboratories instead of adopting them out as promised, and the atrocities in this Alabama story, wouldn't it be nice to show that OUR tracks and kennels DO CARE??? Is that not something RIGHT WITH TAMPA BAY?  Derby Lane and the Tampa Greyhound Track are strong supporters of greyhound adoption, and we, as residents of this area should be PROUD of that....With movies like "Oceans Eleven" coming to our area to film, a subtle statement was made that we have a first class act here. Everyone should know that.  Trainers cry when they hand over greyhounds. I have seen it personally. They feel like they are losing a family member. Many, they keep as their own because they just cannot part with them....they call about their former racers to check up on them, they attend our picnics in the hopes of seeing them....
 
A few years ago, Animal Planet featured Greyhounds on their Breed All About It series, and the program chose to feature Derby Lane and Greyhound Pets of America, Largo.  The segment still runs today.  This too should speak highly of our region, and our local tracks' efforts to encourage and promote greyhound adoption. (Copies of this program can be purchased through the Animal Planet Channel.)
 
Do greyhounds make GREYT PETS? Ask us about our 14 yr. old grey girl who saved the life of one of her owners just a couple months ago...(Tierra Verde).
 
Again, is this not one of the MANY things that is RIGHT about Tampa Bay???  Our group is always contacted (this time, by the Tampa Tribune) when a horrific, tragic, and heartbreaking story is exposed. While ALL our hearts break if this story turns out to be true, and we all at GPA/LARGO mourn the senseless loss of greyhounds lives; We feel it is just as important to let people know that in our region, EVERY EFFORT is extended and acted upon to assure that these beautiful, marvelous athletes are given the retirement life they deserve.
 
Thank you in advance for your attention.

Dear Governor Bush:

I am an educator employed by the Osceola School District.  My daughter will 
be in first grade in August and attends an Osceola County School.  I 
understand that the State Legislature has approved $10 million to help fast 
growing counties.  If you support this legislation, Osceola County would 
receive $8.5 million of those funds.  (This item can be found in Section 28, 
page 416 of the proposed Budget.)

We desperately need these dollars to help build new schools in Osceola 
County.  Please take the following points into consideration when it is time 
to sign or veto the proposed legislation:

* Osceola County has had the fastest growing school system in the state for 
the past five years, and is projected to have the fastest growing school 
system for the next five years.

* Osceola County has received the lowest amount, per capita, for school 
construction in the state for the past five years.

* Osceola County has one of the highest percentages of students in charter 
schools in the State.

* Osceola County is the only County in the state that has exhausted all local 
sources for school construction:
- Levying a full 2 mills
- Sharing in the Local Option Sales Tax
- Levying the highest School Impact Fees in the State
- Levying additional mills for a School Construction Bond Issue
- Established seven charter schools
- Using all effort index dollars
- Using all classroom 1st dollars

As both an educator and a parent of a student in Osceola County, I urge you 
to please support this legislation.  

Thank you for your time in reading this.

Governor Bush:

I am a Kindergarten Teacher from Osceola County. I do not want to take up
much of your time, but as you look at the budget please keep in mind the
following facts:

? Osceola County has had the fastest growing school system in the state
for the past five years, and is projected to have the fastest growing
school system for the next five years.
? Osceola County has received the lowest amount, per capita, for school
construction in the state for the past five years.
? Osceola County has one of the highest percentages of students in charter

? Osceola County is the only County in the state that has exhausted all

- Sharing in the Local Option Sales Tax
- Levying the highest School Impact Fees in the State
- Levying additional mills for a School Construction Bond Issue
- Established seven charter schools
- Using all effort index dollars
- Using all classroom 1st dollars

Since you have taken office,  I  have received more money to spend on the
materials my children need. Thank you for that. However, we usually have
25-30 students in the Kindergarten and First grade classes because we do
not have adequate money for building new schools at a rate that can keep
up with our tremendous growth. It is very difficult to give these students
the one-on-one attention they have a right to in such large classes.

I realize you keep giving money to school systems and then wonder where it
all goes. I agree with you there needs to be accountability for this
money. Where is it going? I know of several instances of waste at the
county level, but that is another issue. PLEASE, we have old portables
that have been at this school since I came here 11 years ago. It is not
right for 7-8 year old students to be placed in these old dilapidated
buildings. Thank you for your consideration in this matter. I realize the
job ahead is a difficult one. However, I know you really care about what
is best for the students.

Laura, Secretary Kearney:
Below is the information we have regarding the issues raised in Mr. Sammons
email to Governor Bush.  If you  need additional information, please let me
know.


The following is a response to the main issues raised in the email from Mr.
Sammons, of Noah's Ark to Governor Bush.  The children mentioned in the
email are not clients of the Developmental Disabilities program.  Drew
Sammons,  does not have a qualifying diagnosis under Chapter 393.  The
other child, Steven Graham is not a client and has not been referred to the
developmental disabilities program according to our records.

1. " Brown school claims that they are able to make 50%of those with IQs 50
or below competent to stand trial.  That is absurd"  Children committed to
the Department as incompetent to proceed to trial are served by the Brown
Schools for community competency services and Apalachicola Forest Youth
Camp for residential services (both via contract managed by the Mental
Health program office )  The claim made by Mr. Sammons is correct based on
an OPPAGA justification review  (December 2000) of the Juveniles
Incompetent to Proceed program which reports that competency was restored
for 35% of juveniles below IQ of 50.    Additional data provided by the DCF
Mental Health Program office indicates that 57% of all mentally retarded
juveniles are restored to competency and 43% are not restored.

2.  " If a behavioral therapist had come to Steven's house once a week and
to the school once a week for a year, instead of receiving the Brown's
school instruction, there would have been a much better chance that he and
his single mom , would not be facing the current charges"  We do not know
if these children receive behavioral services from their schools at this
time.  Mr. Sammon's email would lead us to believe they do not.  However,
according to Michelle Polland, Dept of Education, behavior analysis
services may be provided by the schools to children who need this service
as long as it is in their Individual Education Plan (IEP).  The school
should be asked to review the need for behavior analysis services as
suggested by Mr. Sammons.  Dr. Bob Mitty at the Department of Education
oversees behavior services for children in schools.

3   "And finally, lets amend the law that says anytime a teacher is hit or
kicked by a student, a felony has been committed"   According to our
research into this issue (FS 784.081)  the police officer has a range of
charges which may be filed which include misdemeanor to felony.  Therefore
it is not an automatic felony charge each time a teacher is hit.

Hello and Hello,
 
Just wanted to let you know about small business happenings around the state. For starters the Mega entrepreneurial center planned for Orlando is moving along fine, this center located in Orlando should provide a major boost to small businesses in the region, with federal, state and local small businesses  resources all co-located in one major facility. We should have a date for a ground breaking ceremony lined up soon. 
 
In July, SBA in conjunction with the Department of Labor and the White House we will sponsor a  "Women's Entrepreneurial Summit"  with 2000 Florida women business owners in attendance. The venue for the event is Miami. We're on edge, waiting to confirm a date when you'll be available to speak to this group of Florida Women business owners (the fastest growing small business segment) . We also want the President to attend, Pam Dana is working to nail down a date in July. Everything is at a standstill until we get the date (so whatever you can do help expedite a confirmation would be deeply appreciated). Also, SBA loan approvals are up in Florida and a Women's Business Center is slated for Florida. Hope all is well with you and the family, especially with your daughter. I'm going to visit with Sue Cobb in July.  Most of all I hope all is well with you.

The Senate just passed TPA on a vote of 66-30 vote.  Not the vote that the Administration and USTR wanted…they were hoping for 70…but Senator Helms is out for heart surgery and the other 3, I’m sure had significant commitments---they would not have been released.  There remains much work in Conference with the House.
 
Next up is the Supplemental Appropriations bill on Monday, June 3rd, followed by Hate Crimes.  We will roll out a summary of the Supplemental bill as soon as we have a better idea of how it will shape out.  The House is currently debating it and will hopefully pass something tonight (but it’s late).  Quoting Sen Daschle, the Hate Crimes bill will deal w/ “making it easier for states to prosecute hate crimes.”  (Tim we ought to look at this…Dan will be having his baby tomorrow; but, it may take the Senate all week to deal with the Supplemental, so I think we have a few days.)

Dear Mrs. McCoy,

Thank you for your recent e-mail to the Governor regarding your
daughter's
denial in insurance coverage to see a "specialist." This request was
forwarded to the Agency for Health Care Administration, Medicaid Health
Systems Development for response. Your letter describes your difficulty
in
obtaining insurance coverage approval from United Health Care for
consultation and diagnostic testing from The Chiari Center. We are
committed
to assisting your daughter, Courtney and appreciate you bringing this
matter
to our attention. 

In response to your concerns, we plan to contact United Health Care
directly
to request further information and consideration of your daughter's
health
care needs. You may also contact the Agency's Statewide Provider and
Subscriber Assistance Program (SPSAP) which is a State of Florida
program
designed to assist consumers of managed care entities, such as Health
Maintenance Organizations, with grievances that have not been
satisfactorily
resolved. You must first complete the entire grievance process of the
managed care entity before filing a grievance with the program, unless
the
grievance is of an urgent nature. If your grievance meets required
criteria,
the program's staff will schedule the grievance for a hearing before an
independent panel. After the hearing, the panel will make a
recommendation
based on the finding of fact either to the Department of Insurance or
the
Agency for Health care Administration to ensure that your daughter
receives
the quality medical services rightfully due. 

In addition, please find a link below to the Department of Insurance
website
which publishes a consumer guide for Health Maintenance Organizations to
help you in this task. The guide contains basic information and your
rights
and responsibilities as an insurance consumer. You may also contact the
Florida Department of Insurance Consumer Helpline toll-free at
1-800-342-2762.

http://www.doi.state.fl.us/Consumers/guides/newguides2.htm#HEALTH 

Thank you for taking the time to write the Governor in support of your
daughter's health care needs. She is very fortunate to have such a
wonderful
advocate.

Hurricanes 'not a joke,' Bush warns
By Eliot Kleinberg, Palm Beach Post Staff Writer
Thursday, May 23, 2002

TAMPA -- Ten years ago, South Florida businessman John Bush huddled in
the hallways of a friend's home with his wife and children as Hurricane
Andrew raged.

Now, John Ellis Bush is governor of Florida and worries about the
millions of people who were born or moved to South Florida after Andrew.
Or who felt its breezes in Boca Raton or emptied grocery shelves in
Jupiter and believed they had experienced it.

His message Wednesday at the opening of the Florida Governor's Hurricane
Conference: "We're not kidding. It's not a joke."

Bush "is one of the few governors who's been in the eye wall of a major
hurricane," National Hurricane Center Director Max Mayfield mused. "If
any."

Bush, then a developer, had evacuated his home at Deering Bay, near the
coast in southern Miami-Dade County, and had gone west to stay with a
friend. With him had been his wife, Columba; their three children;
Columba's mother; and two Secret Service agents -- he was, after all,
the son of the president of the United States. They arrived around 9
p.m. and waited. No one talked about politics or business. They just
watched the news reports grow more and more grim.

Growing up in Houston, Bush said, "my recollection was it blew a little
bit, it rained a lot. We got to go outside and play in the rain. This
was not like that." 

The children were put to bed about 1:30 a.m. A little more than an hour
later, the house began to shake.

"There was this feeling," Bush said. "It got like the house was going to
implode. It was a very eerie, scary feeling."

Bush told the emergency workers Wednesday their efforts had been steeled
by the Andrew experience and a plague of natural and man-made disasters
since. But he said he is concerned people haven't caught on.

"Human nature is fairly consistent," Bush said. "We all respond to
emergencies when they happen, rather than planning in advance."

Governor Bush:

	Please support the budget legislation (Section 28 on page 416 ) that
provides $10 million to help fast growing counties. Osceola County needs
those funds to help make room for the students who are pouring into our
district.
	We are projected to have the fastest growing school system for the next
five years, yet for the past five years, we have received the lowest per
capita dollars in the state for school construction.
	We've made every effort to overcome the imbalance created by the state's
funding formula. We have the highest school impact fees in the state, we
have a school construction bond issue, and we levy the full 2 mills in
taxes, among other efforts.
	I have lived in this county since 1966, and its population expansion has
been incredible. Please help us to help these students as we all deal with
the effects of growth. It is sad to see so many students whose needs we
can barely meet because we are constantly struggling to build enough roofs
over their heads.

Jeb,
If this article is even partially true you should be ashamed of your support
of these so called "drug treatment" programs. When are you ever going to
learn that the "drug problem" is not a criminal issue but a medical problem.
If people commit "drug abuse" then they should be helped, if they are
casual, non-violent users or small tme sellers they should NOT be terrorized
by the STATE. I know freedom is an alien concept to many politicians and
your stance on the drug war is certainly anti-freedomt.

The article states "Betty Sembler co-chaired Jeb Bush's campaign committee.
In return, the governor declared Aug. 8, 2000, "Betty Sembler Day" in
Florida — due, he said, to her work "protecting children from the dangers of
drugs."

She also serves on the board of DARE, the largely failed anti-drug program
for elementary school students." Based on what I have read this woman should
be "tarred and feathered" and not be honored.

I know you have very limited time but would be interested in knowing if you
have any real, detailed knowledge of this program.  Or are you just relying
on your "advisors".

FOX News

By Radley Balko


Samantha Monroe was 12 years old in 1981 when her parents enrolled her in
the Sarasota, Fla., branch of Straight Inc., an aggressive drub rehab center
for teens.


Barely a teen, Samantha also had no history of drug abuse. But she spent the
next three years of her life surviving Straight.

She was beaten, starved and denied toilet privileges for days on end. She
describes her "humble pants," a punishment that forced her to wear the same
pants for six weeks at a time. Because she was allowed just one shower a
week, the pants often filled with feces, urine and menstrual blood. Often
she was confined to her closet for days. She gnawed through her jaw during
those "timeout" sessions, hoping she'd bleed to death.

She says that after she was raped by a male counselor, "the wonderful state
of Florida paid for and forced me to have an abortion."

There are hundreds of Straight stories like Samantha's. Wes Fager enrolled
his son in a Springfield, Va., chapter of Straight on the advice of a high
school guidance counselor. Fager didn't see his son again until three months
later — after he'd escaped and developed severe mental illness.

Since then, Fager's set out to clear the air on Straight. He has accumulated
stories like Samantha's and his son's on a clearinghouse Web site. They are
stories of suicides and attempted suicides, rapes, forced abortions,
molestations, physical abuse, lawsuits, court testimonies, and extensive
documentation of profound psychological abuse at Straight chapters all over
the country.

Yet, the Straight model of drug treatment is thriving, with the trend toward
"boot camp" style rehab centers growing more and more en vogue and
Straight's founders, high-powered Republican boosters Mel and Betty Sembler,
wielding enormous influence over U.S. drug policy.

Mel Sembler is currently serving as President Bush's ambassador to Italy,
and the Semblers serve on the boards of almost every major domestic
anti-drug program. They are longtime close associates of the Bush family,
and are behind efforts to defeat medicinal marijuana initiatives all over
the country. Despite the horrors that have surfaced about Straight's
history, they are proud and unrepentant about the program.

With more and more U.S. states turning to mandatory treatment instead of
incarceration for minor drug offenses — with Mel and Betty Sembler
continuing to flex political muscle in the power corridors of the drug war —
the story of Straight is one worth hearing.

Straight was spun off of a Synanon, Fla., based rehab program called The
Seed. Established in 1972, the program lost its funding after a
congressional investigation turned up evidence of brainwashing and cult-like
mind control tactics. But a Florida congressman named Bill Young persisted.
He found advocates in the Semblers and persuaded them to start a similar
rehab center in St. Petersburg, which they called "Straight Incorporated."

Despite allegations of abuse from escaped members and pending lawsuits, over
the next 15 years Straight won laudatory praise in Republican circles.
Luminaries from Nancy Reagan to Princess Diana visited Straight branches and
touted their successes (though by most estimates only about 25 percent of
Straight "clients" ever completed the program).

But Straight's tactics soon caught up to it in the courts. A college student
won a false imprisonment claim of $220,000 in 1983, and another claim cost
Straight $721,000 in 1990. A Straight spin-off called Kids of North Jersey
lost a $4.5 million claim in 2000. Straight chapters across the country
began to shut down, culminating with the last branch in Atlanta closing in
1993.

But the Straight philosophy was far from finished. Many chapters and
directors reopened new clinics that employed the same tactics under
different names — such as KIDS, Growing Together and SAFE. Florida Gov. Jeb
Bush visited and praised SAFE, despite the fact that an Orlando television
station reported widespread Straight-like abuse at the facility in a 2000
expose.

Amidst mounting lawsuit losses and bad publicity throughout the 1990's, the
umbrella organization Straight Inc. changed its name in 1996 to the Drug
Free America Foundation. DFAF thrives today with $400,000 in annual federal
subsidies.

"It amazes me that despite the pattern of complaints and abuse allegations,
Straight chapters can simply change their names and continue to operate,"
says Rick Ross, a cult expert and intervention specialist. Ross says there's
an unfortunate market for "rehab" centers that take burdensome children off
the hands of troubled parents.

Most troubling, however, is the considerable and continuing political clout
of Straight Inc.'s founders. Former President Bush once shot a television
commercial for DFAF, and designated the Semblers' program as one of his
"thousand points of light."

Long a presence in Florida Republican circles, Mel Sembler was tapped as
ambassador to Australia in 1989. Today he serves the younger Bush as
ambassador to Italy, and he served on the board of the 2000 Republican
National Convention.

Betty Sembler co-chaired Jeb Bush's campaign committee. In return, the
governor declared Aug. 8, 2000, "Betty Sembler Day" in Florida — due, he
said, to her work "protecting children from the dangers of drugs."

She also serves on the board of DARE, the largely failed anti-drug program
for elementary school students.

DFAF also worked with then-governor Bush on anti-drug programs in Texas, and
today claims to have his ear on national drug policy as well. Indeed,
Arizona prosecutor and Sembler favorite Rick Romley was on Bush's short list
for drug czar. Though Romley wasn't nominated, Bush did tap staunch drug
warrior John Walters. The nomination caused Betty Sembler to remark, "....
we have lacked the leadership and support of the White House ... until now."

"It's really shocking that the Semblers are still lauded and honored after
all that's come out about their organization," says cult expert Ross, a
self-described Republican.

Last year, a reporter from the Canadian e-zine Cannabis News asked Betty
Sembler in person about the horror stories he'd read from Straight
survivors. "They should get a life," Sembler replied. "I am proud of
everything we have done. There's nothing to apologize for. The legalizers
are the ones who should be apologizing."

That's the attitude of the drug war's power duo, who can be unrepentant
about the lives their program destroyed because they believe a
win-at-all-costs approach is the only way to remove the scourge of drugs
from society. Shattered lives, suicides, forced abortions, fractured
psyches — all necessary casualties of the drug war, and nothing to apologize
for.

New Tampa Schools Score Well On FCAT
By LENORA LAKE and MICHELE SAGER The Tampa Tribune 
Published: May 23, 2002
   
TAMPA - Some schools credited tutoring and mentoring programs for high FCAT scores in reading and math, while struggling schools searched for reasons why results remain below average. Most New Tampa schools scored above the county and state averages on the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test. Scores were released last week by the state Department of Education. Mary Frances Ledo, assistant principal of Clark Elementary, said increased parent involvement and the use of volunteer reading tutor programs throughout New Tampa helped the schools. Ledo said Clark's after-school extended- learning program in part helped her students achieve scores well above the Hillsborough County average. ``Clark was fortunate because many of the teachers in third and fourth grade were the ones who stayed after school and taught in it,'' Ledo said, adding that the teachers knew many of the children and their specific needs. But not all New Tampa schools were celebrating their scores. Wharton High's ninth- and 10th-grade scores in reading and math were below the county average. Principal Mitchell Muley pointed out that Wharton draws from middle schools with varying levels of success in preparing their students for high school. ``We see a big difference in improvement between ninth grade and the 10th grade, when we have had them [the students] for more than a year,'' Muley said. In fact, 10th-grade scores were just 1 point below the county average and above the state average. Wharton's block schedule also may be a disadvantage for students taking the FCAT. Under block scheduling, a ninth-grader may not take math or English the first semester of the school year. This means a student would have that subject only from January until when the test is administered in February or March, Muley said. Some previously struggling schools showed little improvement despite new programs to boost achievement. Scores at Mort and Shaw elementary schools, where the district started school-within-a- school programs, were below county averages. Both schools were given extra resources by the district to create two minischools at each site, one for younger students and one for older elementary students. By creating two smaller schools, educators had hoped to improve academic performance. But both Mort and Shaw students scored low marks on all portions of the FCAT. Mort Principal Lamar Hammer said this year's FCAT scores may not be an accurate measure of the success of the program. ``It may take a few years before we see significant results on test scores,'' he said. ``We were very surprised by the scores because our students have shown so much improvement in class.'' School districts should get individual student scores Friday and will make them available to families. Scores from some students - including those in exceptional education classes and those with limited English proficiency - will not be factored into each school's grade from the state, expected by mid-June.

Kathleen,
 
We have worked this issue almost daily and finally feel that we have a good handle on all the nuances----it is a very complicated situation (sometimes we feel we know more than Jorge’s lawyers!).  We have run the traps at both the Patent and Trademarks Office (PTO), and the State Dept.  
 
Best strategy-----at this time, our recommendation is that the Governor write to the newly appointed Director of PTO, Jim Rogan (former CA Congressman).  The process is essentially a judicial process…so we must be somewhat careful not to “cross lines,” but since the Governor is writing on behalf of his constituent, and to the Director, not the Board that’s making the ultimate decision…we’re OK.
 
Also, Jorge has been urging us to write to the State Dept about a similar decision pending at Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).  We spoke with Alan Larson, Under Secretary for Economics, Business and Agricultural Affairs.  He has been working w/ Jorge as much as we have…a letter to Alan is not necessary at this time and could actually complicate matters.  Governor should hold off sending any letter to the State Department.
 
Attached is our draft.  We asked Jorge to review the facts.  He cleared up a few items and we’re good to go.  If Gov decides to send letter, pls fax signed copies to us…we will send to staff.  Pls also fed-ex original and we will hand-deliver to PTO.
 
Thanks.  Nina.

Governor Bush:

If you or your staff would send this letter to Secretary Kearney, I
would be eternally grateful. 

                  


                  21 May 2002



The Honorable Kathleen Kearney, Secretary  
Florida Department of Children & Families 
1317 Winewood Blvd., Building 1, Room 202
Tallahassee, Florida 32399-0700


Dear Secretary Kearney: 


The Department of Children & Families is committed to working in
partnership with local communities to ensure safety, well-being and
self-sufficiency for the people we serve.  ----Florida Department of
Children & Families, Mission Statemet. 

In recent weeks, it has been found that the Florida Department of
Children & Families has not fully met its requirements to ensure that
all children under its care are safe, and free from harm. In the case of
Rilya Wilson questions, reasonably raised, about the state's performance
in protecting children in the child welfare system are very troubling.
It is essential that these issues are resolved quickly and that our
child welfare system is equipped with the tools necessary to guard
against failures similar to this in the future. 

In the few weeks after the Rilya tragedy, our Governor Jeb Bush and the
Florida Legislature passed and signed into law, House Bill 71-E,
tailored specifically to prevent caseworkers that will not live up to
the high standards established by law, from falsifying records and
getting away with it.

This law sets penalties for those who would try to circumvent the law by
falsifying official state records of persons under the care and custody
of the state of Florida. In addition, it provides for 15 years in prison
for any record falsified that would eventually cause bodily harm or
death to any child under the state's care and supervision. 

I commend the leadership of our Governor nd the Legislature, and
yourself madam Secretary in confronting this problem head on, and trying
to use all available resources to adequately deal with it. 

A few days after the tragedy, the Governor formed a Blue Ribbon Panel
commissioned to provide an interim and definitive set of recommendations
for DCF to better fulfill its mission, and goals. 

I sincerely hope, that these recommendations will encourage DCF to look
at what needs to be done, what has been done, and what will meet the
needs and safety of every child under its care for the 21st century. 

Its so very important that DCF make systemic changes, because so many
children and families depend upon your agency, madam Secretary for their
very livelihood. 

In this context, we need to look beyond the action of a few caseworkers
that do not meet the high standards, and high demands our law and the
Department places on them; and look to the hardworking, committed
caseworkers across our state, working tirelessly, day in and day out to
help our most vulnerable---our children chart the path to live out their
dreams. 

As a foster kid, here in Leon County, who happens to have benefited from
one such person, Katherine Smith, I see the need, and the eventually
inevitable urgency for affirmative action.  In the end, the long run,
this finally tears down a wall, built steadily over the years, that has
blocked the voice, and potential of so many kids throughout our state.  


God bless.

							Sincerely,


						      Chris Timmons

Dear Jeb, 

How are you?  I am trying email instead of a call.  I am getting some
letters and phone calls from abstinence providers about the Florida
Department of Health and an apparent  shift in direction that the department
seems to be headed regarding abstinence education.

Abstinence educators report to me that the Health Department is trying to
satisfy certain vocal members of the state legislature by pushing evaluation
so hard as to set up this program for failure.  The ultimate result may be
that fewer adolescents will be served and ultimately fewer abstinence
education programs will exist in Florida.

Knowing you and your support for abstinence I believe you would find that
unacceptable.  Florida's commitment to abstinence education leads the nation
and any decrease in its programs would be a significant blow felt across the
country.  

Please review the attached letter and memo I am sending to Dr. Agwunobi.  It
lays out the issue and recommends a process to come to consensus on the
issues addressing abstinence education.

Thank you for all that you do for our state!  I hope to see you soon.

Sincerely, 

Dave Weldon, M.D. 
Member of Congress

Hi Governor,
 
I understand from our Tallahassee representatives that SB 100 has been delivered to you.  They said that HB 69-E, which is the bill that gave us a year's reprieve, has not been sent yet.  In looking at HB 69-E, Section 3 states that "section 1 of Senate Bill 100, 2002 regular session, is repealed".   I have heard some say you must still veto SB 100 - I'm not sure.
 
I did hear that you are considering vetoing both SB  100 and HB 69-E.  That would not hurt my feelings, since that would but us back where we were, which was trying to fix out para transit service.  There has been alot of discussion regarding "home rule issues" which started with the passage of SB 100.  If HB 69-E becomes law, we will have to go back next year to prove that we are worthy of continuing as the CTC for Central Florida prior to June 30, 2003 in order to prevent this from occurring again next year.
 
I am confident that you will do what you believe is best for the customers of the para transit service.  I believe that we are headed in the right direction to improve our agency overall and especially the para transit issue, without intervention from the state.  We have a number of issues we are working on, but Lynx did not get were it is today overnight and we cannot fix it overnight either.  
 
I appreciate your expression of confidence in me by appointing me to the Lynx board.  I am working hard to utilize my business knowledge and experience to strengthen the Lynx Board and make you proud of your decision to appointment me to this agency.
 
Warmest regards,
 
Brenda Carey

Looking around this town and reading Carl Hiassen's editorial about St. Joe
and the "Great Northwest", I'm REALLY considering voting Democratic next
election. The grant money that you've sent down here is being funneled VERY
carefully into private enterprise by Baskerville Donovan, Freda White, Ben
Watkins, etc. The ignorant City Commissioners are considering a "new" PUD
proposal but can't tell me WHY. I can tell THEM why, though...right now
developers are limited to 2 stories on any buildings BUT, since an option
has been put down on some PRIME waterfront property down here AND since
Baskerville Donovan is pushing to get MORE money from state grants to "help"
us develop water and sewer further (first out to the golf course being built
and now.....for the condos I'm SURE are being considered for THAT property),
this place truly WILL be turned into the mess that Carl Hiassen was talking
about in his article. Let's just turn this picturesque little fishing
village into ANOTHER Destin....with the help of state funding, of course!

Meanwhile, our schools are in desperate need of help but, since Baskerville
Donovan can't scrape 20% off the top of any educational funds, they're not
being helped. The water sewer project that is going on now is a JOKE! Things
have to be torn up 4,5,6....even 7 times in one place...thanks to the LACK
of engineering and knowledge. Replacement sewer lines are NOT going back to
where they came from (in our case, the alley which is a city easement) but
rather, NEW places are being torn up and dug up. If the city is NOT going to
use their easements for water and sewer lines, why not just close the
alleys? And, at the end of it, everyone will wonder WHY there were so many
cost over-runs....AARRRGGHHHH!

I'm just sick about the whole mess and Baskerville Donovan is even asking
DEP and DCA to rush their approvals through, which will probably be done.
They hint that they have some "ins" there, anyway. State funding should NOT
be given to a town like this without State oversight! Not when we have an
illiterate mayor who has to sign off on all these "miracle grant funds"!
Asking BDI to oversee it is like asking the fox to guard the henhouse. Sure
they can solicit grant funds and take THEIR money off the top of that, then
WE have to live with inadequate work being done because of lack of knowlege.
*sigh*

Amie, 
I am so pleased to know the decision has been overturned and your daughter
can see the specialist in New York. I hope the evalution will bring forth
positive results to help Courtney with her complex health care needs. If
there is anything we can do to assist further, please don't hesitate to
contact me.

Dear Michelle,
Thank you so much for replying to my letter concerning my daughter.. I
wanted to let you know that I was denied and did the appeal process and we
were just notified on Friday that the denial was overturned by a physician
in California that reviewed the case & we are able to go to the "Chiari
Clinic" to see Dr. Milhorat!!!  We have a appointment for June 7th with 2
days of testing the 5th & 6th.  Someone finally saw all of her
reports/surgery notes and newly diagnosed conditions & realized we needed
this approval.. Thank you so much for all your time & help for us..  I will
do whatever it takes to get her the care she needs & deserves.. It so hard
to see your little one having such a hard time..
Thanks Again,

Amie McCoy

I can talk only about respite because that is the only service that I am
getting sometimes for my child, not that I don't need any other services
for my child but living in Osceola County that is depraved of everything,
bare with me. As a respite provider I know what the parents would like .
Our children shouldn't be limited as far as place to respite. Any Child day
care of Family Day care licensed by DCF should be able to accommodate
respite. Respite shouldn't be limited, providers should be able to take
those
children OUT, like at any theme park or libraries or park and recreation,
like a companion who can take anywhere the consumer.
Parents should have a choice where respite should be provided. I feel like
we are putting our children in a cage by giving limitations
of place of respite. Who ever agree with me, just do like I do, give your
opinion and send it to Tallahassee or to Donna Rauber our co-chair for FCC
District 7. Thanks
It is important that we speak now....

Dear Governor Bush,
We are facing an educational crisis here in Osceola County.  Osceola
County has had the fastest growing school system in the state for the past
five years, and is projected to have the fastest growing school system for
the next five years.  Osceola County has received the lowest amount, per
capita, for school construction in the state for the past five years. 
Osceola County has one of the highest percentages of students in charter
schools in the State.  We need legislative dollars in order to build new
schools.  Several of our elementary schools house over 1200 students (in
buildings that were constructed to hold 700 students).  Please consider
Osceola County for additional funding.  The education of Florida's
children depend on your support.

Governor:  As a principal in Osceola County, I can't tell you how
important the money set aside in the budget for fast growing counties is
to our school district.  Every year we struggle with tremendous growth,
crowded classrooms and discouraged teachers with low pay because money has
to go toward growth instead of teacher and employee raises.  You have been
to our district a couple of times this year and surely you saw the needs. 
Put aside the politics of cutting spending on this issue.  Don't demand of
us another year of "making do"  Our schools and district are bursting and
we need help.  Thanks for reading this.

Dear Honorable Governor Bush,

I am sending this email in the hopes of persuading you to sign the budget
item in Section 28 on page 416.  This will provide Osceola County School
District with an extra 8.5 million in funds for construction.  

Osceola County has had the fastest growing school system in the state for
the past five years, and is projected to have the fastest growing school
system for the next five years.

Osceola County has received the lowest amount, per capita, for school
construction in the state for the past five years.

Osceola County has one of the highest percentages of students in charter
schools in the State.

Osceola County is the only County in the state that has exhausted all
local sources for school construction:
- Levying a full 2 mills
- Sharing in the Local Option Sales Tax
- Levying the highest School Impact Fees in the State
- Levying additional mills for a School Construction Bond Issue
- Established seven charter schools
- Using all effort index dollars
- Using all classroom 1st dollars

Thank you so much for your consideration.  Keep up the good work.

Governor Bush,

I am writing this email as a concerned citizen as well as a concerned
educator.  I am employed by the Osceola County Board of Education. 
Currently my position is Pre-K Exceptional Student Education Program
Specialist.  I am amazed as to the number of very young children who have
moved into Osceola County who are exhibiting developmental delays and/or
other disabilities.  It is crucial that Osceola County receive as much
money as possible to help these young children receive a strong foundation
on which they can build a successful future.  It is extremely difficult to
do this when classes are so overcrowded.  Unfortunately, funding (or
rather lack of appropriate funding) is the main element that stands in the
way of our children's success.  We have an outstanding team of educators
in Osceola County.  I understand that the State legislature has approved
$10 million to help fast growing counties.  I beseech you not to veto
this.  Please consider the following points when determining the need for
added funds to Osceola County Schools:



1. Osceola County has had the fastest growing school system in the state
for the past five years, and is projected to have the fastest growing
school system for the next five years.

2.  Osceola County has received the lowest amount, per capita, for school
construction in the state for the past five years.

3.  Osceola County has one of the highest percentages of students in
charter schools in the State.

4.  Osceola County is the only County in the state that has exhausted all
local sources for school construction:
- Levying a full 2 mills
- Sharing in the Local Option Sales Tax
- Levying the highest School Impact Fees in the State
- Levying additional mills for a School Construction Bond Issue
- Established seven charter schools
- Using all effort index dollars
- Using all classroom 1st dollars

(Budget, Section 28, page 416)

Dear Governor Bush,

Greetings in the mighty name of Jesus our soon coming King.

I am writtng in support of funds for the Osceola County Schools. Our
district is undoubtedly the fastest growing system in this area.  It's
recognition as such can be vividly seen as we take a look at our new
home sales record. In the little area of Poinciana some 400 new families
are moving in on a monthly basis.  Deerwood elementary school which goes
from PreK through 3rd grade is home to at least 1058 students.

Please vote yes for the funds allocated by the State Legislature, we
desperately need these dollars to build new schools. Our county has
eshausted all local sources for school construction. Please don't turn
your back on us.

I am praying and beleiving that God will speak to your heart so that you
will vote in favor of our School District's desparate needs for more
dollars for our schools.  I close in Jesus name.

Dear Governor Bush -

As a 43 year resident of Osceola County, as well as a teacher whose career
in the Osceola District began in 1971 and culminated in being selected
District Teacher of the Year for the 2001/2002 school year, I am writing
to ask you to please support the funding provided to our district in the
proposed Budget, Section 28, page 416.

Not only has the Osceola District tapped all available funding sources,
for the past five years we have been the fastest growing district in the
state, while receiving the lowest amount per capita for school
construction in Florida.

And our test results show the lack of commitment from our state leaders,
as year after year we are at the bottom of the districts in Central
Florida in all aspects of the FCAT.

Please "walk your talk" and sign the bill which appropriates some special
funding for the Osceola District Schools.  After doing so, please contact
me and I will gladly serve on your re-election campaign in our area.

Thank you.

Dear Governor Bush,
Please support the funding for fast growing counties in the new budget
(section 28, p. 416).  The county where I teach (Osceola) has been the
fastest growing school system in the state for the past 5 years and we
really need the money to improve student learning.  We have already levied
our full 2 mills and use the local option sales tax to try to keep up with
the need for new schools.  We have opened seven charter schools  and use
all the dollars available to us through other legislative programs.  This
budgeted  money is crucial to our county.  It would be nice if teachers
and administrators could focus more on improving student learning instead
of where to put a student when there is no money for new classrooms.  This
money will make that more possible.  Thank you for your support.

Governor Bush,
     I would just like to take a minute of your time to appeal to you to
support the funding for Osceola county schools.  I work in the school
system and see on a daily basis the extreme need for such funding.  We are
the fastest growing county for the past five years and are projected to
remain so for the next five.  We receive the lowest amount per capita in
construction and have the highest percentage of charter schools.  We have
also exhausted all local funding in our county.  I'm sure these are
statistics you know well but I thought they were worth mentioning.  Thank
you so much for your time and your help in this crisis would be greatly
appreciated.

As incoming citizens pursue the American Dream, they choose Osceola
County as their residence. As a seasoned educator of 22 years, I have
seen the growth in this county quadruple. Osceola High School is
projected to house over 2300 students this Fall. That is more than 150
students from the 2001-2002 school year. These numbers significantly
increase every year. Taking into consideration that the county has more
than 35 schools, this growth is overwhelming. Our growth is not constant
with the number of schools currently being built. Schools are becoming
portable cities and our children need a better learning environment.
Your support is desperately needed. Please consider giving back to the
communities by helping us build more schools, so our students can give
back to society. Yours Truly,Glidden Nieves.Thank you.

Dear Mr. Bush:

I am currently serving as a school psychologist with Osceola County
Schools. In this position, I work with a wide variety of students,
teachers, and parents.  Therefore, I have the opportunity to assess the
evergrowing concerns about our student's education.  

We service children of many different ethnic and socioeconomic
backgrounds, which of course offers it's challenges.  As such, I have
found that many students need services that are simply unavailable due to
a large and growing student population and limited funding.  We have been
notified that we may be able to receive extra funding.  My e-mail is
simply to request that you allow our students to receive this money.  Our
classrooms have as many as 35 children in a room, and no assistant.  This
may work for children with average intelligence, but what of the children
below average intelligence who do not qualify for exceptional student
education?  They need extra help that is not available with the number of
students in a regular class.  Otherwise, we risk failing these children,
and not allowing them the opportunity to become productive citizens
through education.  

Please do not veto the money available to our school district.  This could
truly make a difference in our children's lives.  

Sincerely,
Kendra P. Belson, Ed.S., BCABA

Subject:	Help for Osceola County schools

Dear Governor,

Please do not veto the funds to help Osceola county schools found in
Section 28 page 416 of the budget.  Osceola County schools are suffering
from the large influx of students.  I teach special education students at
the high school level.  I had as many as 30 students in my room last year,
and the room is 1/2 the size of regular classrooms.  

I do not know if you are familiar with special education students, but it
is best if they have space between them  to help with their
distractibility.  Currently, my students sit one on top of the other.  I
am worried.  I have seen my caseload for next year, and I have over 24 in
three classes.  My students range in reading levels from 1st grade to 10th
grade, and they range in age from 14 to 21 years of age.  It is a
challenge to engage all of these levels, but with so many students in a
classroom it becomes quite difficult.

I am more worried when I drive around our county and see more and more
apartments going up.  People want to live in Osceola County, and our
county has exhausted so many efforts to accomodate their students, but it
is not enough.  We need your help.  As the Education Governor, won't you
please recognize that Osceola County is in need.  The teachers won't let
you down.

Thank you.

Dear Jeb, (May I call you Jeb?)

It is my understanding that  the State Legislature approved $10 million to
help fast growing counties and that you are in the process of reviewing 
the budget, and may veto it.  This email is to ask you to please, please
reconsider! Osceola county is one the faster growing in Central Florida
and it is projected that this grow will continue.  These funds are very
much needed.

Take my school for example, we are only 2 years old and we were
overcrowded this past school year and we are projected to be overcrowded
again next school year!  With this much grow new schools would need to be
built.

When reviewing the budget, please consider the following and think, think
very hard how this is going to affect the children in Osceola county, a
county with high number of non-English speaking Students. 

Osceola County has received the lowest amount, per capita, for school
construction in the state for the past five years.

 Osceola County has one of the highest percentages of students in charter
schools in the State.

Osceola County is the only County in the state that has exhausted all
local sources for school construction:

This is excellent, Shelley.

The key problem with the current funding system is that the money goes
directly to the state's central bureaucracy and then to the school district
bureaucracies.  Our challenge is to get the money past all of these folks
and into the classrooms.

It will never be a matter of how much money is allocated for school, it's a
matter of how closely the money follows the student.

Best of luck,
Marie

Dear Mr. Sammons:

Thank you for your May 22 e-mail to Governor Bush regarding your concerns
with Brown School.  Governor Bush asked me to respond to you on his behalf.

The children mentioned in your email are not clients of the Developmental
Disabilities program.  Our records indicate that Drew does not have a
qualifying diagnosis under Chapter 393.  The other child, Steven Graham is
not a client and has not been referred to the developmental disabilities
program according to our records.  In reference to your statements, I offer
the following comments.

1. " Brown school claims that they are able to make 50%of those with IQs 50
or below competent to stand trial.  That is absurd."  Children committed to
the Department as incompetent to proceed to trial are served by the Brown
Schools for community competency services and Apalachicola Forest Youth
Camp for residential services (both via contract managed by the Mental
Health program office).  The claim made is correct based on an OPPAGA
justification review (December 2000) of the Juveniles Incompetent to
Proceed program which reports that competency was restored for 35% of
juveniles below IQ of 50.    Additional data provided by the DCF Mental
Health Program office indicates that 57% of all mentally retarded juveniles
are restored to competency and 43% are not restored.

2.  " If a behavioral therapist had come to Steven's house once a week and
to the school once a week for a year, instead of receiving the Brown's
school instruction, there would have been a much better chance that he and
his single mom, would not be facing the current charges."   We do not know
if these children receive behavioral services from their schools at this
time.  Your email would lead us to believe they do not.  However, according
to Michelle Polland, Department of Education, behavior analysis services
may be provided by the schools to children who need this service as long as
it is in their Individual Education Plan (IEP).  The school should be asked
to review the need for behavior analysis services as you suggested.  Dr.
Bob Mitty at the Department of Education oversees behavior services for
children in schools.

3   "And finally, lets amend the law that says anytime a teacher is hit or
kicked by a student, a felony has been committed."   According to our
research into this issue (FS 784.081) the police officer has a range of
charges which may be filed which include misdemeanor to felony.  Therefore
it is not an automatic felony charge each time a teacher is hit.

I hope you find this information helpful.  If you need anything further,
please let me know.  Best wishes to you and the families at Noah's Ark.

Jeb:
First, all of the parents and kids at Noah's Ark appreciate your support.
It has been essential. And thanks for your help and participation with the
Family Café.
This email is to let you know of a practice of the State of Florida, a
practice that I believe you would work to stop immediately if you knew
about it.
I am working as a volunteer advocate for Steven, a 5(superscript: th)
grader with significant development disabilities. He appears to be
somewhere on the autism continuum. In the third grade Steven was arrested
for hitting his teacher.  For the next year instructors from The Brown
School came to his house twice a week, for an hour to two hours a session,
in an effort to train him to be competent so he could be prosecuted for
hitting his teacher. After a year they were unsuccessful.  Steven was not
prosecuted.
The Brown School is a company contracted by the State of Florida, and I am
guessing at the direction of the state attorneys and/or judges, to train
the developmentally disabled charged with crimes to become competent to
stand trial. What I can't understand is that a representative of the Browns
School boasted that approximately 30 percent of the people they work with
have IQ's of 50 or below. They claim they are able to make 50% of those
with IQ's 50 or below competent to stand trial. To me, this is absurd.
Back to Steven ?Steven again has been charged with hitting his teacher.
Steven needs services to help overcome his disabilities, not training so he
can parrot answers that will put him in a juvenile detention center. If
behavioral therapists had come to Steven's house once a week and to his
school once a week for a year, instead of receiving the Brown's School
instruction, there would have been a much better chance he, and his single
mom, would not be facing the current charges. The State has money for
competency training that hopes to permit the state to prosecute a
developmentally delayed third grader, but the schools do not have the money
for behavior therapists.
In October Drew, my 16 year old son with Asperger's Syndrome ( a
high-functioning autistic), was arrested on complaints by teachers in his
center school and taken to the Juvenile Detention Center. Often teachers
are not properly trained and can't get the support services they feel they
need.  The week before Drew's teacher filed charges, she was scheduled to
get long sought training.  That training that was canceled due to lack of
funds.  The teachers and staff are frustrated and strike out though the
criminal justice system.  She filed charges.
The system in the State of Florida is criminalizing many of those with
developmental disabilities in the year 2002. We had to have my son declared
incompetent.  In the behavior arena, the State is destroying the self
esteem the developmentally disabled and is demoralizing their parents.
Please look into The Brown School. See if the information I believe to be
correct really is. Please look into the lack of behavioral therapists and
the criminalization of those with developmental disabilities. My special
needs attorney promises me teachers are having developmentally disabled
students arrested all over the state.  And finally, let's amend the law
that says anytime a teacher is hit or kicked by a student, a felony has
been committed.  The very young and those with significant developmental
disabilities should be exempt.  You have to know that just in Polk County
alone over 20 "felonies" a day are being committed by elementary school
children with developmental disabilities when they kick or hit their
teachers.  Each teacher can chose to deny the student reentry to their
classroom and go through due process and/or the teacher can file criminal
charges.  More and more teachers are just filing criminal charges.
Steven's mom is a single parent and can't afford the special needs
attorney, the criminal attorney, and the expert witness I hired for my son
Drew. Steven has a pro bono attorney who is giving the matter a little
attention.  Most developmentally disabled kids and their families are
thrown out of the education system and into the criminal justice maelstrom
without a rudder.  What they need are trained staff and teachers and the
active involvement of behavior analysts.
Your help in doubling the developmentally disabled budget in the last three
years has been amazing.  Your help with Noah's Ark has been amazing.
Steven, his mom, Drew, my wife, myself, and kids all over the state need
yet another miracle.

Subject:	Osceola School District

Dear Govenor Bush,

It is my honor to write you concerning the proposed funding for rapidly
growing school districts.  It is imperitive the funding is approved for
Osceola County so we can keep pace with the rapidly growing population. 
As a high school algebra teacher it is of extreme important to have small
class sizes to provide the necessary instruction and one on one
interaction with algebra students. 

Should the funding not be approved, I personally face class sizes of
thirty plus, my colleages who teach Algebra II and Geometry face class
sizes of forty.  If I were a college professor, I say "bring it on!"  Yet
this is high school and we are dealing with children not adults.  Class
sizes of this size are detrimental to the education and success of our
future in Florida and the Nation.  It is bad enough that children come to
high school not prepared and we have to play catch up for a year.  To
support this more than 25% of the incomming 800 freshman read below the
third grade level.  By adding more students to the classes we will hurt
the education system further.

Govenor Bush, I implore you to approve the funding so we can add
classrooms, hire new teachers, and raise teacher salaries so as to provide
a quality education for our youth.  Yes I stated raise teachers salaries,
I could easily go to Orange or Seminol County and make more money, yet
Osceola is more personable and more supportive of its staff that is why I
choose to stay here.  Please approve the funds so we can do more for our
children.

Very Respectfully,

Leo S. Huott

Ps.  Jeb,  You have my vote in 2002!  I do not want to see the Democrats
in power and bring forth their programs that erode family values.

Dear Mr. Bush,

Thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule to read this e
mail.  I would like to introduce myself.  My name is Audie Confesor, and I
am a teacher in Osceola County.  The reason for my e mail is a request
that you do not veto the money that was approved by the State Legislature
to aid rapid growing counties.  I plan on finishing my career here in
Osceola County, and with your help, this county can flourish. Osecola
County has had the fastest growing school system in the state for the past
five years, and we may be the fastest growing for the next five years. 
Per capita, Osceola County has received the lowest amount for school
construction. There are some schools in this county that have thrity two
students per classroom. Many of the elementary instututions are old and
worn down. As an educator, I feel that smaller class size is beneficial to
the growth and development to your youth.  With the money, we can build
more schools, and attain the help that is necessary to help our students.  

Osceola County has exhausted all local sources for school construction by
levying two full mills, sharing in the local option sales tax, levying the
highest school impact fees in the state, and establishing seven charter
schools.  Osceola County also has one of the highest amount of charter
schools in the state.  In addition, Osceola County has used all effort
index dollars, as well as all classroom 1st dollars.  

In conclusion, I would like to say how much I do enjoy working for this
county.  I enjoy my career, and I treasure every minute of the time I
spend at my facility.  Please consider the State's decision to aid rapid
growing counties.  Thank you once again for your time and your
understanding.

Dear Mr. Bush sir,
	I urge you not to  veto the 10 million dollars that the state legislature
has approved for fast growing counties.  Osceola County has had the lowest
amount per capita for school construction in the past 4 or 5 years.
	Why do we need more school construction?  I am in the biggest elementary
school in this county (1100 students).  A new school is being built close
by and through redistricting we will be losing 300 students and 18
teachers and staff for the upcoming school year.  My dream for the
upcoming year was to have a "small first grade classroom" but already I
see I am "starting" the year with 25 children.  I had 25 students this
year also.  We have one teacher assistant per 8 teachers.
	Now, although I have been Teacher of the Year twice and District Teacher
of the Year once, I am also ESOL endorsed (with 7 Hispanic children this
yr. and will have 7 next year) and National Board Certified.......teaching
these children to read and write well is a very difficult task. Many of us
at Lakeview stay late and work and also come down on the weekends working
hard to make our academic lessons stimulating.  However, it continues to
be stressful and difficult to meet the needs of these ESOL students, low
students, gifted students and also the average students in our classrooms
when there are so many.   I don't need to tell you that the single most
important factor in a classroom is the quality of its teacher.  I have
been teaching for 28 years and I still love every single day in the
classroom but I do get frustrated when children coming into my classroom
come with some many home/ discipline/health related problems and I am
responsible for all of these areas as well as the academics.  I'm a good
teacher but I'm not "WonderWoman!" Please support the 10 million dollars
so class sizes will be reduced, I can continue to enjoy teaching and I can
prevent an early onset of gray hair!   Thank you for your time Mr. Bush.

Subject: Gandy Update


Gov:
 
Last night's public meeting revealed a new version of the elevated Gandy...instead of down the middle of Gandy FDOT shifted a Land Bridge over the north side of Gandy completely wiping out the 37 businesses affected...one wonders how all of a sudden this option appeared.  
 
However, the absence a Right of Way Cost really was a disservice to the commmunity.  I cannot understand after 12 years of study and millions of dollars, FDOT could not (or would not) have ROW Costs available.  In my opinion, this will be what finally decides the option that will be ultimately selected by FDOT.
 
Historically, an elevated Gandy was widely unacceptable to the community (except the south of Gandy folks who have opposed the By-pass all along) because of the devastation of the Gandy Business District and the unsightly ala Hwy 19 feel of this proposal.  I am unsure now, without ROW costs, of whether now an unsightly Land Bridge would be rejected because of it's reduced impact to the business district by taking 37 businesses which are primarily small businesses or parking lots.
 
FDOT did a better job of defining the on and offs of both facilities which seem to answer our concerns of getting folks on to Gandy that want to.  They also reaffirmed their commmitment to the $23 million Gandy improvements.  THe price tag of the Westshore truck ramps was put at $8-9 million if they do it.
 
Until the ROW costs are defined we will not know the direction FDOT is going. Or whether the No-build remains viable.
 
FDOT will be presenting to the South Tampa CHamber Board of Directors on June 6th at 6pm at the Jan Platt Library.  A first of them coming by a seeing us.
 
I will keep you all posted as I learn more and determine what the STCC feels about the project.
 
I would appreciate if you encourage FDOT to get the ROW costs to us and the public.
 
Hope all is well.

Please pass the Item on Page 416 of Section 28 on the Budget.  Osceola
County is in desperate need of assistance.

Even with the highest percentage of students in attendance at charter
schools in the entire state, public schools are extermely overcrowded.  We
have been given estimates of class sizes of a minimum of 30 students for
each class.  

We are the fastest growing county in the state and have been for five
years.  Projections show that our growth will continue for at least five
more years.  Most of the people moving here are not single, but people
with school age children.

Thank you for the help you've given Gateway High School students with
their Project Crosswalk, trying to make a safer crossing across eight
lanes of traffic that students cross daily.  We are still working on the
project and will continue to over the summer and probably into the fall.
Students are currently working with county engineers to persuade the State

along with the education of pedestrian safety the students already have
planned.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
As a concerned citizen and taxpayer I would like to express my support of the upcoming budget review for school funding in Osceola County.
 
Osceola County has had the fastest growing school system in the state for the past five years and is projected to have the fastest growing school system for the next five years.
 
- Osceola County has received the lowest amount, per capita, for school construction in the state for the past five years.
 
- Osceola County has one of the highest percentages of students in Charter Schools in the State.
 
- Osceola County is the only County in the state that has exhausted all local sources for school construction:
-         Levying a full 2 mills
-         Sharing in the Local Option Sales Tax
-         Levying the highest School Impact Fees in the State
-         Levying additional mills for a School Construction Bond Issue
-         Established seven charter schools
-         Using all effort index dollars
-         Using all classroom 1st dollars
 
Your approval of the 8.5 million dollars appropriated by the state legislature is vital to the future of our community and more importantly our children.
 
Please approve and sign the appropriation bill that can be found in the Budget in Section 28 on pate 416.

growth also comes growing pains, and we have them.  This explosion in
growth has created a great need for new facilities/schools.  The funds are
not there.  Osceola County is  the only County in the state that has
exhausted all local sources for school construction: Levying a full 2
mills, sharing in  the Local Option Sales Tax, Levying the highest School
Impact Fees in the State, levying additional mills for a School
Construction Bond Issue, Established seven charter schools, using all
effort index dollars, and using all classroom 1st dollars.  Amazing!!!
Respectfully, I am requesting that you support the approval of $10 million
to help fast growing counties.  I believe Osceola County would benefit
from these needed funds.  Believe me, the funds will be well expended to
help the children of Osceola County.

Thank You,

I just had a chance to review the latest visitation figures through last
night. I  want to say how much
the Governor,Secretary and I  appreciate the tremendous effort our staff is
making to visit all their
kids for the month of May by today. We are not there yet but we are getting
very close. I honestly believe
there is NO state in the country at this time which can say they have a
better awareness of where kids
under their supervision are than Florida. Of course no-one would ever print
that because it doesn't make
good news.I would hope that you would share our sincere thanks with all
staff.

I also know staff understand the on-going importance of this effort, and
that we will continue our goal
of visiting all of our kids every 30days! What we will TRY to do is to ease
some of the other burdens
that often get in the way of counselors and supervisors performing their
most important function, ensuring
the safety of kids! The Governor and the Secretary are very aware the vast
majortity of our staff do one
heck of a job!

Please support and sign for the line item for Osceola County found in the
proposed Budget in Section 28 on page 416.  

In order to provide a world-class education and to improve student
achievement for all Osceola County school children, we truly need your
support.  With our high population growth, we have exhausted all other

child behind.  Our Osceola County students will become future citizens of
Florida, and they will rely upon their education to build the economy and
quality of life for all Floridians.

I submit the following information for your consideration in your
decision.  

1.  Osceola County has had the fastest growing school system in the state
for the past five years, and is projected to have the fastest growing
school system for the next five years.

2.  Osceola County has received the lowest amount, per capita, for school
construction in the state for the past five years.

3.  Osceola County has one of the highest percentages of students in
charter schools in the State.

4.  Osceola County is the only County in the state that has exhausted all
local sources for school construction:
	- Levying a full 2 mills,
	- Sharing in the Local Option Sales Tax,
	- Levying the highest School Impact Fees in the State,
	- Levying additional mills for a School Construction Bond Issue,

Water district scrutinizes $1.9 million contract with former partner of
Gov.
Bush

By David Fleshler 
Staff Writer 
Posted May 23 2002 
Investigations into the company have become a potential source of
embarrassment for Bush as he campaigns for a second term. Last month,
the
U.S. Department of Justice filed suit against the company over the
alleged
misuse of a U.S.-backed loan to sell equipment to Nigeria. Bush, who was
not
accused of wrongdoing, had traveled to Nigeria in 1989 as a
representative
of a company he owned jointly with MWI's president, David Eller, to sell
irrigation and flood control equipment.  The water management district
investigation concerns a contract the district awarded Sept. 25, 2000,
as
the region entered the third year of a drought. As the water level of
Lake
Okeechobee fell, the district desperately needed submersible pumps to
siphon
up water that would not flow out on its own by gravity. The water was
needed
for farms, wells and to prevent saltwater from intruding into the
groundwater that serves cities.  To build the pumps, the district turned
to
MWI, which had supplied equipment to the district since 1965. Eller, the
company's president, is a second-generation member of the family-run
firm.
He is also a generous Republican contributor. He and his company have
given
$18,490 in political contributions in Florida since 1996, nearly all of
it
to Republicans, according to state campaign finance records. He also has
personally contributed $21,100 to federal candidates and political
organizations, including $15,900 to the Republican Party, according to
the
Federal Election Commission.  The district's nine-member board is
appointed
by the governor. At the time the contract was awarded, most members were
Bush appointees. Phone calls to Bush's media relations office were not
returned Wednesday.  Because the pumps were needed immediately to deal
with
the drought, the board waived its normal procurement rules and allowed
its
staff to award the contract. A total of 15 pumps were installed along
the
lake's southern rim. The pumps worked well, allowing the district to
draw in
water that would have otherwise been out of reach.  But the district's
inspector general has launched a complaint about the circumstances under
which the contract was awarded.  "The inquiry is into the propriety of
the
district's actions in procuring pumps," said Smith, the district's
spokesman.  He said that MWI is a well-known company, with a good
record.
And it could offer a fast turn-around time for orders that needed to be
filled immediately, a crucial point with a drought on.  But he
acknowledged
that the district's staff had contacted MWI and worked with the company
to
develop specifications before other companies were allowed to bid. He
said
such contacts are not unusual, when staffers need to know whether a
project
is doable or not. And he acknowledged that staffers drafted a memo
awarding
the contract to MWI before making a last-minute decision to solicit bids
from other companies.  Michael Collins, a Bush appointee who was
chairman of
the district's board at the time, said he thinks the district's staff is
too
close to many contractors, appearing to favor certain ones over others.
But
he said there's no hint that the governor exerted any influence on
behalf of
his former partner.  "That's total garbage," he said. "We don't play
those
games. I have never gotten a call from anyone in the governor's office
about
doing a favor. Am I concerned over the procurement process and over
staff
doing a favor? We're looking into it. We have been extremely upset, as a
board, over staff bringing the same companies back again and again."
MWI
spokesman Kevin Boyd said the company did nothing wrong in obtaining the
contract. Other companies were offered the chance to bid on the pump
deal,
and several did, he said.  "MWI operates on a level playing field with
the
competition," he said. "Water management district contracts are not that
easy to come by, and you have to do your homework. They've done plenty
of
work under Chiles and other Democratic governors. It's not like when a
Republican came in they suddenly got business."  In the Nigeria deal, he
said the company did nothing wrong. The federal government's suit
accuses
the company of misusing a $74.3 million loan through the Export-Import
Bank
of the United States. The lawsuit says the company gave one-third of the
loan money to a Nigerian representative who used it to make payoffs to
Nigerian officials.  Boyd said the federal government has dropped a
criminal
investigation into the Nigeria allegations and that he expected the same
result for the civil suit.  David Fleshler can be reached at

Dear Gov. Bush,

You have an opportunity to help Osceola County schools by allowing critical
funding designed to aid fast-growing counties.  The budget you are
considering includes $8.5 million which would be of great assistance in
helping Osceola "catch up" with the burgeoning demand for schools.

I offer the following facts for your consideration:

- Osceola County has had the fastest growing school system in the state for
the past five years and is projected to have the fastest growing school
system for the next five years.
- Osceola County has received the lowest amount, per capita, for school
construction in the state for the past five years.
- Osceola County has one of the highest percentages of students in Charter
Schools in the State.
- Osceola County is the only County in the state that has exhausted all
local sources for school construction: - Levying a full 2 mills - Sharing in
the Local Option Sales Tax - Levying the highest School Impact Fees in the
State - Levying additional mills for a School Construction Bond Issue -
Established seven charter schools - Using all effort index dollars - Using
all classroom 1st dollars
- The appropriation can be found in the Budget in Section 28 on page 416.

I urge you to leave this much needed funding in the budget.  Thank you.

Governor Bush:
As a long time supporter (I still have the bumper sticker on from the last

Candidate for County Commissioner District 2 here is Osceola County, I
request that you sign the Bill that will support the funding of schools for
fast growing counties in our state (which may be found in the Budget in
Section 28 on page 416).

Osceola County has had the fastest growing school system in the state for
over five years, but as you probably know, we received the lowest amount,
per capita, for new school construction for the past five years.  We have
made the maximum local effort to resolve this issue LOCALLY.  We have one of
the highest percentages of students in Charter Schools in the State.  We are
the ONLY County in the state that has exhausted ALL local sources for school
construction by levying the full 2 mills, procuring a share of our Local
Option Sales Tax, levying the highest School Impact Fees in the State and
additional mills for a School Construction Bond Issue, using all effort
index dollars and all classroom 1st dollars.  We are simply out of options
and truly need these additional dollars.

I would appreciate your support in this manner.

In fact, Osceola County has one of the highest percentages of students in charter schools in the state.

Subject:	Education Funds for Fast Growing Counties

As a Principal of a middle school in Osceola County, I urge you to
maintain the additional $10 million funding for fast growing counties that
is in the budget in Section 28 on page 416.  Osceola County has been the
fastest growing school system in the state for the past five years, but
has received the lowest amount, per capita, for school construction.
Obviously, we are in a serious bind and desperately need the additional
$8.5 million funding targeted for Osceola County.  Our school board is
doing everything possible to provide schools for our ever-growing student
population.  They have actively encouraged charter schools, and we have
the highest percentage of students in charter schools in the state. 
Osceola County is the only County in the state that has exhausted all
local sources for school construction by levying a full 2 mills, sharing
in the local opion sales tax, levying the highest school impast fees in
the state, levying additional mills for a school construction bond issue,
esablishing seven charter schools, using all effort index dollars, and
using all classroom 1st dollars.  Obviously, Osceola County needs help in
meeting the school building needs of a fast-growing population.  Please
maintain the funds presently in the budget and do not veto this item.  We
need those critical funds.

Subject:	Funding For Fast Growing Counties!

I would appreciate you approving the funding for Osceola
County schools.  I have worked in this county for over twenty years, and I
have seen the growth.  Some of our schools are very crowded now;we have
run out of space for staff and students.
Thank you very much.

Subject:	$$$ for Osceola

Dear Governor Bush, 
I have been an employee for the Osceola County School Board for 13 years.
During my employment I have seen incredible change in our county. The most
significant being the change in size. As a result of the increase in our
population I have also seen an increase in class size. I worked at a
school that had 32-35 students in each fourth grade class. This is
ridiculous - especially with the recent legislation regarding students
reading on grade level by third grade. 
We will have 2 new elementary schools for the coming school year but still
our schools are overcrowed. I was pleased to read about the $8.5 million
that Osceola was to receive for new schools. That's great but we still
will not be able to keep pace with the growth we are experiencing. 
Now I have been told that you may veto the allocation of these funds. I
ask that you think carefully about this decision, as I am sure you will.
Osceola County needs more classrooms so that we may better serve our
students. Come visit us. I think you will be impressed with what you will
see in our crowded classrooms. Imagine what you might see if the classes
were smaller and the students had more individual teacher contact time. 
Thank you for your time!

Subject:	FCAT  Results

When my wife and I and our four sons moved to the Orando area from Jacksonville, our main goal was to move into the Winter Park High School district and it's feeder schools. We therefore moved to Maitland so our sons could attend Dommerich Elementary, Maitland Middle School and Winter Park High School. We have since learned that a lot of other parent's have done likewise including your columnist Mike Thomas.
When we recently saw the FCAT results, we realized what a good decision we had made. The scores at these schools stood out like a sore thumb. When you see that a school like Dommerich scores 84% on the third grade reading section, it makes one wonder why? We know why. First, this is a community with parents that care. Most of these students come from two parent families who really care about their children's education. It is an above average income area with a lot of parents with college educations and many professional people.These parents take the time to sit down and read to their children and also listen to the child read to them.They know their children's  teachers and take part in parent-teacher activities. This school is blessed with children from a wholesome back ground.
There are those among us that think that raising taxes and throwing money at education solves all educational problems. Money can build buildings, but it won't get parents involved in educating their children. They think that educating their children is a government function and they can't be bothered in helping.
Mike Thomas and the liberal Democrats including the leadership of the teachers unions blame Jeb Bush. The Republicans blame Lawton Chiles and the Democrats because they controlled education in Florida for many years. The last three or four teachers of the year are supporting Jeb Bush in his re-election campaign as witnessed by his TV commercials..
Ladies and gentlemen, education is the biggest political football  there is. There are many children who don't come from a home background like I have described. Some have one parent, some live with a grandparent, some can't even speak the English language. How can any one expect them to read?
Why don't all of these people who are complaining about our schools go to a school that didn't have the scores that Dommerich had and volunteer to mentor an unfortunate child? The blessings I can assure you will be many. In spite of all the criticism our governor gets, he is doing just that. If you think he is doing it for political reasons so be it. The bottom line however is that he is doing it.

>  
> Prior to the revisions set to go into effect, the INS and U.S. Customs had
> elevated its security as a result of the tragic events of September 11.

   The Bill CS/SB 160, otherwise known as the "Debbie Wasserman-Schultz Act", 
would help fund the volunteer operated greyhound adoption program.
   This bill would further provide changes to the number of days and hours of 
operation of the cardroom as well as replacing the ten-dollar "pot limit"

Hello Sirs, 

I am SFC Heath Nierman from Ft Lauderdale, FL.  I have been on active duty for twelve years and am currently stationed at FORT BENNING, GA B CO 2/29th IN.  I have been trying for the past year to turn in an Officer Candidate Selection Packet for review in order to become a commissioned officer.  The only thing I have wanted to do in my life since I was a child is be in the ARMY I am here and love it.  I have set many goals along my career and am proud to say I have achieved them. Several years ago my wife who is also active duty mentioned to me becoming an officer, a friend of hers was going to OCS and when I thought it through I decided that I would like to do that as the next step in my career. I set out to get the required college hours by reenlisting for the college option.  I never dreamed I would encounter what I have.  Attached is an outline of the situations that I have tried to overcoming in my attempts to submit this packet.  Today I was denied the opportunity to go to the post Inspector General's Office to voice my concerns off possibly being "black balled" by my chain of command.  This reality hit me hard as I have always fully trusted in my chain of command to take care of me as a soldier like I take care of those soldiers that serve under me.  I feel now like it is becoming a hostile working environment for me there as they attempt to brand me for stirring up trouble in an attempt to submit my OCS packet.  This will be damaging if not detrimental to my career.  I also fear repercussions for further pursuing submission of my packet but I know that I must set an example for those under me that if they have a goal they should do what is right to pursue that goal and not allow it to hampered by the invalid attempts of others. If there is anything you can do to aid me in submitting this packet I respectfully ask for your help.  If you would like to speak with me concerning this please call me at :  334-448-4134 (home), 706-545-6459 (work), or 706-570-4796 (cell).

Tony and Pam,

At our May 17 meeting you (Tony) asked me to write up a brief evaluation of
the proposed constitutional amendment to review sales tax exemptions, and
I've attached a first draft as a Microsoft Word document.

Pam, I'm sending it to you too, first because I'd appreciate any comments,
and second, I want to make sure the facts are correct.  I looked on
MyFlorida.com to try to find the wording of the proposed amendment, but
could not find it.  Can you point me to the actual wording, so I might
check what I said against what the legislature actually passed?

After I have a chance to review this, I'll do another draft.  Please
suggest any arguments I might have missed, or any changes you think would
be appropriate.  Tony, I'd be happy to make this a statement of the whole
CEA if you want to do that, or my personal statement which might appear on

Dear members and friends, 
 
Two recent HOA stories are of particular interest. The latest is about foreclosures in CA. The other is about how a Florida community is attempting to achieve its goal of complaince.  
 
These are excerpts from the CA foreclosure story. Please note the stance of CAI,  (A RED ALERT?)
 
Associations sometimes show teeth 

Homeowners fight foreclosures by their community associations 


By Jessica Brice, The Associated Press
May 24, 2002 


SACRAMENTO -- Ellen D'Agostino nearly lost her home over $250 in back dues she owed to her homeowners association. 


Having her association foreclose on her home was not something she signed on for when she moved into Creekside Circle, a gated community in Sacramento, D'Agostino says. 


But representatives for the Creekside Circle Homeowners Association maintain that's exactly what she did. Spelled out in the contract D'Agostino signed when she bought her home was an agreement giving the association the right to foreclose to obtain back dues. 


More than 19 million homes and one out of every six Americans belong to a homeowners association within a common interest development, according to the Community Associations Institute in Alexandria, Va. 

The institute is one of the largest opponents of a California bill that seeks to give homeowners more time when faced with association foreclosure.

Governor, I checked with the prison. Since Mr. Oliveros will not be eligible
for release until 2007, they will not allow a furlough for his son's
graduation.  If he had a terminally ill family member, they might be able to
make an exception, but this is not the case.  The federal system  allows 5
day furloughs for inmates with 12 months or less remaining on their
sentence.  As such, Mr. Oliveros does not qualify.  I called Mrs. Krutulis
and let her know. I also provided her with the phone number and name of the
Associate Warden at the prison.  Warden Stevens indicated she would be happy
to explain the policy to Mrs. Krutulis.  Wendy

Anyway, here are the two main things I wanted to give you an update on:
1.  We should know by Tuesday or Wednesday about the federal reading money.  The reviewers were discussing our application yesterday and today in DC, and I was promised a phone call by Wednesday.  
 
2.  The reading endorsement certification rule will be on the last state board agenda in June.  We had about 50 public responses to the draft rule, and all were positive.

Hello Governor Bush

   I sure hope that you do not ever get tired of hearing from me. I felt the 
email attachment as many others is very important. This pre-adoptive parent 
has had Temeka since Dec 2001 and has received no foster care or as the 
parent states they have not received any financial help from anyone, not 
even one cent. This child is in a foster care status at this time. Could the 
agency be holding up funds because the family has made a special needs 
subsidy request? That certainly wouldn't be fair to the child, if this is 
the case or not. It appears to me, that the state is making exceptions all 
over regarding adoption subsidies depending on the county the child resides 
in. Some counties are giving a little extra yet other counties are saying 
there is no funding to give a special rate. It appears that Florida's 
children are suffering from lack of funds and services. I get a great number 
of emails from people who have adopted Florida's special needs children 
without any subsidy/medicaid at all. These families contact me at a later 
date once they have found out their child was entitled to an adoption 
subsidy. I thought that is what the Federal Subsidy Program was designed 
for. I have been asking questions regarding the subsidy, medicaid and large 
foster care rates that adoptive parents have had to pay but other than Carol 
answering some of my questions no one is giving me answers I need. If you 
can help I would greatly appreciate it as I am unsure how to respond to 
adoptive/foster parents at times. Also if you ever come our way again, I 
would love to meet with you to express my gratitude on the adoption issues, 
as well a the medical school (it was fianlly closed down) and also I would 
like to become more educated on the adoption issues in the state of Florida. 
Please read the attached. Donna NACAC Rep

Great things are happening with the 2002 Gulf Coast Technology Summit
and Exposition.  Check the latest update on our website at
www.ITGulfCoast.Com .

Dave Perry and I just returned from similar trade shows in Atlanta and
Orlando.
We will be implementing many of the ideas that we saw at those shows so
we have a very smooth registration process for sponsors, exhibitors, seminar
speakers and attendees.  In addition, we picked up at least 12 very sold
national
and regional prospects that may be coming to participate in our event in
Pensacola.

GCTSE exhibit space should be 80-90% sold out by the end of June.  We hope
you are planning on participating.

Please call me at 850-439-9101 if you have any questions.

Have a great Memorial Day weekend!

I was of the understanding that you were planning to veto the Legislature
budget.  Or perhaps I used the wrong word, after all it is the end of the
school year for us and I was not thinking among the many things that I
have to do! (:  Instead of reconsider, I think that i better say:  Please
do not veto The State Legislature approved $10 million to help fast
growing counties

And thank you so much for replying! glad to know you are in touch with
Floridians!

I will look into this. If the item went through the proper review and it was not funded with monies that go to exisiting programs it will be funded. If it didn't do either of those two things, then it probably won't.  Thanks, Mike.

Jeb,  As you are reviewing the budget, I would ask that you favorably consider line item2077 which calls for $250,000 for a Planning, Development and Environmental Study to replace our North Bridge to N Hutchinson Island. This would be the start of a long term process to replace our existing draw bridge. St Lucie Counties MPO supports the replacement of the bridge.  Thank you for your consideration.

thank you Sally. I don't believe increased taxes should be the first resort but the last. This year, we increased the school budget by 9% in a tough economic period. I know it is never enough but that increase is the highest in a long while.

Subject: Why not?


Dear Jeb-
	Since McBride brought up the idea of using a tax on cigarettes to
better fund education, I'd like to add the idea of taxing liquor and
alcoholic beverages 50 cents more, too.  I know you were against more
taxes, but you also said you are for education.  These two products often
have a negative effect on our innocent children.  As teachers we encounter
these effects often, and have an even more difficult job educating children
whose lives are disrupted by alcohol abuse, or who suffer from
alcohol-fetal syndrome and have learning disabilities.  We have had a huge
increase in asthmatic children who miss many days of school and often do
not have the money or resources to get the medical care they need.  Often
the asthma is related to the smoking in their household.
	My class size increased last year, from 14 to 21.  They said next
year it may go up again.  Why are we shortchanging our future generation?
If you really want to see us improve what we are doing, we need a higher
ratio of adults to students.  We need after school tutoring that doesn't
depend on grant funding or the generosity of more donated "teacher time".
We are striving mightily to improve-there is so much to be done!!  We work
untold numbers of unpaid hours documenting children's needs, doing
fund-raisers, conferencing with parents and doing home visits, planning and
learning new strategies, attending school sponsored events after hours and
on weekends.  We need facilities improved and portables removed in many
schools.  Please give these taxes a second thought and think of them as an
investment in our future.
	Yours truly,
	Sally Feehrer

Dear Governor Bush--
 
As a Virginian, I no longer have the honor of having a Republican Governor, but thanks the FreeRepublic.com, I do get to read a lot about your accomplishments as the Governor of Florida.  Amongst your efforts, I find most impressive is your support of Home-Schoolers and School Vouchers, both of which promise to dramatically improve our education system in the not-so-distant future.  Below is a typical thread lauding your administration's efforts in this area 
 
http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/687902/posts
 
However, I'd also like to take this opportunity to urge you to urge your brother, the President, to Stay the Course in the War Against Terrorism!!  Recent efforts to dissuade Israel from dealing with the PLO and hints that we are no longer going to take out Saddam Hussein tend to make me believe Dubyuh is getting some bum advice from his advisors.  Please let him know that patriotic Americans are ready to follow his lead if he remains committed to ridding this World of Terrorist Regimes.
 
Good Luck Against the Butcher of Waco and Enslaver of Elian, Butch Reno, in the upcoming election...Steve

You have vetoed this appropriations for the last 3 years and I shall appreciate your assistance again this year. This is line item 527 at the top of page 100. As a member of the Florida Partnership for School Readiness, the board recommends a comprehensive vision examination, not this screening prior to entry of school.

I would have never made it through High School if it was not for the help and support from the Governor of Florida. When I realized that I had made a bad decision with dropping out of High School and moving out on my own. With working forty hours getting no where in my life living pay check to pay check. I knew at that time in my life that I needed to go back to school to get my education. I had contacted the Governor by e-mail explaining my situation. Within twenty four hours I had been contacted by the head of Pinellas county schools and I had a follow up letter from the Governor. He sent me emails through out the year asking how I was doing and encouraging me to further my education.

 If it was not for the inspiration I received from Governor Jeb Bush. I would not be where I am today.

Subject: Michelle T. Bolin #P05007


Governor Bush has asked that I respond to your letter regarding your
daughter, Michelle T. Bolin.  

The following information is provided addressing each of the concerns
raised
regarding the care of your daughter, 
Michelle
Bolin.

1.	There was a problem once with her catheter wherein the bag was
not
completely clamped off.  This was rectified immediately.  The nurse that
consistently takes care of Inmate Bolin says that she has never once
laid in
urine and if there were any problem with the catheter, she would have it
rectified immediately.

2.	Inmate Bolin's dressings are changed twice daily by staff that
are
extremely conscientious regarding the use of universal precautions due
to
the high number of patients with communicable diseases.  We have found
no
evidence of packing being left in her wounds.  The lack of infection in
the
wounds is evidence that the dressings are being changed properly.  

3.	An appointment was made to evaluate her for possible surgical
repair
of the ulcer, however, it was decided that it required healing from the
inside out due to the size of the ulcer.  These ulcers develop because
of
the pressure caused by sitting or lying.  She has been instructed to
move
frequently from side to side and to avoid sitting for extended periods
of
time.  Inmate Bolin has been offered an overlay mattress and inflatable
wheelchair cushions to assist in the prevention of these ulcers.  Inmate
Bolin has good upper body strength and can move with minimal assistance,
however, she refuses to change position often for hours at a time and
has
refused the use of the overlay mattress.  The staff have made repeated
attempts to establish patient compliance with this issue to no avail.

While at NFRC, she was also evaluated for repair of an alleged bone
infection, but it was determined there was none to be repaired.
Therefore
the surgery was cancelled.  However, she is in no way about to "die from
lack of care".  The referenced "hole in the intestines" is due to the
colostomy site.

4.	Appointments with the doctors have been made regularly through
the
course of the year with the first appointment being scheduled on
February
20, 2002.  A follow-up appointment was scheduled for a month later,
however,
Michelle refused to attend.  Her appointment was rescheduled for two
weeks
later but had to be moved to a later date as the doctor was not in the
clinic that day.  The April 10, 2002 appointment was kept while she was
in
the hospital.

5.	Inmate Bolin's wheelchair was left at Lowell CI to be repaired,
which has occurred.  In the interim, she has been provided with a ROHO
cushion, which is air inflated to prevent pressure sores.  We have no
indication that a grievance had to be filed to initiate the repairs.

6.	The DOC does has 5 female facilities in Florida.  The only
female
institution in North Florida is Gadsden C.I., and it is not rated for
her
medical needs.  Lowell CI is rated for her security level and medical
needs
and has been determined by our Classification Office to be the most
suitable
location for her at this time.  In addition, due to her disciplinary
history, she is not eligible to request a transfer closer to home.  

The Department has taken great care to address Inmate Bolin's medical
needs.
Her transfer to NFRC, the department's medical facility, is evidence of
that.  She is very much in control of her faculties and must take an
active
role in her personal care.  At times, she has chosen not to comply with
the
medical instructions given her, however, we can not force an inmate to
comply with the doctors directions.    

Please let me know if you need further information.

thousands of children that will be affected by the transfer of approximately
$18.5 million from the Department of Children and Families, Alcohol, Drug,

children in our state are allowed to "fall through the cracks" of the
"system."  Please do not allow this to happen to the children being serviced
by these programs.  Stop the transfer of monies from the PRTS to Medicaid.

Subject:	Just Sayin' Hi and Thank you!

Dear Jeb:

I would guess that as a political figure, you get a lot of friendly emails requesting things from you.

This is not one of them.

I hope it means it's not destined for the trash can without reading but no, I have no real requests, and if I did, I'd generally keep it to myself because that's how I am.  I don't normally write to politicians (after the boilerplate form letters from Jim Davis the congresscritter (yes, I am a Freeper, no secret there), I don't bother.) but I felt that you are a special case and worthy of both support and praise.

But I have been a resident of this State for 12 years now.  I came in 1990 to get away from the abysmal political situation in Los Angeles to start a new life somewhere where laws made at least a little sense.  When people nit pick about this and that, I have learned to simply smile and enjoy the fact that they CAN nit pick about the little things, instead of "enjoying" a crime-ridden, corruption-ridden police state that the People's Republik of Kalifornia has become.

I was afraid of it happening here with Br'er Lawton at the wheel.  I'm sorry he died, but I never knew him personally and I think his politics sucked.

I want to thank you for fighting the good fight.  For standing up and taking it in the chops every time someone gets pissed off at what you do.  I do not envy you in the least, because I only have a minor inkling of the "damned if you do, damned if you don't" situation you must deal with every day.  And to have no time to yourself to be a human being (with cameras on you all the time, you can't even pick your nose without someone watching...how embarrassing!) that, I imagine can get pretty damn stressful.  I know it would drive me nuts.

So when you're having one of those frequent "Sucks to be me" days, I want you to remember that at least one little constituent in Tampa is not just rootin' for ya, but really does appreciate what you have done, and what you are trying to do.  I know that no matter how much good you do for education, someone will blame you.  No matter how hard you try to right the wrongs and injustices of government, someone will squall that they were cheated.  I know we can't win the societal pissing contest that politics is.  But someone has to stand up for the people and be our representative, our voice.  Not some self-appointed media talking head who thinks he knows best, but a man whom the population has ELECTED, for whatever reason (I know some pretty stupid reasons for voting for people...don't ask how), to be their voice.  You are our elected voice, and I think you're doing pretty darn good.  Not that my opinion matters a heck of a lot.  I don't make big claims to anybody.  I don't have lots of money to donate to causes.  I just live here.

Thank you, Jeb.  I'm glad you're my Governor.

Very Truly Yours,

Dear Gov. Bush, "The Education Governor"
 
Please support fast growing Counties- Orange and Osceola really need the
funds to keep pace with growth.  I, for one, would have a hard time
supporting your re-election if you veto the 8.5 million that is to go to
Osceola County.

RE: ADAM GRATE MEDIATION IN POLK COUNTY

MR. STETLER,

   WHEN WE FIRST SPOKE ON THE PHONE YOU ASSURED ME THAT A MEDIATION MEETING 
COULD BE HELD AT A NEUTRAL SITE, A LIBRARY WAS AN EXAMPLE, AS I TOLD YOU 
THAT THE SCHOOL BOARD ON FLORAL AVE. IS "ENEMY TERRITORY". SO A NEW 
LOCATION, POSSIBLE THE MULBERRY LIBRARY, WILL NEED TO BE FOUND.  ALSO, ADAM 
MAY WELL BE IN THE HOSPITAL THIS WEEK FOR THE SURGERY TO REMOVE AND BIOPSY 
THE TUMOR IN HIS FACE. A MAY 31ST MEETING WILL HAVE TO BE RESCHEDULED TO THE 
FIRST FRIDAY THE SCHOOL DISTRICT CAN ATTEND. I AM SORRY FOR ANY 
INCONVENIENCE ADAMS CONDITION MAY CAUSE.

    ALSO, AS FAR AS WHO IS TO COME.  PAT BARNES, PRINCIPAL OF MULBERRY 
MIDDLE SCHOOL (MMS) DOES NOT NEED TO ATTEND AS ADAM WILL UNDER NO 
CIRCUMSTANCES ATTEND MULBERRY MIDDLE SCHOOL JUST FOR ONE OF MANY 
REASONS........ IT IS DETRIMENTAL TO HIS HEALTH. IF THE DISTRICT INSISTS SHE 
ATTEND THEN THE PRINCIPAL OF LAKELAND HIGHLANDS MIDDLE SCHOOL (LHMS), JOEL 
WHIDDON, MUST BE PRESENT TO TESTIFY TO THE LAYOUT OF LHMS.

   I WENT TO LHMS AND HAD NO OPPOSITION WHATSOEVER WHEN I TOOK PICTURES OF 
THE CLINIC. WHEN I WENT TO MMS (THE SCHOOL YEAR WAS OVER FOR STUDENTS BUT 
SCHOOL PERSONNEL WERE ON CAMPUS AND IT WAS OPEN AND KIDS WERE PLAYING ON THE 
GROUNDS) AND WAS TRYING TO TAKE PICTURES OF THE CLINIC AREA AND BATHROOM TO 
BRING TO THE MEDIATION MEETING FOR COMPARISON OF CAMPUS' FOR LRE, PAT 
BARNES, SAID I COULD NOT TAKE THE PICTURES I NEED. WHEN I WENT OUTSIDE TO 
TAKE PICTURES OF THE DISTANCE FROM THE MAIN CAMPUS OUT TO THE WING WHERE 
CHORUS IS HELD, PAT BARNES CAME OUT AND SAID I COULD NOT TAKE ANY PICTURES.  
I HAD ALREADY TAKEN CAMPUS PICTURES TO DEPICT THE OUTSIDE CAMPUS OF MMS VS 
INSIDE CAMPUS OF LHMS.  I NEED FOR YOU TO CONTACT SHERWIN HOLMES FOR HIM TO 
CONTACT MRS. BARNES TO STOP HER ABSURD DEFENSIVE BEHAVIOR.  I SEE NO 
REASONABLE REASON THAT VIDEO/PICTURES TO DEPICT THE DIFFERENCES IN CAMPUS' 
SHOULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO THE MEETING. PICTURES COULD ONLY MAKE THE MATTER 
MORE CLEAR FOR THE MEDIATOR. I ASSUME THAT THAT IS WHY MRS. BARNES OBJECTS 
BUT SHE MUST BE FAIR AND THINK OF WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE 
STUDENT AND NOT FUNDING ISSUES.

   I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION THEN I WILL CLOSE.  WILL PARTICIPANTS OF THIS 
MEETING ALL BE TOGETHER TO TALK ALL AT ONE TIME, OR CAN WE HAVE INDIVIDUAL 
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN MYSELF, THE MEDIATOR, AND ONE PERSON AT A TIME?

    THANKS FOR YOUR TIME AND HELP. I AM SO GLAD THAT PEOPLE LIKE YOU DO THIS 
TYPE OF INTERPLAY. IS IT NOT SORRY THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS, STUDENTS, AND 
PARENTS NEED PEOPLE LIKE YOU TO DO THIS WORK?  IT IS SUCH A SHAME THAT ADAM 
MISSED A WHOLE SCHOOL YEAR BECAUSE I WAS TOLD THAT ADAM MUST BE ENROLLED IN 
A SCHOOL TO GET THIS MEDIATION AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL MARCH THAT SOMEONE ELSE 
IN THE DOE INFORMED ME THAT THAT WAS NOT THE CASE.  WE COULD HAVE DONE THIS 
MEDIATION BACK IN SEPT.2001 AND ADAM WOULD NOT BE IN A POSITION THAT HE MAY 
HAVE TO DO 6TH GRADE FOR THE THIRD YEAR. BUT THEN AGAIN, FROM OCT. 2001 
UNTIL FEB.2002, I HAD BEEN TOLD BY MR. RAY ELLIOTT THAT HE WAS SETTING UP AN 
"ARBITRATION" MEETING. IT WAS NOT UNTIL FEB. 26, 2002 THAT I WAS TOLD THAT 
THE SCHOOL DISTRICT HAD DECIDED NOT TO HAVE AN "ARBITRATION" MEETING MONTHS 
BEFORE. THAT WAS THE DAY THAT JOE ADAMS, THE SUPERVISOR FOR POLK COUNTY 
SCHOOL DISTRICT STUDENT SERVICES AND THE SUPERVISOR OF RAY ELLIOTT, TOLD ME 
IN DUSTY PAYNES, THE ASST. SUPERINTENDENT OF POLK COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT, 
"CYNDI, YOU HAVE BUT ONE OPTION AND THAT IS TO HAVE ADAM ENROLLED BACK AT 
MMS, AND MMS IS YOUR ONLY OPTION OF SCHOOLS, OR TOMORROW WE WILL FILE 
PAPERWORK TO PROSECUTE YOU". TRUST ME THAT IF I DID NOT FEAR THE LOSS OF MY 
SOLE INCOME TO SUPPORT MY SONS, GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE, I WOULD HAVE LET THIS 
GO COURT AND OUT TO THE PUBLIC.  ALL THIS AND WE COULD HAVE HAD MEDIATION 
BACK IN SEPT. 2001.

   LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU.

Ideally, we could do the test and get it back quickly. In order to do so, we would have to eliminate the writing portions of the test which the experts say would be horrible. We can't return the scores so late since it would eliminate the chance to remediate any problems.

Hi, Jeb:

I have a suggestion that I would like you to seriously
think about.  The FCAT is given too early.  The kids
now have the idea that once they've taken the test,
school ends for the year.  I have spoke to a lot of
educators about this and they feel the same way.

Suggestion:  Give the FCAT the end of May (perhaps the
3rd week in May).  Scores will be sent to schools the
middle of August.  Students will find out their grade
placement only a week or two before school begins. 
Schools will receive their grades the latter part of
August.  We really have to do something about this.

Thanks for listening and enjoy your weekend.  -Art

Dear Governor Bush; 
I believe you are wrong by asking Hollis Batchelor of SAG to review the
state talent agency regulations and should consider an actor like myself
as he is only a employee of the Guild.  You need this information from
someone who is out there seeking employment as a union member , not a
figure head, and a reliable fully paid up member of the SAG as well as
Equity. 
Burt Richards
Memeber of both in good standing.

This is what I have done for my friends and members. Read On;
From Actors Equity Association 

Dear Burt,
I received a message from Executive Director Alan Eisenberg from Italy
where
he is on a two week trip.  He did mention that because of your urgings he
spoke to the Tony Administration Committee about honoring Julie Harris. 
I
was totally unaware of Mr. Eisenberg's involvement until yesterday.  He
will
return to New York in 8 days and will most probably be in touch with you
after that time.
You should be proud of your participation in this Lifetime Achievement

And......my thanks for paying your dues.

Subject: Re: Talent agent complaint


Dear Mr. Becker, 

Sir, 
your reply only serves to show me how incomplete your investigations are and,
how incompetent your agency really is.
After you read my reply to your latest letter you will know why we don't trust the DPR! 

My letter to Jeb stated that we feel that your agency the DPR is trying to completely white wash this issue and that it would soon be exposed by the national media.

Additionally,
I truly believe that the Governor should stop forwarding my letters back to the DPR for a reply 
and take some immediate action in this matter.

Here's why,
for the record over the past year and a half  42 victims plus have come forward having filed complaints with the Tampa Police Department the DPR, Hillsborough consumer protection agency and with the (AG) Attorney Generals offices.
Each passing day this list of victims only grows longer.

Fact 1
Both the (AG) and the consumer protection agency have referred all of them back to the DPR because of the jurisdiction issues that I referenced in my first letter. 
.

Fact 2 
The DPR has known about these scams for over two years and it has failed to take any action what so ever
to protect the consumers or Florida citizens / tax payers from this fraud. 

The Point,
The show goes on!

Fact 3
we're talking about 20,000 dollars or more a week taken in by the use of fraud in this scam and once again we have documented that the DPR has failed to act to protect the interest of the (public) consumers or, the interest of the State of Florida's tax payers. 

The Point,
 The DPR is covering up for it's incompetence or,
it's an accomplice in allowing this scam to continue and that's called corruption.
We're all being ripped off via a DPR issued license to steal!!!   

Additionally, before you clear the DPR of any wrong doing you should review all the past correspondence  from the DPR that we have gathered over the last two years as contained within my records because it will not only shock you but it will effectively serve to take down the agency so don't patronize me while you  to further attempt to continue this cover up.

Furthermore, in a confidential letter to us the DPR suggested that we file a civil case because they were powerless to close down these offending agencies or to get any refunds for the victims of one of this states largest scams.   

Fact 4
The total dollar losses here are much bigger then in the Miss. Cleo case......................

Within letters, and email the DPR has admitted that they are unable to enforce the laws of this state. 
The DPR left a paper trail that the media has followed.
My creditability was never in question.
Please rest assured that I wouldn't make these serious allegations unless,
I had the evidence to fully back up my charges. 

If you had (really cared) to properly research this matter you should have contacted us because,
obviously your only getting the covered up version of the (lack of facts) from the DPR.

Additionally,
 on that note you should have called the investigator from the consumer protection agency that made these (off the record statements) to me and you should talk to the investigators at the Florida Attorney Generals office that have also referred directly to this matter before you deny that this was ever the case. 
I also have several letters from the Attorney Generals office regarding this very matter. 
Please note that other law enforcement agencies have stated to us that they stand ready to help these victims and the DPR with this matter if the DPR cares to do it's job of enforcing the State statues that they have been charged with enforcing. 


Fact 5
Your agency is charged with enforcing the State Statutes and you haven't done your job in the last two years and these victims would have lost their rights under the statute of limitations to get any refunds. 

(a) Did you notice the States Attorney's offices of any of these crimes? 
(b) Did you bring any action to shut down these scams or to collect any restitution for the victims? 
(c) Did you notice the state IRS about unreported revenue and unreported sales taxes?

                                                             I rest my case.


But mark my words,
The media will act to take down the incompetent head of the DPR and all of her like flunkies. 
And, if I were the Governor I'd fire the whole lot of you for trying to cover up your agencies incompetence.  
I truly wish for state hearings on this matter because as we all know that you can't have the fox guarding the chicken coop. 


Sincerely, 
Mr. Rick West      

............................................................................................................................................................................

Dear Mr. West: 

Governor Jeb Bush has provided the Department of Business and Professional Regulation your most recent correspondence regarding a complaint involving a talent agency in Hillsborough County. I would like to address some of your e-mail to the best extent possible. 

Upon receiving your e-mail, I personally contacted the department's general counsel, the director for the Division of Professions, the current and former prosecuting attorneys for talent agents and the lead investigator in charge for the Division of Regulation in Hillsborough County. I do understand you may have spoken to some of these individuals about the case, nevertheless, it was my objective to be confident all possible means and resources were being used to resolve your complaint in an expeditious manner. It is important to note that any pending investigation is prohibited from public disclosure until 10 days after probable cause has been found and an administrative complaint is filed by the Department. Unless those events have occurred, it would be unlawful for me to discuss the details of that complaint. 

From my research, I have found no evidence that anyone in the Department has hindered or obstructed the efforts of any law enforcement officials in Hillsborough County. As a matter of course, information collected by our investigators is immediately forwarded to the appropriate local authorities if criminal wrong-doing may be involved. 

As you may know, as a matter of effective prosecution, it is the department's view that if there is a pending civil case against a licensee, it is often better to wait for the outcome of that case and then pursue an administrative complaint rather than initiate a complaint during that process. This is because a civil judgment may often be used to establish an additional violation.

Finally, I truly believe that the department has properly marshaled its resources to investigate your case and others similar to yours in the most effective manner. We certainly appreciate and value the information you have and continue to provide as it continually improves our ability to pursue potential improper licensed activity. In the near future, I am confident you will be satisfied with the effort put forth by our investigative and legal team. 

If you have additional concerns, please contact our head prosecution attorney for professional licensees, Gail Scott-Hill at (850) 922-0907. 

Thank you for your support and understanding.

Dear Jeb,
 
By now you probably know about the many problems that the residents of Pinelas County have experienced with a "creative" investor by the name of Mr. Donnie Connally. 
 
Everything that has been done by the Appraiser, Tax Collector and Clerk of Circuit Court was legal.  We have a law that has been in place for decades and has served to protect property owner rights very well until these past few years.  A minor tweeking can prevent this type of situation from occuring again. Senator Sebasta and Represetative Gus Bilirakis are working with county officials to craft legislation that will protect all property owners' rights and close loop holes to prevent what has happened in Pinellas, Manatee and now Hillsboro County from occuring again..
 
My e-mail is to request that if you have to go into special legislation this year and we all know how expense that is, but I also  know that residents in Pinellas and now probably in the entire state of Florida would appreciate your hearing this legislation this year.  You would be a hero for all residents in Pinellas and hopefully no other property owner in the state of Florida what have to go thru what we are experiencing in Pinellas County.  
 
If you need additional information, I would be glad to share with you more details.
 
Respectfully,
 
Diane Nelson, 
Pinellas County Tax Collector

Florida tops list of nation's vacationers. More Florida stuff as well.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Jennifer Sergent: Congress may spend $100 million to promote tourism despite industry's 'road to recovery'
-----------------------------------------------------------------
(5/25/02 Naples Daily News)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
WASHINGTON — Amid reports that the travel industry is "on the road to recovery," Congress is still considering legislation to spend $100 million to help states promote tourism. 

Three-quarters of Americans said the 9/11 attacks wouldn't dampen their summer travel plans, according to an AP poll released Thursday. And the Travel Industry Association of America is forecasting an increase in travel for this summer season. Florida tops all other states on vacationers' destinations, the group said. 

Florida Republican Mark Foley, co-chair of the Congressional Travel and Tourism Caucus, testified Thursday that the travel industry is "hemorrhaging" and in desperate need of a federal kick-start. 

The need doesn't seem to be as desperate in Florida, however. Using a combination of state and private funds, the state's tourism corporation will complete a $76 million advertising campaign next month that started in early October. 

In years before the terrorist attacks, the Visit Florida corporation would spend "maybe $25 million" in a year, spokesman Tom Flanigan said. 

"This has been an absolutely monumental effort without precedent," Flanigan said. 

The state recorded a 19 percent decrease in visitors during the fourth quarter of last year, the first decrease ever in a 10-year span during which tourist numbers increased each year between 5 and 8 percent. 

The first quarter of this year wasn't as bad. The decrease in visitors was just 4.5 percent from the same time last year. 

"We're still not on par yet," Flanigan said, but the numbers were "a vast improvement" over last year's fourth quarter. 

Other promising indications for Florida tourism include record numbers of auto traffic into the state, based on the numbers of tourists coming into the state's highway visitor centers, Flanigan said. Those numbers are 8 percent ahead of last year. 

"I would suspect that we're doing better than most other U.S. destinations," he said. "Our pace of recovery is better than the norm." 

************** 

IT'S NOT EVERY DAY that a U.S. senator climbs up on the couch to greet a constituent. 

But Sen. Bill Nelson, who is 5-foot-10 1/2, found it necessary to do that Thursday when he was asked to pose for a picture with 6-foot-10 Miami Heat center Alonzo Mourning. 

Height jokes aside, and once they were both properly seated in chairs, the conversations shifted to children's issues, the focus of Mourning's extensive charity work. 

Mourning was in Washington to lobby for $1 million in federal funding for a youth center in the Overtown section of Miami. Mourning wants the center to be a model for future endeavors across the state and nation, because it would target and monitor at-risk youth and families. 

Only one in 12 students in Overtown graduate from high school, Mourning said, adding that "people have ignored it for too long." 

That's where Congress comes in, he said. 

"We've tap-danced for some private dollars," he said, "but it's going to come down to: we need some government money." 

"This isn't a YMCA," Mourning said, chortling at the notion. "We've got plenty of those." 

This center would pick up where the state case workers leave off — or never appear, for that matter. Employees will keep track of the kids and their families, serve as role models, and help them stay in school and on the right track. 

"We're going to try to get everyone involved in the development of these kids," Mourning said. 

Nelson set up a conference call with Mourning's congresswoman, Rep. Carrie Meek, D-Miami. Meek admonished her Senate colleague to request the million dollars for the 2003 budget of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 

" 'Zo has to have this right away," Meek told Nelson. "You pledge to get the money he needs." 

"You know the watchword over here," Nelson said to Meek. "Whatever Carrie wants, Carrie gets." 

But in a year when budgets will be tight and the government is running a deficit, Nelson and Meek face an order taller than even Alonzo Mourning.

Jeb:

En días pasados la Junta escolar redujo dos días del salario de los
maestros (y de empleados que ganan más de $20,000.) debido a la falta de
fondos del presupuesto. Como bien tú sabes, esto se debe al desperdicio
de dinero que ha habido en el distrito escolar. Sin embargo, muchos han
utilizado esta decisión para culparte a tí (por razones políticas)
diciendo que la causa ha sido la reducción de fondos de tu parte a la
educación. Yo creo que es importante de que se haga un análisis del
presupuesto y se aclare esta situación. 

Sería bueno que pidieras una revisión de los gastos (yo puedo ayudarte
en hacer un análisis del presupuesto) para que quede aclarado cómo se
están desperdiciando los fondos que el distrito escolar recibe a pesar
de que tú has aumentado el presupuesto de  educación. Si se hacen
reducciones en áreas que no tengan impacto directo en ls niños, se
pudieran restablecer los 13 millones necesarios para los dos días de
salario de los empleados.

Avísame lo que quieras hacer al respecto.

Mine to grow near pristine river
State environmental concerns won't halt mine, but push back cement plant
opening.
By JULIE HAUSERMAN, Times Staff Writer
C St. Petersburg Times
published May 25, 2002

BRANFORD -- Four years after Gov. Jeb Bush canoed the aqua-blue
Ichetucknee River and vowed to protect it, his administration is about
to permit a nearby limestone mine to grow by eight times despite ongoing
environmental violations.

The mine is part of the Suwannee American Cement plant near Ichetucknee
State Park, a controversial project that Bush and the Department of
Environmental Protection denied in 1999 but approved a year later after
the company sued.

The state permit will allow the mine to grow from 100 acres to 800 and
operate for 100 years.

Permitting the mine expansion is so politically sensitive that Bush and
David Struhs, secretary of the DEP, abruptly slapped new restrictions on
the cement plant after the St. Petersburg Times began asking questions.

Bush initially said he was unaware of the mine expansion, although the
DEP has been reviewing the permit for two years. After a briefing, he
and Struhs decided to permit the mine but bar the cement plant from
opening for two years. The plant was supposed to open late this year.

Delaying the plant opening allows the state to "turn the mining story
into the object lesson you want it to be," Struhs said Bush told him.

The lesson: The state's hands are tied by weak laws.

In March, DEP inspectors discovered that air quality monitors at the
cement plant construction site hadn't worked for months. The monitors
were supposed to measure background air quality before the plant opened.
The company paid a $16,000 fine.

That violation will delay the plant's operating permit, Struhs said.

The company expressed surprise at the decision and said it had been
working with the state on the problem. "We've gotten the problem
solved," said Jim McLelland, spokesman for Anderson Columbia, Suwannee
American's parent company.

But it's not the only violation, records show:

In August 2001, sinkholes opened under a stormwater pond on the plant
property. The company alerted DEP and hired an engineer, who found a
pond was dug 2 feet deeper than the state permit allowed. More sinkholes
could form, the engineer said, creating a "natural pathway for
unfiltered surface water to mix with groundwater." The company filled
the new sinkholes with concrete, but the engineer noted: "The potential
for future collapse . . . will continue to be a factor." The DEP didn't
fine the company.

Suwannee American has a small cement plant at the construction site to
make material to build the new plant. In February, state inspectors
discovered that equipment to catch pollution from the small plant had
blown off. The company paid a $4,000 fine.

The company has had other violations in the Panhandle. In February 2001,
the DEP fined Anderson Columbia $178,000 for pollution at a construction
project on Highway 98 in Santa Rosa County. The company is challenging
the fine.

On Wednesday, the company agreed to pay $3,250 for pollution from road
work on Interstate 10 in Escambia County.

Four years ago, Struhs and Bush said a company's environmental record
should be considered when it applies for a permit. Struhs said road
builder Anderson Columbia had such a bad environmental record that it
was too risky to allow the cement plant in a water-rich part of Florida.


"Air quality permits will not be issued to demonstrated high-risk
applicants in high-risk areas at this DEP," Struhs wrote in a memo.

Struhs later said the DEP was on shaky legal ground because loopholes in
state law make it hard for the DEP to deny permits based on a company's
record. Facing a lawsuit, the DEP reversed itself and issued the permit.


During secret negotiations, the DEP extracted concessions from the
company, including an agreement to sell another mine the company owned
in Columbia County to taxpayers for $23-million to protect the
Ichetucknee headwaters.

But that mine is 21/2 times smaller than the one the company now wants
to build. The company quietly applied for a permit for the bigger mine
in October 2000, four months after it got the cement plant permit.

On Thursday, Struhs told the St. Petersburg Times that he and Bush had
reviewed the company's record and decided to delay the cement plant's
operating permit. They planned to act next month but accelerated the
decision because of the newspaper's inquiries.

"What really drove our decision was not wanting to have our issuance of
the mining permit misperceived as overlooking what our obvious and
well-known compliance problems are with this company," Struhs said.

On May 1, the state published a legal notice about its intention to let
the mine expand in the twice-weekly Suwannee Democrat in Live Oak. The
time for public comment expired this week.

A few local environmentalists knew about the bigger mine, but didn't
mount much opposition.

For one thing, their fight against the cement plant had been frustrating
and bitter. At one point, protesters chained themselves together outside
the governor's office. Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth
intervened on behalf of the citizens, and lost.

The citizens who filed suit against the cement plant were shunned in
Suwannee County, where leaders wanted the 100 jobs and property taxes
the plant would provide. After the citizens lost, Suwannee American sued
the citizens to make them pay the company's legal bills. A judge
refused.

"We tried to find a way to challenge it, but the mining regulations in
the state are extremely lax," said Kathy Cantwell, chairwoman of the
Suwannee-St. John's chapter of the Sierra Club.

Struhs agrees. "We cannot legally deny the permit to expand the mine,"
he said. "We've got to change the laws."

This year, Struhs lobbied legislators to make environmental history
count when a company applies for a permit, but the bill didn't go
anywhere. Bush didn't publicly push for the law, as he did with other
legislation.

In Suwannee County, neighbors worry that the giant mine will threaten
underground water. Heavy equipment will tear limestone out of the earth
near the Ichetucknee, Santa Fe and Suwannee rivers -- all ranked as
Outstanding Florida Waters. Ichetucknee Springs State Park draws 200,000
visitors a year. The DEP's mining bureau says the mine "is not
perceived" as a threat to the park.

Groundwater beneath the mine flows toward the Santa Fe River, not the
Ichetucknee, state scientists say. The Santa Fe connects with the
Suwannee and flows underground for part of its length. The state is just
starting to study how water moves in the area. The mine will be 2 miles
from the Santa Fe at its closest point.

"Will the mine affect the flow of groundwater? Absolutely," Struhs said.
"Will it contaminate the groundwater? That depends on how you define
contamination."

The permit says if the company punches through limestone, workers will
stop, report it and plug the hole.

"When they mine, they are going to break through these caverns," said
Svenn Lindskold, president of Save Our Suwannee, an environmental group.
"When a dragline that's working below the surface breaks through, who is
going to know? Who is going to call? How are they going to plug it?"

On an empty stretch of U.S. 27 near Branford, the cement plant's giant
smokestacks are rising above the treeline.

"It's going to be the big landmark in the area," said Clarence McNamee,
a nearby resident who challenged the plant.

The plant will burn coal and tires and release about 3,100 tons of
pollutants every year, including 97 pounds of mercury, which
environmentalists say could taint fish in the three nearby rivers. The
DEP says the plant will have more pollution controls than any other
cement plant in Florida.

Among those who tried to stop the plant, there's bitterness about
allowing heavy industry in one of Florida's finest places.

The DEP issued the cement plant permit in secret negotiations with the
company, prompting charges of back-room dealing. The company's chief
negotiator was Steve MacNamara, a top aide to then-Florida House Speaker
John Thrasher. DEP staffers later complained that they thought MacNamara
was representing Thrasher, and didn't know he was also on Anderson
Columbia's payroll. The state Ethics Commission found probable cause
that MacNamara violated ethics laws. He is appealing.

Anderson Columbia has figured in several political scandals. At one
point, it had two lawmakers on its payroll, former House Speaker Bolley
"Bo" Johnson and former Lake City Rep. Randy Mackey. Both were convicted
of tax fraud for failing to report Anderson Columbia payments. Johnson
served time in federal prison and Mackey is free while he appeals.

"This was a highly political case," said Patrice Boyes, a Gainesville
lawyer who represented plant opponents. "It's kind of hard for citizens
to combat that kind of pressure. The speaker of the House's aide was on
the company's payroll. It leaves one with a bitter taste of cynicism."

Dear All:

Research reveals that when dads are involved the children do better.  Well, my dear friends, Carlos Delgado and Juan Salinas coached the Everglades K-8 Center Odessy of the mind students to number one in the State of Florida, and on they went to Boulder, CO. for the Odessy of the Mind World Competitions.   He gave me permission to email all of you to tell you that their team took third in the WORLD....Third....why aren't these guys teaching, running a school, they are in the wrong fields.   WOW!   Congratulations to the students, the coaches, the parents and the support group that went.  I think there was a group of 30 who in a month's time pulled together, raised money for flights, accommodations, food, and perhaps a few sight seeing tours.  This is parent involvement at its fineness.  

Wouldn't it be great to have lights, cameras, action when they arrive in Miami tomorrow evening....they leave CO. at 4:00 and should be here by 10:00 PM to 10:30 PM on United Airlines.  I do hope some of us can be there to hug and congratulate the children.  I feel like a proud grandparent knowing that our children have such wonderful opportunities.

Carlos called a number of times since they left and kept me informed of the children's experiences.  They traded Florida pins and as the children from China to Poland said "we want the special pins," those special pins were the Dade County Council PTA Pins"  I gave them about hundred before they left and I should have given them several hundred.  They even told the other children what PTA/PTSA stands for and what we do.  What great ambassadors they are for PTA/PTSA.  

In Carlos' usual style he felt so bad because FC Martin Elementary Odessy team came in fourth and they didn't get a trophy.  Typical of Carlos to worry about other teams.  Coral Reef Senior High is also out there and they also didn't place in the top three but did a great job according to Carlos.  We are so proud of all of them.  

Carlos also reported that the children began exchanging their team shirts.  The experience for these children to meet and create new friendships with other children throughout the world is an education in itself.  If only children could run the world...we would have peace and love.  They are so innocent.  Isn't it a wonderful world, and as Red Fox says, it is what we do to it that makes it not so wonderful.  Let us vow to keep this a Wonderful World for the children.

Again, congratulations to the children, their coaches, parents and the support group who went and those who encouraged them from home.

May your weekend be a safe and delightful togetherness time.  If you have time join me at the airport to greet the children.  

Love,
Karin

Subject:	Board of Medicine Surgical Care Committee Meeting

I am passing this letter along to everyone from a CRNA who attended the Board of Medicine's Surgical Care Committee meeting in Tampa yesterday.  It is sad that the anesthesiologists have taken over our practices and we didn't even get the privilege of selling our individual practices since they just walked in and took them from us.  I know that the anesthesiologists who have taken over my offices, which I spent 21 years building the group, don't even know the proper techniques of inserting LMAs or just feeling comfortable in the office setting.  I believe it will only be a matter of time before the deaths begin happening again.  I have heard that there have already been a few hospital admissions.  There were no problems after the safety rules went into effect from CRNAs.  After all, we are the ones who administer the anesthesia and they usually just watch us work.  I am leaving the State on July 1, 2002 to work in New Hamphsire and will continue to monitor Florida from my computer.  I wish everyone the best and hope that something can happen legislatively to stop an unelected board from destroying health care in Florida.  If I were the Governor I would change the appointed members of the BOM and ask the leadership in the House & Senate to "fix" the law so the power of the BOM did not exceed the Legislature.  Take care and I will see you all at the FANA meeting. 
Sandra Darling 


>Dear Colleagues, 
>   
>I had the privilege of attending the meeting of the BOM surgical care committee meeting and hate to be the barer of bad news but the Committee voted 3 to 1 to leave things the way they are and not to reverse the anesthesia rule to the way it was prior to April 15th.  Four out of five committee members heard strong testimonies from our side and initially the vote was tide Dr.Gustavo and Dr. Kent were for reversing the rule and Dr Miguel (?) an anesthesiologist and Dr. Nigel (ER doctor) voted to leave things the way they are.  Dr. Tom Andrews an anesthesiologist with JLR medical and the newly elected president of the FSA argued that CRNAs were not ethical and did not have the best interest of the patient in mind if they thought they should be doing anesthesia without the supervision of an anesthesiologist. He also argued that until the BOM stopped CRNAs from doing Level 3 anesthesia patients were dying by the 100's in Florida. Another anesthesiologist from South Florida argued that even though things have improved and there have not been anymore deaths in the offices per se, that was not enough data to permit the committee to recommend that the ban on level 3 for CRNAs be lifted.  They kept arguing that the BOM n>eeded to wait until more data could be collected, however for that data to show that things have truly improved from what the BOM had done up to the point of April 15th CRNAs would need to be permitted to continue to do level 3 anesthesia in order to indeed show that the outcome would be the same. But no one addressed that issue in my opinion and skirted around it. 
>   
>The arguments were strong from our side but in the end MDs backup MDs in that Dr. Gustavo wanted the FAS and the FANA to set down and come to an agreement on indirect supervision of CRNAs in the offices by Anesthesiologist. His argument was that surgeons did not have the anesthesia expertise to supervise CRNAs even though our side said that surgeons would be required to complete 8 hours of Anesthesia training (pharmacology and difficult airway management) every two years. He further stated that he wanted CRNAs to do what they were trained to do (general anesthesia) yet admitting that he had little experience with working with CRNAs. He then changed his vote to leave things as they are and hope that Dr Tom Andrews could persuade the FSA to bang out an agreement with the FANA and maybe come to some agreement on indirect supervision. 
>   
>How indirect supervision is going to do anything beats the hell out me.  As bad as Tom Andrews hates CRNAs and wants to see them go away or become slave labor under the FSA , I don't see this happening.  I know him personally and if he had his way CRNAs would go away forever throughout the United States. He is a believer of MDA anesthesia only.

Sorrow but it is now 1:38 AM and I am getting punchy not to mention being mad as hell about the outcome.

I think then the governor will be forced to take measures to end this.  At this point what do we have to lose. The next thing will be that we can't work at all without an anesthesiologist to supervise us. 
>   
>I am thinking very seriously about turning in my Florida license and moving to another state and chalk all this up to a learning experience.  We have played with kid gloves, we have danced around the truth but are afraid to say what the problem really is, money hungry anesthesiologist trying to increase their pocketbooks in a marketplace of decreased reimbursement and the only way they can do that is to take away our livelihood and control the CRNAs right to practice according to the laws of this state and it is all done under the disguise of PATIENT SAFETY. Once they have us unable to work anywhere without them our incomes will drop. They will decide what you will make per hour if you think that $42.00/hour (that is what Dr. Tom Andrews' group pays their CRNAs) no time and half for overtime just a straight $42.00/hour is low just wait, you will be making what you made as an ICU nurse.  If you don't believe me just let this happen and I will tell you "I TOLD YOU SO"

>Since, I spoke bluntly but truthfully before the BOM and in front of Dr. Andrews I am sure that my days of working in Florida or at least within 100 plus miles of home are numbered.  I say that because I contracted with his group and after the AA issue and my trip to speak with my Senator in Tallahassee my contract with that group was cancelled abruptly without cause.

Dear Governor Bush:  Osceola is the largest growing County in Florida and is projected as such for 5 years.  I am a Principal's secretary and have been for 11 years.  I have seen this county go from a small town to a busy city.  The students ratio to teacher in our classrooms (4th grade) is 31 to 1.  We do not have the funding for smaller ratios.  Please take a look at Osceola County and understand that we need more money to help our students and relieve our teachers.  
 
We have been receiving the lowest amount per capita for school construction in the state for the last five years and we need new schools.  As soon as we build them, they are filled to capacity.
 
I appreciate anything that you can do for us.

Subject: Provision 386 of the legislative budget


Carlton Manor is a community based group residential treatment program for
severely emotionally disturbed children. We currently have 16 children ages
7-15 in two therapeutic group homes of eight each, and 10  therapeutic
foster care placements. Our agency has been providing cost efficient,
therapeutically effective treatment to the residents of Pinellas County for
20 years. We offer intensive family therapy as part of our program, and
parents care for their children every weekend with the goal of teaching
parents ways to reduce the incidence of disturbed behavior and improve their
parenting skills. Our goal is to reinforce the child's membership in the
family and avoid out of home placement.

We have been funded through Sun coast Region ADM funds, matching funds from
the Juvenile Welfare Board and other resources. Provision 386 effectively
will close our facility  and our  children  will be left without services or
will require transfer to an institutional setting(SIPPS). A number of our
families are not Medicaid eligible and could  be placed in the position of
considering relinquishing their parental rights to the state to receive
treatment through the SIPPS program. Others will not qualify for SIPPS and
will be left only with home-based services which have already been proven
ineffective with these children.

In a Capitol ALERT from the Florida Council for Behavioral Healthcare DCF's
Sue Ross is quoted as saying that she and her staff will be meeting with
Family Safety staff to review options for developing residential treatment
settings and other services for children who do not meet SIPP criteria or
who are being discharged from SIPP.  We are already in place and provide
these exact services.  We have a proven track record. Why eliminate
programs, and then start over?
Please change the language in this provision and block the  transfer of  $16
million from the PRTS budget to the SIPP services, and the transfer of funds
from already sadly lacking children's services to forensic beds in jails.
Thank you for considering  a budget change....... For the children's sake.

      Dear Mr. Bush,
            I am writing to you in hope that you can
help me.Not to long ago you came to Lakeland,Fl,where
my home is,and spoke briefly with my parents.My
parents had number 69, you only had a chance to see 50
people so you gave them this email address in case
they needed further help.My situation is that I am in
kidney failure.I have what is formally known as End
Stage Renal Disease.Under the Medicare health plan
there is a paticular set of guidelines for this
disease.It states that after three months of continous
dialysis I am entitled to Medicare benifits.My start
date for dialysis was March 1,2002.Under these
guidelines my benifits should go into effect June
1,2002.This should be the case,however it is not.Mr.
Alexander from the Social Security office(863-683-0611
ext.226)has my case.Mr Alexander has been noncompliant
from the beginning.He does not return calls and never
seems to have an answer as to why so many problems
have occured in my recieving benifits.Anne at Adam
Putman's office has already been working hand and hand
with us.She has had to call Mr. Alexander herself many
times to straighten out errors and oversights.Here is
the main problem now.I recieved a letter stating that
Mr.Alexander would let me know about my benifits
before or on May 22,2002.The first I heard from him is
the call that I made to his office today.He says that
my benifits are not set up and that it is the
Baltimore office's fault.A month ago he assured Anne
that everything was in place.Now he is saying that my
benifits are not set up and that there is nothing he
can do.My medicaid coverage becomes only a supplement
as of June 1,2002.My life sustaining dialysis
treatment is $3000.00 per month not including the
medications , doctors appontments, and possible
hospital visits.On top of this, I need to have the
access in my arm fixed,which requires surgery,which no
one will do without Medicare.I have a port cath in my
chest that I recieve Dialysis through right now.This
cath is only good for six month,I've already had it
four.It also has to stay in another four weeks after
my arm is fixed so that my arm will heal.I also have
an appiontment with Lifelink for a workup for a

the Medicare card to process me through and put me on

DIE.My father was laid off last week and we are

I am a college student. I am the typical girl next

that you can help.I know that by you taking the time
to come down here to a relatively small city and

Dear Governor,

I am writing on behalf of a great number of citizens that are about to lose their homes in the Miami, Miramar area.  They are about to undergo foreclosure procedures from an unscrupulous Homeowner Association (HOA).  These citizens have been fighting for the last four years to protect themselves from a group of corrupt individuals that have been trying to steal their homes, their dreams, their hopes, all that they have worked for with so much sacrifice, and everything else the American Dream is all about. 

In this country, I have been able to realize many of my dreams, but I have also experienced first hand how it almost turned into a nightmare after buying my first home. A few months after buying my house, to my surprise, I began to be harassed by one of the two HOAs that my house belonged to, threatening to sue me for ridiculous and frivolous reasons.  To make a long story short, after realizing that I was not the only victim of their attacks, I was able to rally support from a great number of homeowners, and at the annual elections, for the first time since the HOA was formed in 1983, we got enough people interested to get a quorum and were able to throw out the tyrannical HOA, and put a brand new board.  In my efforts to rally support from my neighbors, I also became a member of the other HOA in my community, only to find out that one person (the president) controlled all the affairs of that board and had an unusually great interest in foreclosing on as many homes as possible.  I opposed him on foreclosing on 15 homes, just to become his worst enemy, to the point that I was almost jumped on the street by him and another individual (I opened a police report but he did not hit me, and I had no witnesses, so I could not press charges).  

Since then, I have learned of the widespread nature of this problem.  Homes are being foreclosed by unscrupulous HOAs at an alarming rate all over the USA, from California to Florida and everywhere in between, targeting low-income families, widows, and the elderly, especially if a home has a considerable amount of equity to maximize their ill-obtained gains when foreclosing on them.  These corrupt individuals, under the pretense that they are interested in the well being of homeowners, have especial interest groups lobbying at the federal and state level to make sure law is passed to protect their own interests, creating loopholes they can use to perpetuate their evil acts.  In my view, the most dangerous of these loopholes is the law that allows them to place liens and foreclose on someone’s home.  This loophole, and the fact that it is not currently required to have a jury decide on the validity of a foreclosure (as is actually mandated in the Seventh Amendment of our Constitution) makes it very easy for these heartless and corrupt individuals to abuse the system, and ultimately hurt many of us.  Despite all of this, I believe that there is hope because there are many ways to solve this problem, such as a porososed Mandated Property Reform Task Force.  I could share some more possible solutions with you, but it would make this letter way too long.  However, whenever you have some time, please check some of the possible solutions at: http://www.ccfj.net/Proprightscomm.htm, an organization of which I am a committee member. 

Finally, I would like to share with you what actually inspired me to write this letter.  A couple of days ago, I spoke with Tay, a homeowner that is about to lose her home, unless a miracle happens.  She is a single mother of six.  Her youngest, only six, has seen how sick she has gotten worrying over the possibility of not being able to provide a roof under their heads.  All that she has worked for all her life is just about to crumble right in front of her, but she keeps the faith and tries to cheer her children, assuring them that there is a God, that justice will prevail, and that somehow they will not lose their home.  In his innocence, her youngest asked her what the word justice meant.  She went on to explain the meaning of the word.  After she had finished, he told her that he wanted to leave this country because it did not have justice.  She has been crying since.  The day I spoke with her, she was very sick, and could barely speak.  When she told me what had happened, I felt very sad, and could hardly contain my tears.  I know how that kid felt.  I felt the same way when I was a kid seeing the injustices I lived in my native country, Nicaragua.  The USA, and what it stands for was my only hope, and it is the only hope for many kids around the world.  This hope seems to be vanishing before our own eyes.  My wife is about to have our first born, and now more than ever, I vow to fight the evildoers that are destroying and corrupting this country.  We must defend this country to keep alive the flames of hope and freedom that it represents.

I know how busy you must be, the many worries you must have, and I would like to thank you for taking the time to read my letter.  I would really appreciate your help on this matter.  I want to assure you that I am keeping you, your family, and especially your brother in my personal and family prayers.  May God bless you and our country.


Regards,

Mario Jimenez Jerez

I hope this finds you and your family do well.

Not so long ago, I heard that you were going to allow teachers from one
county to transfer to other counties in Florida, without losing any
tenure.   Has this been put into effect?

As you know, my fiancé Donna, teaches fourth grade in Broward County and
she would like to relocate closer to our home but Donna does not want to

Right now, Palm Beach will allow you to transfer 10 but Donna has been

Look on page 270 of the budget, line item 2057A has $178,000 for exterior weatherproofing restoration.  We have that coded with a C.  Also, look at the proviso language at the beginning of that program on bottom of page 268, it looks as though the performance measures relate to the institute.  Is this what you were expecting to see?  I can dig more if you need for me to.

Governor Bush,

I am on the Board of Directors for the New Port Richey Marine Institute.
I would like to urge you to fund this very worthwhile program in 
whatever capacity that you can for the 2002-3 school year. This is a 
program which targets those students who are at risk. It has been 
responsible for altering the lives of young people and putting them 
on the right track in becoming productive young people.
Your attention to this cause is deeply appreciated.

Your truly,

	Bush vetoes DCF aid bill that allowed
	fundraising
	BY CAROL MARBIN MILLER
	
	As controversy continued over Gov. Jeb Bush's administration of the Department of Children & Families, the governor on Friday vetoed a bill, which passed the Legislature unanimously, designed to help social service
	administrators receive private donations.
	 
	The bill, introduced in the House by Rep. Kenneth A. Gottlieb, would have allowed the DCF to create a fundraising arm to solicit and accept contributions from companies and individuals. It passed the House and Senate without a single 'no' vote.
	 
	In a letter to Secretary of State Katherine Harris Friday, Bush said he rejected the bill because it was contrary to his core beliefs against big government.
	 
	''One of the most important goals of my administration is to reduce and streamline government in order to maximize services,'' Bush wrote. ``To achieve that goal I have emphasized the importance of partnering with communities and the private sector, and transforming our health and human service delivery system from one that is government-based to one that is community-based.
	 
	''Encouraging state agencies to reinforce themselves through the establishment of direct-service organizations expands and promotes government and therefore is counter to this goal,'' Bush wrote.
	 
	Gottlieb, a Miramar Democrat, was palpably upset by the veto.
	 
	''He doesn't give tax money [to social services], and now we can't even give voluntary money,'' he said. ``From the goodness of your heart, you can't even give a contribution.''
	 
	The veto comes at a time when the DCF is facing a firestorm of criticism following the disappearance of 5-year-old Rilya Wilson from state custody perhaps 16 months ago. The girl is still missing.
	 
	Gottlieb's bill would have created ''direct support organizations'' for the DCF and the Department of Elder Affairs. The not-for-profit groups would have had the ability to accept private money on behalf of the government agencies. Florida State University and the University of Florida have several such fundraising arms.
	 
	An analysis of the bill by the House Committee on Child & Family Security said the proposal had no apparent downside.
	 
	''The legislation creates a vehicle for receiving money to benefit each department and its programs and projects,'' the report stated. ``The provision allowing the corporation to raise funds to accomplish its purpose should be to the benefit of each department, which does not presently have
	such authority.''
	 
	Gottlieb said he was particularly concerned with the plight of Floridians who are disabled when he wrote the bill. About 9,000 disabled Floridians are on a waiting list for a variety of services, and the lawmaker had hoped the fundraising arm might help the DCF bring in new money to help them.
	 
	In recent weeks, however, Gottlieb was hoping Floridians would be moved to donate in order to help the state better care for foster children. ``If you read about Rilya Wilson, you might want to donate money to the program so that this doesn't happen again.''

Is there a sound reason that DCF cannot be further dismantled?  I strongly believe if protective services and foster care went under their own department, there would be improvement.  No DA can check all of the programs for which they are responsible.  I worked in Quality Control and FC records were a nightmare as far as Medicaid eligibility went.  I think if a District Adm were only responsible for 2-3 programs, there would be light at the end of the tunnel--people would truly be working together and know eachother.  This in turn would help to halt your turnover in staff.  As a former supervisor, a worker does not really earn their pay for a year.

Querido Jeb:
Te pido un favor. En Venevision Internacional soy Asesor General, título pomposo
para mi poco o ningún mando.  Promuevo la imagen de la empresa, la menciono en
los actos en que intervengo -ahora estoy muy de moda- y he traído a almorzar a
Alex Penelas, Raúl Martínez, Manny Díaz y otros, a las oficinas del Edificio de
los Leones, 550 Biltmore Way, Coral Gables, Piso 11. para que les expliquen las
actividades de la empresa.
Venevisión Internacional pertenece a la Organización Cisneros, es una coporación
norteamericana, distribuye filmes en español con títulos en inglés en EEUU, hace
presentaciones teatrales  y produce programas de televisión para Univisión los
que también vende en Latinoamérica, Europa y Asia, en un gran total de 102
países.
Luis Villanueva, Presidente de VV Internacional, me ha pedido que lo ayude a
saludarte; en una visita que hagas a Miami, o en un almuerzo en estas oficinas,
o en visita que hagamos a Tallahassee. Como Villanueva viaja bastante, en el
caso de tú acceder a esta solicitud- te agradeceríamos una anticipación de la
fecha.
Esta gestión no conlleva propósito alguno comercial, político o de cualquier
índole lucrativa.  Sólo el honor para Villanueva de conversar con alguien de tu
jerarquía y al que admira.

PUNTO Y APARTE

Te agradecería mayor contacto conmigo. Creo que debes ampliar el radio de acción
en tus visitas a Miami.
En cuanto a la visita de W a Miami, duele enterarse por los alardes de otros que
se dicen enterados, habiendo el Partido Ortodoxo Cubano y yo:

1- Enviado más Delegados que todos al Victory Party en Orlando. Pregunta a Al
Cárdenas. Prometí personalmente a W 40 delegados. Los duplicamos.
2- Entregado las llaves del Condado Miami-Dade a W en circunstancias especiales
que después rindieron grandes frutos.
3- Redactado la resolución de apoyo a W por la Delegación de LULAC en Florida.
Fue controversial, atrajo votos hispanos y W se reunió con nosotros..
4 -Escrito y publicado el mayor número de artículos sobre W en la campaña
presidencial.
5- Merecido por esta campaña una carta manuscrita de W.
6- Peleado hasta con los puños para que el conteo de votos fuera justo.

Gracias por la atención que me prestes. El primer punto es mi trabajo y tu ayuda
me ayuda. El segundo es mi corazón.
Un abrazo. Luis Conte Agüero. 2730 SW 19 Terr, Miami FL 33145. Tlf 305-442 3411

Subject: Mentally Challenged Son 


Dear Governor Bush,

Last year, my family and I moved to Florida for a better quality of life. I
met my wife in Orlando when I was stationed at McCoy AFB in 1962. The USAF
transferred us to other states during the Vietnam War and my 23 year
enlisted service.   We returned to Florida in 2001 after being gone for 38
years, 23 of those years in the USAF, 3 years attending college in New
Mexico, and 12 years of employment with MCI in California.  In October of
2000 Florida Power and Light  offered me a management position working in
their new start up company, FPL FiberNet with an office in West Palm Beach.

My wife and son arrived at West Palm Beach in May of 2001.  Since June of
2001 we have been working with the Department Of Children and Families. For
the past 10 months we have been trying to get funding for our 34-year-old
autistic son (Shannon Lee) so he can join a program to help him in
development and to help us with respite care. Shannon has no physical
impairments in mobility.  He loves to participate and be part of programs
during the day.  Before moving here from Southern California, we spoke with
the Department of Children and Families.  They assured us there would be
support and activities available for our son.  After our move we met with
the department agency here in West Palm Beach.  Our son was evaluated and
accepted as a client.  The shocking news that has since followed is hard
for us to accept.  We were told there is no funding and Shannon is on a
waiting list that may be as long as three years before he will be funded.

I observed your speech last week about your family issues.  I was
impressed.  My wife and I also display our feelings when we talk about our
son.  We are having a hard time seeing him sit at home every day with
nothing to do and no development program.  We are writing to you to see if
there is anything that can be done.  Your assistance would be appreciated.

Also, regardless of Shannon's issue, we believe you are the right person
for the job of Florida Governor.  You will have our support at the polls.

Sincerely,

Jeb,
Great seeing you this morning.  As I mentioned, I'm working on putting
together an educational/civic-oriented group designed to help Hispanics
better understand how through the application of conservative principles to
their lives, they can truly live the "American dream".  We've discussed
putting together meetings where a component of each will be to impart very
real and logistical application of concepts to empower people to live their
lives.  While is it non-partisan, the goal is to apply Republican principles
of self-sufficiency, hard work, education, etc., so that people do not
become hooked to the dependency formulas that are way too prevalent in our
society - esp. for minorities - formulas which prevent them from ever fully
accessing all that America has to offer.  Ultimately, we are also interested
in helping them identify leaders/politicians which support these principles.
While I'm not sure what the name may be, I'm leaning to the Hispanic
Conservative Coalition.

As I mentioned to you this morning, I'd like a letter from you supporting
the concept and encouraging the development of this organization.  Moreover,
if we could coordinate it, your agreement to attend the "coming out" press
session.  

Finally, thanks for your support, trust, and belief in principles that will
benefit all Americans.

Dear Governor Bush,

I heard that you recently signed a bill that would greatly raise the
Health Insurance premiums for the small business person. I was unaware
of this bill being considered so I was not able to express my views
earlier. 
I and my wife have a small, Manufacturers Representative, sales business
that I started in 1986. After the first couple of years, the business
grew to the level where I could employ 2 additional sales people.
However, several years ago, the cost of doing busines, mainly the costs
of Federal Taxes, S/S, Insurances and Health Insurance, got to the point
where I had to downsize and terminate these two salemen.  
Around that time, my Health Insurances Costs rose to a point where I
started to look for an alternate insurance plan. I am 60 years old and
have had a continuing health problem for the last 8 years which
precludes me from getting Individual Health Insurance coverage. My only
recourse is a small group, business policy, Insurance for myself plus my
wife as a dependent. Fortunately I found an agent, who makes very little
commision on such a policy, who came up with an insurance company and
policy that had a much reduced premium and provided the medical
coverages that I needed at an affordable cost. However, the cost of this
insurance has continued to increase every year since I started the
policy, having gone up 65% in the last 2 years alone and more than
doubling in the 4 years that I have had this Insurance Coverage. Now I
understand that I may be faced with another 50% or more premium
increase. How is a small business like mine suppose to survive when all
of my income is being used to pay my State and Federal Government
obligations and my Health Insurance? At the current rate of increses,
these costs will soon exceed my company's total income. I need to keep
my company going as a viable business so I can continue to get my
Medical Insurance coverage. I will not be able to qualify for medicare
or medicaid for another 6 years. Where are the funds to pay my
obligations and Health Insurance to come from for these next 6 years?

With the cost of all my insurance continually rising, I have always had
the impression that the State of Florida has caterred to the Insurance
Industry. I am sure that they provide significant amounts of funding for
political campaigns. 

Contrary to every politicians' Rhetoric, the Small Business Person has
received the BRUNT and Biggest Negative Impact of the changes in the
Federal and State Tax and Insurance Laws.  

I have been a loyal Republican Supporter on both the State and Federal
level for over 3 decades. Lately all I am seeing from Republican
Administrations is more personal abuse for the small business person. I
am seriously considering giving the Democrats a chance in the next State
elections and will be promoting this with my small business friends
throughout the state. 

Is it the Insurance Companies that are going to re-elected you as
Governor, or is it the people of this state that will be casting the
votes at election time? Unless something can be done with the burden
placed on independent business people by this insurance Fiasco, I for
one will be campaigning against your re-election. 

Sincerely,

Subject: Flordia's Children Need Our Help


Friday night I saw the segment on 20/20  about the five brothers and one sister that was severely abused and neglected while under the protective care of the Florida Department of Children and Families.  

I am very disappointed in how our state cares for the weakest members of our society. My reason for writing has more to do with trying to find a reasonable solution than it does to tell you how disappointed I am in our state.  Something has to be done and I want to be part of the solution.  

I love children - they need to be loved and protected.  When a child is taken into protective custody and placed into a foster home, the state should protect them.  I would like to see if our community could make home visits since the current system has failed. I chose to believe that the reason these five children were abused and the one in Miami is lost is because the social workers were burdened with caseloads that couldn't humanly be managed.  It is better to believe that, than to believe the entire system is corrupt.

I am Administrative Assistant to the Senior Pastor of Celebration Baptist Church.  One week before Christmas 2000, our church received a call that 100+ foster children in Leon County were not going to receive any gifts for Christmas.  Our church responded in overwhelming fashion.  I don't think that our church is unique.  We have an abundance of churches in Tallahassee and I believe that if we tapped into this resource this overwhelming problem could be turned into a model for other states.

I would welcome the opportunity to talk with you. If that isn't possible, I would like to be a member of a task force that could look for solutions.  Our future depends on our children -

Electoral Dynamics II

--------------------
In poll, Central Florida's Hispanics favor Gov. Bush 
--------------------

By Mark Silva
Sentinel Political Editor

May 27, 2002

TALLAHASSEE -- Gov. Jeb Bush holds an advantage over Democratic rivals among Hispanic voters in Central Florida, according to his campaign's polling of the region crucial to his re-election.

This could provide an important re-election base for Bush, who already enjoys overwhelming support among the Republican-rich Cuban-American community of South Florida.

Both state and national Republican parties are attempting to build that base, with political analysts reading gains for the GOP in the U.S. Justice Department's move to make polling places more accessible for Spanish-speaking voters in Orange and Osceola counties.

The Bush campaign's survey in the critical "Interstate 4 corridor" of Central Florida focused for the first time on Hispanics not of Cuban origin. The Democratic Party was more popular than the GOP among those surveyed, yet most thought Bush is "a different" kind of Republican.

"These voters are critical in a very swing area of the state," said Neil Newhouse, a Virginia-based Bush-campaign pollster. Bush "has a personal appeal among Hispanics that seems to overcome traditional partisan anchors. He seems to connect much better with these voters than the average Republican."

Bush's own popularity -- 60 percent of Hispanics surveyed approve of the job he is doing -- is one factor in his apparent lead among these voters.

Three-quarters of those surveyed were aware the governor speaks Spanish, Newhouse noted, and most knew his wife, Columba, is Mexican.

A widespread unfavorable view of his leading Democratic rival, former U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, is another factor.

In addition, Reno's chief challenger among Democrats, Tampa-area attorney Bill McBride, remains largely unknown among Hispanics.

Democrats are counting on this fast-growing voting bloc to give their nominee an edge against Bush in November, the state party focusing much of its "outreach" to new voters this year on Hispanics.

"In the past, too many candidates have taken the community for granted," said Mo Elleithee, Reno campaign manager. "Janet is not only making an effort to reach out to them in her campaign, but also make it clear that they will have a role in her administration."

Race will 'tighten up'

Bush may have a name-brand appeal today, Democratic Party spokesman Ryan Banfill said, but as his candidates start debating issues, Hispanic voters will take notice: "When the campaign is engaged, and people are given a choice between what Gov. Bush has to offer and what our candidate has to offer, then this race will begin to tighten up."

Yet this bloc offers fertile ground for Florida's bilingual governor -- who voices his own appeals in Spanish-language TV ads -- his campaign counting on 12 percent to 14 percent of the vote coming from Hispanics, with Cuban-Americans accounting for just half.

In addition, the Republican National Committee and Bush administration in Washington have set out to claim a greater share of the nationwide Hispanic vote, which Democrats have long claimed.

The party is airing a monthly television show on Spanish-language stations in select markets, including Orlando. And now Justice is threatening both Orange and Osceola counties with lawsuits regarding their lack of assistance for Hispanic voters at polling places in 2000.

GOP makes Hispanic inroads

The president "has made improving his standing among Hispanic voters a priority," said Dario Moreno, a political scientist at Florida International University in Miami. While the Justice lawsuits may not be political, Moreno said, "The political effect is what's interesting."

Nationally, GOP efforts appear to be yielding results.

The New Democratic Network, an assembly of moderate congressmen, released a survey last week showing the president's approval among Hispanics has grown from 38 percent in November 2000 to 76 percent in May.

Democrat Al Gore carried nearly two-thirds of the Hispanic vote in 2000, but the Democratic survey by Coral Gables pollster Sergio Bendixen shows President Bush and Gore might split the vote in a match today.

Hispanics account for 11 percent of the fast-growing population in a swath of Central Florida ranging from Tampa Bay to Daytona Beach -- as much as 18 percent in Tampa's Hillsborough County, nearly 19 percent in Orange and 29 percent in Osceola.

These voters traditionally have given Democrats an edge on Election Day -- Gore carried Orange County in 2000, the first time a Democrat claimed Orange since Franklin Roosevelt.

"We're not approaching the state as a monolith," Newhouse said. "The population in the state is no longer just Cubans, but also Puerto Ricans and others. We decided to take a real good, hard look at the growing, non-Cuban Hispanic voter."

In its unprecedented, targeted survey of Hispanics in the Orlando and Tampa "media markets" -- counties along I-4 from Tampa to Daytona -- the governor's campaign found that the most likely voters identify themselves in threes: 31 percent Democratic, 29 percent Republican, 27 percent independent -- but the independents strongly lean Democratic.

Alexandria, Va.-based Public Opinion Strategies interviewed 400 likely voters April 17-21.

Among them, 61 percent were Puerto Rican, 12 percent of Mexican origin, 7 percent Colombian, 4 percent Dominican, 7 percent other South Americans, and 10 percent other Hispanics.

The results carry a possible margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.

Education is top concern

The I-4 survey found:


- Education ranked as the No. 1 concern, as it did among all voters, with crime ranking second, the economy third.


- More Hispanics held a favorable impression of the Democratic Party -- 59 percent of those surveyed -- while 47 percent held a favorable impression of the Republican Party.


- Yet 71 percent held a favorable impression of Gov. Bush, 17 percent unfavorable, while 44 percent viewed Reno favorably, 32 percent unfavorably.


- McBride was largely unknown: 71 percent never had heard of him, while 12 percent had a favorable impression, 3 percent unfavorable.


- In a match-up of Bush against Reno: 51 percent supported Bush, 23 percent Reno, with the rest leaning toward one or undecided. In another match-up, Bush got 50 percent, McBride 18 percent.


- Most thought Bush is committed to improving education -- 69 percent. And many said he understands the needs of Central Florida's Hispanic community -- 60 percent.


- Asked whether Bush "is different from most Republicans when it comes to Latino/Hispanic issues," 57 percent said yes. Most -- 76 percent -- were aware that Bush speaks Spanish.

Governor hits road for votes

"I don't think [Bush] is in much danger of losing," said Miranda Luis, a retired state health officer in Tampa who lived for most of his life in Puerto Rico. "I don't see the opposing candidates making much headway."

Bush has campaigned for the Hispanic vote, joining Puerto Rican activists at a recent luncheon at Brisas del Caribe, an Orlando eatery.

Among them was John Quinones, a lawyer running for the Legislature.

"I think what people like about the Republican Party is it provides the opportunity for you to succeed," said Quinones, who moved from Puerto Rico to Orlando 14 years ago.

Reno also has campaigned for the vote.

Last month, Reno walked through Hunter's Creek, an upscale new development in south Orange County, with several Hispanic students from Cypress Creek High School. They met Graziella Figueroa, who moved from New Jersey a year ago.

"I have one big question: the school problem," said Figueroa, complaining of a lack of after-school tutoring for a child with a reading problem.

Hearing Reno explain that she will "go out to the people and persuade the people" to spend more money on education if necessary, Figueroa said Reno has her vote.

"Oh, yes," she said. "Definitely."

McBride, too, has campaigned throughout the I-4 corridor, which his campaign counts on to provide nearly 40 percent of the vote in the Democratic primary Sept. 10.

But while McBride and Reno compete for the Democratic votes of Hispanics in their primary contest, Bush, already comfortable with his Republican base, is targeting the very same Democrats in November.

"The incumbency and the lack of a primary gives him the luxury of focusing on swing voters from the get-go," Bush pollster Newhouse said. "That's an extreme advantage."

Our county is one of the fastest growing in the state.  We need funds to not only build schools, but to also supply the classrooms and, most importantly, hire the highly qualified teachers needed to work with the growing numbers of students.  Our district has one of the largest ESOL populations and we must be appropriately funded if we are to serve the needs of all our students to the levels they deserve. Osceola County is projected to have the fastest growing school system for the next five years.  We need to prepare the students already in our schools and the expected increase in student population as well.  Osceola County has received the lowest amount, per capita, for school construction in the state for the past five years in spite of the exponential growth.  Yet we have one of the highest percentages of students in charter schools in the State.
 
We have used all measures in our power to meet our ever increasing costs to meet critical needs in our county such as:
 
- Levying a full 2 mills
- Sharing in the Local Option Sales Tax
- Levying the highest School Impact Fees in the State
- Levying additional mills for a School Construction Bond Issue
- Established seven charter schools
- Using all effort index dollars
- Using all classroom 1st dollars
 
 
I urge you to support the funding in the Budget in Section 28 on page 416 for fast growing counties now!  
 
Thank you, Zoraida Maldonado

I am forwarding the following to you which is self explanatory, for your attention and action.
 
The stadium of Homestead Senior High School borders on San Remo Circle which is the only street in the complex.  The stadium is exactly in front of my house.  Adults and children frequently gather at the fence to view football practice and games.  
 
Bernhard and Michelle Mueller are my immediate neighbors and friends as well and are extremely responsible individuals.  Bernhard has been telling me about the "activity" and related conversations with school administrators since the fire so I have been aware of it.  
 
Last week on two occasions he took me to the fence and showed me the hole where students frequently pass through, during school time, for unknown reasons.  It appears the fence borders on a vacant property overrun with brush or the like, with some sort of crude road where vehicles are frequently observed parked.   After the sex episodes I finally asked Bernhard to send me an account of the incident(s) to provide the opportunity for me to attempt to clean it up before taking the information, including the videos, to the media.  
 
I am therefore placing it in your hands.
 
Please feel free to contact Bernhard by phone at 786-243-1019 (home) or 904-386-8619 (cell.)  They will both be leaving for Europe on May 31.

Hello Lois,

I have finally composed a summary of events concerning the fire hazard and additional negligences of Homestead Senior High School.

Thank you for your help in resolving that situation.

Bernhard

Summary of Events concerning the Homestead Senior High School


Earlier in April a fire had been caused by students of the Homestead Senior High School threatening the 2200 and 2400 court of San Remo Circle. The reaction of Homestead Senior High School's principal on TV ( I do not remember which channel she was on) stating that she refused to view the issue of her students causing a potential fire hazard to the San Remo community as she did not believe that the youth involved were attending her school motivated me to videotape all ongoing activities to undoubtedly assure that the students in question ARE attending the Homestead Senior High School. I have videotaped students leaving the school grounds using a hole they had cut in the fence at the end of the football field allowing them access to an area close to San Remo 2400 Court. I suspect they will continue to smoke back there as that was the reason a fire had been ignited before. Not only did I tape students "escaping" the school grounds, I also taped them on their way back to the school cafeteria for lunch. To make matters worse I have footage on a student leaving the school grounds using the hole in the fence, mentioned above, during his PE class with a teacher present. To really demonstrate how negligent Homestead Senior High School treats security matters I have gathered footage on two students performing sex on the bleachers in the center of the football field in broad daylight (about noon). They went undisturbed for at least 30 minutes with their activity. I have addressed this matter on numerous occasions with the assistant principal Mr. Todd Meiklejohn who tried his absolute best to improve the situation. Apparently the problem lies within the principal Ms. Leal, who seems to not support Mr. Meiklejohn and also seems to underestimate the depth of the security-problem of her school as she does feel it necessary to have security out on the football field. Just about an hour before I taped the sex session on the 24th of May 2002 I was in Ms. Leal's office and had informed her about ongoing sex sessions on the bleacher in the center of the school's football field. Just as I feel that all possible avenues have been exhausted, I have addressed Mrs. Lois Jones to pass this information on to individuals possessing the necessary contacts and power to improve matters at Homestead Senior High School and therefor eliminating a major hazard for the San Remo Community. I will certainly make the videotape available upon request. 


I am looking forward to finally resolving this situation.


Sincerely,

Bernhard Mueller

To Whom It May Concern:

I was born in Florida, raised in Florida and went to school in Florida. I have my whole family in Florida and now, I must move out of Florida to California or New York or even to Canada just to be a film producer which is what I have always wanted to be. 

This might not concern you now, you may have some huge budget problem or some pending bill that you feel is the most important thing in Florida right now. Think about this, Florida is where the first real film giants came in the beginning of the last century, the government messed that up and they went to California. Today the multi billion dollar business is in need of expansion and here is the Florida climate and the fact that NY and Florida are in the same time zone, letting phone calls with financiers and producers happen at decent hours. All we need is for the present government to go read the history books and learn from the mistakes of the past.

Florida is a low budget state right now because most of the talent has to be flown in from NY and LA. If we started making films like a real state then the talent pool would fill up and the property value would rise and the state tax situations would dissipate. All because you pick up a new customer for the state and most of this revenue would be redirected Canada projects for the next few years.

All I want is to stay here and be a world famous film producer /actor like Mel Gibson has done. It seems that the organizations that operate the film world don't think Florida is the place for great filmmakers to come from.

We need to bring the playing field here in order for the world to see what we can do. Ladies and Gentlemen it is worth the fight in the midst of adversity to gain the future we all deserve.

Sincerely J.C. Greene

Govenor, want you to know what's getting ready to happen here. 


Sandra, & Milt, 

Thank you very much for your efforts on our behalf the past 2 yrs. The people in the know, i.e. the surgeons and nurses who work in the offices where I have provided anesthesia the past 10 yrs., are very unhappy with the inexperience and incompetence of the anesthesiologists who they were forced to hire to replace me after April 15. Fortunately, there are 48 other states who appreciate and need the services of CRNAs, and I will be on working interviews the month of June out of state. I think that the FSA miscalculated when they thought that all of us office CRNAs would come running to their ACTs looking for work after April 15. The BOM ruling will probably make the CRNA shortage worsen. It seems there are just too many anesthesiologists in NJ and FL and I for one am moving on to where my services are more needed and appreciated. 

Paul Lee, CRNA

Subject: Some potential questions to prepare for tomorrow - SUGGESTIONS
ONLY!


1) Panel Diversification - Will you add some more members to blue ribbon
panel for follow up meetings to get an update from dcf in Sept?
	I appointed panel members based on skill sets and immediate need
to address
a horrific situation who had some baseline of experience as i was
seeking a
fast review and recommendation.  With this initial strong, specific
report,
recommendations I would expect some additional community leaders to be
on
the report back from dcf in early sept.

2) Direct Service Organization Veto - This was raised at Sun panel, why
a
veto - Kate said DCF did not need a centralized pool of funds which this
leg
would allow, because dcf has ability to set these organizations up at
local
level - should be viewed as a  way to build local awareness, knowledge
and
involvement - so ability is focused on local level and should be
coordinated
with community based care set up and delivery

3) Adoptions are up, but could be higher - Due to state rules/laws many
kids
in permanent guardianship cannot be adopted - ie placement in perm
guardians
whom are gay, also some permanent placements (even in rodrika sit) are
not
able to adopt due to background of caregivers --

4) Is this all about more money? - Many of recommendations are not about
more money, but about better use of resources with goals and
accountabilities and a focus on moving along community based care
programs.
Need to really look at real numbers for training, ways to work to ensure
training is part of curriculum at social welfare programs offerred at
education institutions - so when they finish college degree they do not
have
to spend weeks in training they could of learned in school = sister
jeanne
thinks this could be helpful and offerred to set up a mtg statewide with
deans of social work colleges to ensure when they graduate they are
ready to
hit the streets immediately.  Base pay increases????  Service First -
the
support of the panel to support service first intent is welcome -
specific
performance metrics, accountability all important

5) Blue Ribbon Panel - calls for Special Session - are you going to call
for
a special session as requested ???"  Many specific suggestions and
deadlines
are set out in recommendations, will work with District 11/dcf team to
ensure guidelines met as outlined, then will review based on
implementation
lessons learned by  Miami Dade/District 11 application to entire system.
From there we will work with leg leadership to determine best forum to
pursue: LBC or organizing session in November.  Much can and will be
done
before legislators meet next March, we need them to be involved and they
will be.

6) Calls for Gov Support of Judge K and Charles Auslander - Report
speaks to
need for continuity of leadership, 6 secretaries in 9 years is part of
the
problem, as sister jeanne said....but specific deadlines have been set
by
this blue ribbon panel and Kate and her team committed to those dates -
She
/they understand seriousness of committent and know ramifications of
known
committments not met.

7) Guaridan ad litem - Think we can build on Blue Ribbon Panel
recommendations to specifically address the concerns addressed in the
history of this program working with courts, dcf and guardians to come
up
with a better program and goal to find/identify/train a guardian ad
litem
for every child in system.....thru new panel, new ideas of recruitment
(faithbased, lawyers and non lawyers, etc etc)

8) Community Based Care: Clearly where system of care needs to get -
helps
all the way around, local involvement, local ownership of problems,
local
awareness, local solutions led.....each can be reflective of their local
community etc

9) Panel very very focused on case load number of per child vs per
investigation(multiple number/children) = want our numbers to show on
both
caseload counts and investigation counts as per child vs how they are
done/.counted today -- this will affect NUMBERS yet again, all they way
across board....DCF appropriations for this area based on caseload and
then
FTE's assigned -- this could/would change.....I think panel focus is
where
gov focus (read frustration:) has been....you may be asked re this, just
want you to understand implications on budget......


Not sure i can think of anything else at this point in time.....
Time to go and find a barbeque

The report you will officially receive tommorrow is good I'm sure. But,
if I may, let me expand upon the recommendations with a specific idea.

With the nation highly aware and sensitive to the use and effectiveness
of technology, a comprehensive technological solution to caring for
Florida's children in state custody, could be the silver bullet to
making this issue go away short term and solving the challenge long
term.

Consider viewing this issue as a "Homeland Defense" matter, where you as
Florida's Governor are working to protect our most valuable resource.
Florida's children.

Envision for a moment. A black box similar to a FEDEX package tracking
unit. This unit has a built in digital camera, a recognition touchscreen
and a wireless link to a  fingerprint and photograph database of all the
children in the care of the state.

Each month, the case worker would visit the child's site. Once there,
photograph and touchscreen fingerprint images would be taken from the
child and matched immediately with central database records to confirm
monitoring of the child. Cellular technology would be used to
triangulate the transmission to pinpoint and confirm the child's
physical location. Brief typwitten reports made onsite containing
relevant info would be immediately transmitted to headquarters.

Unalterable time stamps would reconcile the photgraph, fingerprint,
report and location records taken by case workers to ensure
authenticity.

Exception reports would be created for supervisor's, managers, the
Agency head and you as Governor based upon predefined parameters,
paricularly where norms were violated. Need to know parameters would be
set for the various levels of reporting.

I understand that some of the so-called missing children are in run away
status. Though it may be controversial, a White House ID like tracking
chip could be placed in a unremovable stylish bracelet for flight risk
children.

Th point is to create a "ZERO TOLERANCE" system. It would be the first
of its kind in the nation. All the technology exist today.

One of my technology team member firms currently makes black boxes for
the CIA, NSA and other federal security agencies. They happen to be a
minority owned firm. I would be glad to bring them to town to consult
directly with you and others in designing a solution. These are just my
initial thoughts. Let me know if I can assist.

Dear Governor Bush,
On behalf of the patrons of the dog tracks and poker rooms in Florida, I would like to encourage you to SUPPORT the Senate Bill 160.
Greyhounds are dogs that must run - it is their nature - and they enjoy it.  Greyhounds have very sweet dispositions and make wonderful pets when their careers are over.  It is with this BILL 160 that more greyhounds will be adopted.  Through the SUPPORT of this  legislation, the greyhounds adoption program will be mandatory at ALL dog tracks.  As it is now, more animals are killed in just one humane society shelter than all the greyhounds in the United States.  For this reason alone you should SUPPORT BILL 160.  The POKER ROOMS at the tracks have numerous employees that will be unemployed if the card rooms close.  Increasing the stakes of the poker games will not only bring in more people, but also more revenue to the state of Florida, rather than out to SEA.  I don't think you would want me and the entire staff of the Daytona Beach Kennel Club Poker Room on unemployment.  Our town is a tourist town and work is hard to come by, so about 30 people would definitely make a good dent in your unemployment status.   I AM THE SOLE SUPPORT FOR MY FAMILY - MY HUSBAND CAN NOT FIND A DECENT JOB.  Please do not put me on unemployment - I don not want to be out on the street.  I love working at the Dog Track - really I do not want to have to look for another job.                          Please, Please, Please. SUPPORT BILL 160.                                                            Simone Talarico - AUNTMONE@MSN.com

Bush Brothers , this single individual,Amir Elgendy has ruined a Florida Corporation , SEAVIEW.COM.
One of my best friends has been attempting for over a year to obtain help from the Federal Government , and has been ignored , and even harassed by a attempted S.E.C. charge , which is still floundering along as there is no basis in fact for the charges made.  Now it is finally coming to the forefront that this IRAQI  FAMILY has had previous history of behavior that should have sent them back to Iraq, as the "Egyptian" heritage is another fabrication.As the further developments , since this news release , it has been printed in the N.Y. Times , and one of the Washington Post issues , there is HIGHEST LEVEL TREASON by several F.B. I.  Agents in conjunction via N.C.I.C data bank use by "Tony-Pacific" , a former Series Seven Broker who has been convicted ,  and barred from ever operating in the "Market" again.  Why did several F.B.I. 
Agents let him have access to their Agency computers and "Top-Secret " files ? A combination of reasons will probably be admitted to.There are apparent ties to this , already linked in fact , in the Federal Court in San Diego.
THIS subject is so serious , I implore both of y'all to learn of the Corporate devastation imposed on Seaview Technologies by this Al- Qada supporter.

ASSOCIATED PRESS 

May 24, 2002 


SAN DIEGO – An Egyptian-born financial analyst charged in a nationwide stock swindle may have known about the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and tried to profit from them, a federal prosecutor said Friday. 



  <http://www.uniontrib.com/news/nation/terror/images/020524elgindy.jpg> 


Union-Tribune file
Amr "Tony" Elgindy 

Amr I. "Tony" Elgindy telephoned his broker on Sept. 10 and asked him to liquidate his children's $300,000 trust account, Assistant U.S. Attorney Ken Breen told a federal judge at Elgindy's detention hearing. 

"He made a comment predicting the market would drop to 3,000" at a time when the Dow Jones stock index was at 9,600, Breen said. "Perhaps Mr. Elgindy had pre-knowledge of the Sept. 11 attacks. Instead of trying to report it, he tried to profit from it." 


Elgindy, 34, of Encinitas, was ordered held without bond on charges of racketeering, extortion and obstruction of justice. Before issuing the order, Magistrate Judge John Houston said he was going to "disregard" the suggestion that Elgindy had anything to do with the terror attacks.

Elgindy, wearing a tan jumpsuit, did not speak during the hourlong hearing. 


His attorney, Jeanne Knight, said Elgindy did call his broker to make a trade, but the timing was coincidental and the market had been dropping for months. 


"It seems like the government, for lack of factual evidence, has decided to smear my client with terrorist innuendoes," Knight said. "This is smacking of racial profiling." 


Breen made his accusations as prosecutors tried to convince Houston that Elgindy was a flight risk and should be denied bail. 


Elgindy, one of five defendants in the case, was arrested May 22 on an indictment issued by a grand jury in Brooklyn, N.Y. 


In exchange for money, two FBI agents used confidential databases to provide Elgindy and other coconspirators with information on publicly traded companies, the indictment said. 


Elgindy allegedly spread negative information on the companies on his Web site and to subscribers of his e-mail newsletter, InsideTruth.com, while betting that the companies' stock would go down. 


In one case, a former FBI agent searched the agency's confidential National Crime Information Center database and discovered the criminal history of a top executive for a company called Nuclear Solutions, the indictment said. The same day, Elgindy began sending e-mails calling the executive "a convicted felon," then sold the company's stock short, the papers added. 


Earlier this week, FBI agents raided Elgindy's $2.2 million mansion. Inside, agents said they found tens of thousands of dollars in cash and gold coins. The government is seeking to seize his fleet of cars, which include a Rolls Royce, a Jaguar and a Humvee. 


If convicted of all counts, Elgindy faces a maximum 65 years in prison.

Dr. White, thank you for writing. We have asked teachers and many others in developing our strategy for improved reading. Our plan is based on providing assistance for teachers regarding the latest research and give them support. Your point concerning  control of the classroom is a good one. I am sick and tired of kids (and worse, parents!) who disrespect teachers as sport. I wish I could waive a magic wand and solve that problem but I am open to productive suggestions.

Subject: Education and reading


Governor:

After seeing a program that discussed the importance of reading which included both you mother and father, I was taken by your devotion to literacy. I retired from the USN in 1985 in Washington DC. I have a photograph in my den of both your father and President Regan saying best wishes on this important occasion in my life. I truly admire both men and what they accomplished for this nation.

After retiring from Florida as a Corrections Officer in Orange County, I tried teaching for about two years in Orange County, Florida. I finally resigned in disappointment for two reasons:  First, you cannot teach children who refuse to learn and second, you cannot teach children not withstanding how good you may be, unless  you can somehow maintain discipline in your classroom. Discipline that is quick, stern but also delivered in such a way as to have the child's best interest at heart.

Governor, I have had children refer to me in the most colorful terms possible. They used words in public that were unheard of thirty years ago. I have had my portable hit on so hard that pictures fell off the wall and deputies had to be called for assistance. I have heard mothers and fathers intimidate teachers in such a way as to actually make them fear for their lives. I have seen writing assignments in high school that belonged in the early years of middle school. If you complained the system saw to it that nothing got done.

I believe as you do that reading is fundamental to all of education. If you cannot read, then you are doomed to failure and ultimately will end up in the criminal justice system.

Governor, please allow me to offer you a suggestion.  Rather then implement different policies, ideas or concepts regarding the value of education from people who are preceived as experts, let's try something different. I believe that most answers to many of our social problems can be found from ordinary citizens who perform that kind of work. Stated differently, let's ask the teachers about their opinions, what's wrong and how to correct it. You might be surprised at what you hear.

I'm here to assist you if you are sincere...

Sincerely yours,



Dr. Charles J. White

I'm not sure if the tropical soda apple money in this year's budget was meant for public or private lands.  

The FDEP money is directed by s.201.15, FS, where 2.28% of documentary stamp taxes are earmarked for invasive plant control.  Up until the Florida Forever program passed, the aquatic and upland control dollars were appropriated by separate line items.  All dollars to be spent seem to be tied to public lands, only:

201.15  Distribution of taxes collected.--All taxes collected under this chapter shall be distributed as follows and shall be subject to the service charge imposed in s. 215.20 <http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=Ch0215/Sec20.htm> (1), except that such service charge shall not be levied against any portion of taxes pledged to debt service on bonds to the extent that the amount of the service charge is required to pay any amounts relating to the bonds: 

(6)  Two and twenty-eight hundredths percent of the remaining taxes collected under this chapter shall be paid into the State Treasury to the credit of the Aquatic Plant Control Trust Fund to carry out the purposes set forth in ss. 369.22 <http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=Ch0369/Sec22.htm>  and 369.252 <http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=Ch0369/Sec252.htm> .

Dear Governor Bush,

Derby Lane, owned by the St. Petersburg Kennel Club, Inc., has for years
been a generous donor to the University of South Florida St. Petersburg
through its return to charities programs.  The funds have helped
students and supported programs in many ways and it is now our
opportunity to seek your help to permit them to continue to contribute
to institutions like ours and many other charities I could name as
well.  I serve on the boards of many of the latter and know firsthand
the benefits each receives from Derby Lane and so I very respectively
ask for your support of CS/SB l60.  The Bill will grant authority to
conduct a special Greyhound "Adopt a Pet Day" to raise funds for the
promotion of greyhound adoption.  Greyhounds make fabulous pets and your
efforts to make them more adoptable will bring joy to many adults and
children throughout Florida.  The Bill includes other benefits for Derby
Lane which will help it generate even more dollars for the many
charities it now benefits in St. Petersburg and Pinellas County.

I thank you in advance for your support of CS/SB l60 and especially for
your continuing support of teachers and higher education.  We appreciate
and need this support.

Warmest best wishes,

Subject:	Funding DCF
Attachments:	Card for sdarcy

Dear Governor Bush,
Excise tax on retail beer, wine & liquor sales is not a popular idea,
particularly to the liquor/distributor lobby.  However, this type of
excise tax would assist in funding the needed funding for DC & F and the
upcoming recommendations and assist in maintaining funding services
under contract with the ADM office.
    By now, your eyes are probably rolling up into your head as anyone
mentions a tax creation in an election year.  I firmly believe that beer
should not competitively priced with soda.
     A lottery ticket named "Save the Kids" would be another magnificent
boost if the funds were allocated to DC & F.  Simply, all health and
human services programs rise and fall with revenues; we need to
stabilize that funding -- and THAT needs to be a platform issue.
    There is a significant amount of data from SAMHSA, CSAT and other
federally funded studies that reveals that nearly 90% of all alcohol
consumed is by just 10% of the population.  These are the persons whose
children go into foster care or at least DC & F supervision.
    My residential treatment agency, Community OutReach, in DeLand has
undergone a 10% decrease in contract funding that we simply cannot
afford and maintain services.  I need not tell you the staggering
numbers we have on the books for those who simply need an assessment,
let alone direct service.
   As always, I appreciate your fine work, your responsiveness to the
diverse needs of this state, and your commitment to substance abuse
services.

>On 25 May 2002 I had the honor and privilege to speak before your committee in Tampa and I appreciate that opportunity and I thank you for it.  On the record let me say that I applaud, as does so many, the Board of Medicine putting rules and regulations in place to clean up office surgery in Florida.  However, the B.O.M. over stepped its bounds when you placed the anesthesia rule into effect banning Nurse Anesthetist from continuing to provide safe quality anesthesia. Anesthesia was not the problem and did not need fixing. 
>
>  
>
>Dr. Leon, since you are not familiar with Nurse Anesthetist and their history, let me take a brief moment to tell you a little about us.  As you already know and have heard many times, we have provided safe quality anesthesia in hospitals, surgery centers, and offices for over 100 hundred years. Now stop and think about that, 100 years, if we did not practice safe quality anesthesia how could we ever survived that long.  If we did not provide safe quality anesthesia why has my malpractice insurance decreased in cost to me over the past 10 years.  What you are hearing Sir from the Anesthesiologist is all rhetoric to convince the B.O.M. to place such strong controls on office anesthesia that it will force the CRNA back into working for them or out of the state altogether.  As I stated before the committee, if it really were a Patient Safety issue that they were concerned about, then why were they fighting so hard and spending so much money to bring a lesser-trained anesthesia provider into Florida? 
>
>  
>Now, you have stated for the record that you did not want to hear economics brought into the meeting, so that was the way it was, however, let me assure you Sir, that is the whole agenda of the F.S.A. under the disguise of Patient Safety.  Lets take a minute and review the facts that are well known: 
>
>
>  
>	 * Reimbursements from Medicare and H.M.O. etc. have dropped. Medicare use to reimburse Anesthesiologist 1.5 times the allowable for each CRNA an Anesthesiologist supervised and I use the term supervise loosely, usually only on paper.  So if one Anesthesiologist directed 5 Nurse Anesthetist it was good money.  However, HCFA realized that Nurse Anesthetists were capable, well trained and did not need supervision and now reimburse the Anesthesiologist the same as a CRNA and they can no longer bill 1.5 times the allowable for supervision.  
>
>  
>	 * As HMO, PPO and other insurance groups came into being in the 80s reimbursements once again dropped and the Anesthesiologist found they had to do more cases in order to maintain their incomes and standards of living. So they began to find creative ways of doing that, one of which was to form a subgroup of doctors called Intensivist which take care of critically ill patients in the ICU, while yet others branched off into pain management.  
>
>  
>	 * As the anesthesiologist started taking on the other jobs they began to hire Nurse Anesthetist to do the cases in the operating rooms, taking them from hospitals, who employed Nurse Anesthetist directly to run their Operating Rooms. The hospitals now losing their anesthetist to the anesthesiologist groups had no choice but to contract with the anesthesiologist groups to provide that service, once again increasing the Anesthesiologist income.>  
>
>  
>	 * >Still looking for more ways to increase or maintain incomes Anesthesiologist began looking for other ways to make money. If you look at the A.S.A. web page you can find committee reports that discuss Office Based Anesthesia as being an untapped resource with recommendations to pursue that arena.  However, now for the first time Anesthesiologist fined that they are now in direct competition with nurse anes>thetist who developed office anesthesia into a fine art.  Nurse Anesthetist had been doing anesthesia in offices for 75 years.  The Anesthesiologist also come to realize how lucrative it is in that the patients pay you 100% of your fee and you dont have the expense or paper work of billing.  
>
>  
>	 * When the BOM began looking at the issues with office surgery here in Florida they found that it was in need of fixing from a surgical standpoint, yes, I expect that anesthesia could use some fine-tuning as well. The moratorium was put into place and those offices that had been doing it right complied with all the rules. I personally bought all the resuscitative drugs that the B.O.M. required including Dantrolene, alone that is a two thousand dollar investment. I personally have invested $40,000.00 in drugs and equipment to make sure that both of the offices I did anesthesia in met or exceeded the B.O.M. requirements. When the ban was lifted things improved, with Nurse Anesthetist still doing what they do best, and have years of training and experience doing. I personally do 1,500 plus-cases a year in offices and hospitals.  
>
>  
>	 * Now with the B.O.M. looking into and setting guidelines to control and monitor office based surgery the Florida Society of Anesthesiologist saw an opportunity to take over the Office Based Anesthesia Business. They decided to go to the B.O.M. with lies, false and poorly done studies in an attempt to make what was happening in offices look like it was anesthesia related and that Nurse Anesthetist could not and should not be doing it with out them.  This way, they could have the B.O.M. be the bad guys and literally 
>	steal our practices from us.  That is what the B.O.M. did with this ruling, like a thief in the night you stole my practice and my $40,000.00 investment and gave it to the Anesthesiologist.  
>
>
>  
>	 * Dr. Leon, I should have known in my heart that the B.O.M. and the F.S.A. is a good old boys club and that you would side with the F.S.A. But, down deep inside my gut I kept thinking that with all the evidence showing Anesthesia was not the problem and that the studies were bogus and that Nurse Anesthetist were doing office anesthesia longer than anesthesiologist and doing it well, or once again we would have never lasted in offices for 75 years, that honesty and integrity would prevail and the B.O.M. and particularly your committee would have done the right thing and reversed the level three rule back to what it was prior to April 15, 2002.  
>
>  
>	 * Now as for your suggestion for indirect supervision, which is a noble idea, but it will never work.  Why should the F.S.A. go to indirect supervision when you have already given them full supervision, meaning that I cant work without them being present, that is exactly what they wanted.  And, if they must be present and the surgeon has only one or two cases, then what do they need me for?  Also, why should I have to pay or share my fee with an Anesthesiologist for doing nothing except saying that he is supervising. If a Nurse Anesthetist gets into trouble he cant wait for the anesthesiologist to come from across town or his office to give him help.  
>	>Besides, a Nurse Anesthetist is trained to respond to any emergency that arises. Do you think that for a moment that millions of anesthetics given in the United States are all supervised by anesthesiologist, who somehow saves the patient from life threatening problems in the O.R., I hope not.  Nurse Anesthetist are saving lives day in and day out and until now have never boasted or been recognized for it. We have just gone about our work and careers doing what we are trained to do. It is well known that Nurse Anesthetists provide more than 65% of the anesthetics in the United States and a large percentage of those are Nurse Anesthetists working alone or with other Nurse Anesthetist.

>Now last but not least lets look at the safety record of Anesthesiologist. I personally know of two deaths in the last year that were cause directly by Board Certified Anesthesiologist. The first was from Dr. Tom Andrews, President Elect of the F.S.A., own group.  One of the Anesthesiologist decided to put a central line in his anesthetized patient and in the process traumatized the vessel and failed to recognize the problem until the patient cardiac arrested from hemorrhaging. The patient could not be resuscitated as I recall and died on the table.  The second case was just last month when two Board Certified Anesthesiologists failed to properly monitor a healthy 60-year-old male undergoing routine shoulder arthroscopy.  The patients temperature was not monitored during the case by the first anesthesiologist and the second anesthesiologist came to relieve him failed to monitor that modality as well. On emergence the patient was so hypothermic that he went into ventricular fibrillation and after approximately one hour was revived but suffered irreversible brain damage and died in the ICU a couple of days later.  But, since we live in an imperfect world I guess if you are a board certified anesthesiologist with MD behind your name such malpractice is OK however if this happened to a Nurse Anesthetist everyone says we should be supervised or Crucified and license revoked.  It is a sad day when one group uses it power to convince their colleagues, who have legislative authority, to use that authority to take away another groups right to practice under the laws of the state and thereby stealing their businesses and their ability to provide for their families.  That Sir is exactly what the A.S.A. and the B.O.M have done.

Dear Governor Bush,

Our daughter is a Music Teacher in Osceola County.  I am, therefore, aware of the shortage of educational dollars for our Schools (which I personally think is a terrible shame on all of us).

Please vote for more monies for our Schools.  We cannot educate all these wonderful young minds with Disney Movies and keep-busy play.

Thank you.

Dear Gov. Bush,  

I am the Guidance Secretary at St. Cloud Middle School in the School
District of Osceola County.  I am also a Florida native.   I see every day
the overcrowding in the classrooms.  How many students were in your
classes when you were in school?  20?, 25?  Try 30 or 38 now.   And that
amount is only going to get bigger.  I understand that there is the
possibility of Osceola County School District receiving 8.5 million
dollars from the state legislature to help our fast growing county. 
(Section 28 page 416)  Please do not veto this item.  

Osceola County has had the fastest growing school system in the state for
the past five years, and is projected to have the fastest growing school
system for the next five years.  We have received the lowest amount, per
capita, for school construction in the state for the past five years. 
Osceola County has one of the highest percentages of students in charter
schools in the State.  We are the only county in the state that has
exhausted all local sources for school construction.

Your record so far in the area of education for Florida schools has not
been what I would call "exemplary".  Please let this item pass in the
budget.  It may be your saving grace for the next election.  I know it
would help me see you in a different light.  

Sincerely, 
Dolores Walker

Importance:	High

Recipients Suppressed 
 
Dear Board of County Commissioners, 
 
We didn't pay too much attention when the subject of two particular books were being discussed which you've approved for placement in our public library. We apologize for our distraction.  
 
Although we have not read the books, i.e., "It's Perfectly Normal" and "Deal With It," we heard descriptive statements and revelations of actual drawings from these books on a recent broadcast of the John Lund Show on WOCA 1370 Radio Talk Show. 
 
We commend John and WOCA for telling it like it is and wish this information had been available earlier to the Citizens of Marion county. 
 
If these books were sold in a retail outlet without a cover and not kept behind the counter they'd violate current statutory mandates of protecting under age buyers from accessibility to pornographic material. These books are outrageously graphic and should not be available to our children.
 
If you haven't read these books and viewed the drawings we urge you to do so and place this issue on a future agenda for a public hearing.
 
We understand our county attorney advised commissioners; failure to approve access would lead to a lawsuit in violation of freedom of speech and/or press. We're certain he has advised commissioner's similarly on other issues which the board ignored but the final decision is the perogative of the board. 
 
If the board can expend funds to engage outside legal services for a myriad of issues why was it reluctant to challenge these books? Can you provide the justification for, seemingly, contributing to the moral decay of our children in Marion county?  
 
We understand we are 'Bob & Geri come lately' but we believe; if the general public knew what John told us last week they'd be willing to challenge access. Marion county can and should set the precedent in Florida which will surely have repurcussion's in our nation. We suggest you do so as expeditiously as possible. 
 
Incidentally, we've learned but don't have the name of a similar book being considered for access to children by the library advisory board. 
 
The time has come to stop this nonsense! 
 
Thank you for your consideration in this matter. We look forward to your reply.

Governor Bush:

Thank you very much for the new programs and the support that you have given to Education.  Indeed you are the "Education Governor".  As a Republican and your supporter, I firmly believe that you are doing a great job.  

Today, I write to you because the children of Osceola County need your help.  Please grant $10 million to help the fast growing counties. As a resident of Osceola county, I honestly can tell you that we are in desperate need of the $8.5 millions that we would receive of these funds. These funds will be dedicated to build new schools.

Our county, Osceola,is the fastest growing county in the state of Florida  The projections are, that we will continue being the fastest growing for the next five years. In contrast, Osceola county has received the lowest amount, percapita, for school construction in the state for the past five years.  Please do not veto the these critical funds that will help the fastest growing counties in Florida.

Osceola County has exhausted all other local resources for school contruction. The truth is that we need to put more funds into schools for our children. They are the future of our county and the future of this nation.  We are in need of additional resources to educate them.

Please, do not hesitate to contact me if you have any comments or questions about this request.  I work for Valencia Community College, Osceola Campus and I believe that Education is the key to the future of this county and of our nation.  I also firmly believe in providing our students with a K through 20 program, with seamless transitions.

For context, the State is always trying to do better and needs to do better,
but the total overhead - people, paper, buildings, etc...for FL DOE is less

billion for fiscal 2002-2003



     Brewser,
          Marie Dinon is on the board of directors of IVBE, she wrote the post which you responded to. I appreciate what she's stated, that being that much of the education dollars support the top level administration. However, I do recognize what you've written (above) and appreciate the information. If any administration has worked diligently to reduce overhead at the top it has been Jeb's. I have spent much time defending him, and his education efforts over the years.
          I do worry about the upcoming election. I don't think I could stand it if Jeb did not win re-election. I think I'd feel inclined to give up on the whole education reform movement...the Republican ed-reform movement that is.
          My goal is to continue to seek de-centralization of education across the board. So much waste occurs in the districts themselves, yet they often hold the cards when it comes to what information reaches the public.
         I don't blame stagnant FCAT scores on the Bush administration and the recent financial problems of the state. I blame teachers who have focused more on the socialization of kids rather than the academic instruction of them. So many are under-trained, some lazy, with the philosophy that children are self-directed learners. Well, maybe some are but the majority are not!
         The curriculum is still woefully inadequate in many ways. Classrooms are rife with actvities and copious "projects" that have little learning value. Sorry to sound so redundant, but the STW philosophy has denegrated classroom instruction over the years.
          Many schools and teachers have basically tried to "employ" without pay parents to check homework, grade tests, in the schools. Now I appreciate parental participation and the need for it, but teachers are not aware of a child's shortcomings if another person is checking their work. In Brevard, students in middle school have been commissioned to enter grades into a computer database. Does this sound wise? It turned out that the teacher decided that getting help in her work was more important than finding some academic exercise for the students to do.
       Anyway, IVBE will be supporting Jeb to the maximum degree. He is still our only chance to force a money hungry ed-system into accountability.
        God Bless You,
                Shelley Nelson

Disappointed models sue agency
a 28 News report 4/29/02
related story:  <http://www.28news.com/stories/020215model2000.shtml> Modeling agency accused of making false promises (2/15/02) 


  <mhtml:mid://00000183/!http://www.tampabaylive.com/images/stories/0429model3.jpg> TAMPA - Dozens of angry would-be models claim their agency ripped them off, and Monday they took their fight to court. 


This modeling agency has been in the spotlight since a 28 Investigates report back in February. Tampa police, the Department of Professional Regulation and even the governor's office started investigating. But one of the victims didn't want to wait for results, so her family is suing Model 2000. 


Christy West lost her dream of hitting the big time as a model, but she hopes to win in court. Her parents spent $855 to start Christy's modeling career, but all they got were photographs- no modeling jobs. 


"She continued to tell me how beautiful Christy was. And that she was exactly what they were looking for and she guaranteed I would make that money back in no time," testified Christy's mother. 


"Yeah she got me all excited. She told me about all these jobs. She promised me," testified Christy. 


  <mhtml:mid://00000183/!http://www.tampabaylive.com/images/stories/0429model.jpg> Nancy Sniffen, right, owns Model 2000. Through her lawyer, she denied the allegations. 


"Well, it's just incorrect. It's false. She is selling photographs, but lots and lots of people get jobs." 


The victims in this case say it's not about the money. They want to win to try and put Model 2000 out of business. It turns out dozens of customers complained about the same treatment. 


28 Investigates paid the owner a second visit after the state joined the investigation. Sniffen refused to talk, but now she has to answer to a judge. 


The victims feel Model 2000 is a photo mill, that the owner makes money by selling them pictures but never gets them modeling jobs. The owner's attorney admits she does make money that way, but claims she makes more money placing people in modeling jobs. 


Sniffen will testify when the trial continues later this week.

PATRIOTISM: Bad timing 
Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura used incredibly poor judgment in discussing 
legislation that would have required public school students to recite 
the Pledge of Allegiance at least once a week. 
The bill had little meaning other than expressing post-Sept. 11 
patriotism, because it allowed school boards to opt out. 
Nevertheless, Ventura vetoed it, saying patriotism should be voluntary. 
Unfortunately, he also said a pledge requirement would be 
indoctrination, similar to Nazi Germany telling youths to hail the Third 
Reich, or the Taliban in- structing Afghan children to chant 
anti-American slogans. 
It isn't the same. The pledge is a positive message to support freedom, 
not an indoctrination to hate others. Ventura's timing couldn't have 
been worse, with new reports surfacing daily of fresh attacks on the 
United States being planned by enemies of this nation. 
Ventura's proclivity toward outrageous speech may have been endearing 
during his days as a "bad guy" professional wrestling announcer, but 
they are out of place as the chief executive of a state.

Subject:	Tuition Veto Information

Dear Alan,
Hello. I promised I would get back with you on some additional data relating 
to tuition in Florida.

The main premise surrounding this issue (has been and always will be) - what 
does tuition cost in Florida relative to other states? Well, that has been 
the problem. Policy-makers have been receiving inaccurate information about 
Florida’s ranking on tuition and fees relative to other states for over 20 
years. The Division of Colleges and Universities has reported that Florida 
is 48 out of 50 nationwide for in-state post-secondary public undergraduate 
tuition and fees, citing the Washington State Higher Education Board 
National Comparison Survey on Tuition and Fees.

This survey does report Florida as 48th; however, the survey only takes into 
account six of the State University System institutions. A further analysis 
(by FSA staff) shows that Washington only provided a comprehensive analysis 
on tuition and fees for four out of the 50 states. In fact, the Washington 
survey only reviewed 264 of the 610 four-year public post-secondary colleges 
and universities, or 43 percent. Washington officials have stated that their 
survey has not taken into account any new public universities entering the 
mix over the past 30 years and that the original universities were chosen 
for their likeness to state of Washington institutions, not as a national 
indicator.  This survey and its information is useless to Governor Bush!

Now the question is, does the Governor want to use this flawed data to 
decide tuition policy in Florida? Does he want to listen to the university 
presidents when they say, Florida's tuition is cheap relative to the other 
states. I highly doubt it, because the university presidents are using the 
Washington Report, which is ripe with errors and omissions.

The Florida Board of Education recently created a Task Force to deliberate 
on Florida's tuition policy, the Bright Futures Program, the Florida Prepaid 
Program and the overall financing of higher education in Florida. Why was 
the Legislature so quick to give this power to the trustees prior to the 
FBOE having an opportunity to receive recommendations from the Task Force? 
Why are the policy-makers not waiting for Secretary Horne's recommendations?

This is a huge policy change for the state of Florida - providing appointed 
officials with control over tuition. Shouldn't the state conduct a 
comprehensive analysis prior to making this policy change?

If the Governor approves the 10 to 20 percent tuition increase, he will be 
making that decision based on the premise that Florida is cheap (48 out of 
50) relative to other states. The Washington Report and its data is 
incomplete and I can say with much confidence that the Governor will be 
making a mistake for a large majority of Florida's college students and 
parents.

Thank you for letting me share this additional information. I hope all is 
well.

With Warm Regards,

Subject:	Help for Osceola County School Construction

Dear Governor Bush:

I know that you are currently reviewing the budget for next year which 
includes a $10MM appropriation for school construction in the fastest growing 
school districts in the state.  Of that $10MM, $8.5MM is for school 
construction here in Osceola County.  I also know that you are aware that 
Osceola County is the fastest growing school district in the state and it is 
predicted we will continue with this dubious distinction for at least the 
next five years.  Our growth is so huge we need to add a classroom a day for 
every day of the school year just to stay even -- much less reduce class size 
-- and we are way behind in making that happen.

I would therefore ask you to please approve the $10MM and therefore the 
$8.5MM that would go to Osceola County.  Though it will not build one whole 
school, it will go a long way to help build one, and we need all the help we 
can get.  The need is tremendous and we have exhausted all local sources of 
construction funding.  Your attention to this matter, as the "Education 
Governor" would be greatly appreciated.

Mr. Bush,  
 
I am a teacher in Osceola County.  I urge you to approve additional funding for Osceola County's incredible growth.  The Osceola County school system has been the fastest growing district in the state for the past five years.  Every time I make my daily trek to work, I am amazed at the new growth and development along the way.  In the past four years, my drive time to work has nearly doubled because of the increased construction and traffic.  
 
Even though we are growing at a tremendous rate, Osceola County has received the lowest amount, per capita, for school construction in the state for the past five years.  We also have one of the highest percentages of students in charter schools in the state.  Our county has exhausted local sources for school construction:  levying a full 2 mills, sharing in the Local Option Sales Tax, levying the highest School Impact Fees in the state, levying additional mills for a School Construction Bond issue, establishing seven charter schools, using all effort index dollars, and using all classroom first dollars.  
 
I urge you to stand behind your promises of educational improvement and provide the extra funding necessary to educate the children in our fastest growing districts. 
 
Thank you.

Subject:	Greyhound adoption

Dear Governor Bush,

I recently wrote to you about my support for the greyhound adoption 
bill on your desk. I am enclosing a copy of a story I am running this 
Friday on greyhound adoption. It is written in the first person (or 
greyhound) as my greyhound Dottie would have written it.
Everything in the story is true and factua.
I hope you find it insightful.

Best regards,

It’s a wonderful greyhound life

By Dottie the Greyhound
As told to her human Steve Zimmerman

I just love when today comes each year. For today is my birthday. My 
name is Dottie and I turned 10 years old today.
Now you might be asking yourself how a greyhound would know it is 
her birthday. I know because of the cake and ice cream I had today. Every 
year on the same day for the past six years since I came to live with my 
humans, I have gotten cake and ice cream. And today was the day.
The funny thing is, I turned 10 (that is 70 in dog years) but these two 
humans still talk to me like I was a puppy down on the farm. Oh well, you 
know what they say. A human is only as smart as his greyhound lets them 
be.
When I raced, my human, Steve, watched me every time. He watched 
me run into the six dog one time and then run into the four dog the next 
time. Needless to say, I was not the best racer. My late sister Genie was the 
runner in this family.
When I came into the human’s home, she was already there and was 
queen of the house. Or sometimes she was the evil stepsister to my 
Cinderella. She was a strange dog. She had to be fed first and always had to 
be the first to choose where she would sleep for the night.
She usually got to sleep with the female human Sharon in her bed, 
which relegated her male human Steve to another bed in the house. That 
meant I had the choice of either the couch or the loveseat. And as I am 
kind of tall for a girl, I usually chose the couch.
But I do have to give Genie some credit. She was totally responsible for 
me coming to live with the humans.
She was an only dog and she wanted some company. So when the 
humans would go to work, Genie would take all the canned foods off the 
shelves and stack them in the living room and sleep with them.
That made the humans think that she needed a companion. So when I 
ran into the three dog during a race and hurt my leg, I got to go home with 
Steve and Sharon. Boy, was I lucky.
I came into a house where the humans were already greyhound trained. 
They knew that if they were on the couch and Genie or I wanted to get on 
there to sleep, they had to move. All we have to do is give them the evil eye 
and they get up and move.
I must admit though that I am not as worldly as Genie was and that got 
me into a couple of strange situations.
Like the time I accidentally walked into the bedroom while Steve was 
trying to make Sharon taller (as if she wasn’t tall enough already!). She 
was sitting on him and on first glance; I thought this looked very 
interesting. So I rested my head on the end of the bed and waited to see 
how tall Sharon would get.
Well, Steve happened to look down and see me with my head resting on 
the foot of the bed staring at them and he started to laugh, which caused 
Sharon to laugh and fall off him. I was not sure what was so funny and 
soon tired of being laughed at so I turned and left the room.
But I got my revenge. Steve had bought a big bag of these little 
triangular candies they called kisses. Well, he left them on the counter in 
the kitchen when they went out and I decided to taste them.
I took the bag off the counter and took each kiss from its wrapper and 
ate every last one of them. Even though Genie was there with me in the 
house, that’s my story and I’m sticking to it.
When my humans came home, they discovered the empty bag and the 
wrappers and became very concerned. I heard them call my doctor and 
ask him if I was okay.
They could have just asked me. Other than walking and talking a little 
faster, I felt great. When Steve got off the phone with my doctor, he told 
Sharon that if I wasn’t dead in an hour, I would be okay.
Dead, ha! That day was the only day I ever beat Genie in a race around 
our big back yard. On that day, I could have beat Secretariat in a race.
Well, things have been changing around the house lately. Genie, who 
was 14, went to sleep a few months ago. I knew something was wrong 
when she started to forget my name during our talks. Steve said she had 
doggie Alzheimer’s disease. My doctor told me, and the humans, that 
actually can happen in dogs.
When Genie left us, some great people showed up at our door 
unannounced and left a male greyhound named Mike for my other brother 
Caper and me.
Caper came to us a couple of years ago after being abused by a mean 
trainer in Massachusetts. That trainer beat Caper and his four brothers 
with a bullwhip. As they were very scared of humans, they did not race and 
could not be adopted so they had to be put to sleep.
Steve saw Caper in his new Florida kennel acting very scared and asked 
the trainer who had taken Caper from the mean trainer what was wrong. 
After hearing the story, he told the trainer to bring Caper to our house.
It took two years of leaving him alone to find his way to the humans. 
But now he is playing with us, walking the humans on their leash and 
acting like a real greyhound.
Lately, my leg has been hurting me real bad. So last week the humans 
took me to see my doctor Bruce. I don’t think he or the humans have 
figured out we greyhounds understand English. But we do.
I heard Doctor Bruce say I have cancer and they could take my leg to 
stop the disease from spreading. Now I don’t know about you, but I think a 
three-legged greyhound must look awfully funny.
Luckily, my humans said no and decided to bring me back home whole. 
When we got in the car, Steve was very upset about my being sick and was 
crying. But, in my own inimitable way, I cheered him up. I gave him a big 
slobbery kiss right on the lips.
My leg has been getting worse every day but I knew it was about time for 
that cake and ice cream so I wanted to stay around for one last taste.
Now that my birthday is over, I guess it is time for me to join Genie at 
the big racetrack in the sky. Before she left me, she told me that if there 
was lightning outside, that meant that she had won another race. I have 
been counting and Genie has won six times already. I hope I am better at 
racing this time around so I can light up the sky for Mike and Caper.
Well, I am going to go tell the humans it is time for me to make room 
for another deserving retired racer in their home. I hope they get another 
female so that Sharon has someone to take her side in a fight. Steve 
already has a big head and if they have three more males in the 
house...well you paint your own picture (can someone say Mr. Potato 
Head?).
But before I go, I need to tell them that they should not be sad for me. I 
have had a great life and can’t wait to swap stories of life as an adoptee 
with all the other former racers in doggie heaven. I bet they’ll all get a big 
hoot from my making Sharon taller story.
Greyhound adoption has been the greatest invention since the couch or 
loveseat (or maybe cake and ice cream). I can’t thank my trainers, Kirk 
and Julie, and my humans, Steve and Sharon, for giving me such a great 
opportunity to live a royal life.
People who adopt greyhounds are the best. So let me say in closing to 
everyone who has adopted or is about to adopt a fellow greyhound, thank 
you very much.
Greyhound adoption is a very easy and worthwhile endeavor. There are 
two greyhound adoption agencies in the area plus some trainers on the 
track do their own adoptions.
The Ebro Greyhound Park operates an adoption program on the track. 
And Jennifer Cullen operates Valentine Adoptions out of her home in 
Washington County.
The adoption process is very easy. All you need to do is contact the 
track or Cullen and an application can be sent or picked up. Once the 
application is completed and returned, and your references and home has 
been approved, you will be matched up with the perfect greyhound.
It is suggested you have a fenced in yard to give your greyhound room to 
exercise. With Cullen, it is a requirement while with the on track 
adoption, greyhounds can be adopted to those without a fence. You do not 
need a large security fence, as greyhounds as a rule do not jump. A cattle 
fence fully enclosed is acceptable.
Also, some greyhounds are compatible with cats or other animals. So if 
you already have another dog or a cat, that does not disqualify you from 
adopting a greyhound.
Cullen has her greyhound adoptees spayed or neutered, has all shots 
given and has the greyhound’s teeth cleaned before she completes the 
adoption process.
With Ebro’s adoption center, if the greyhound is not spayed or 
neutered, you must sign a form saying you will do so. And, if for any 
reason the adoption does not work out, the greyhound must be returned to 
Valentine Adoption Center or the track adoption center.
To adopt a greyhound, call Tammy Hess at the Ebro Greyhound Park 
at 234-3943 or Jennifer at Valentine Adoptions at 850-265-6667.
Note from Steve:
We did adopt a female greyhound, Coffee, after Dottie’s death. And 
after Caper suddenly died in 1998, we took in another female, Mimi, 
leaving Mike and myself a definite minority in the home.

Subject: Ichetucknee Cement Plant Delay


Gainesville Sun Article, May 25, 2002 by Sun Staff Writer, Ron Matus: 

 A State Agency Maintains that Suwannee American Cement has not Obeyed the Terms of a 1999 Settlement: 


    State environmental officials and the company building a cement plant near the Ichetucknee River are clashing again, this time over air pollution monitoring data the company agreed it would have before the plan t could open. 
    In an unusually blunt letter to the company Friday, the Department of Environmental Protection said without the data, company plans to operate the controversial plant are "in serious jeopardy." 
    Officials with Suwannee American Cement fear the latest dispute with DEP may delay the plant's opening as long as two years, with millions of dollars in lost sales. 
    "You're talking about a $100 million investment here," said company spokesman Jim McClellan. 
    At issue is a 1999 settlement agreement between Suwannee American and DEP. 
    The agency agreed to give the plant a permit--and reverse a decision to deny the permit five months earlier--in return for a list of concessions, including a company promise to provide more than two years" worth of background air pollution data before the plant starts burning coal to make cement. 
    The data would allow the state to compare pollution levels before and after the plant begins to operate. 
    Suwannee American says it hasn't been able to provide the data because two sophisticated pollution monitors it bought from an Atlanta company in 2000 turned out to be, in the words of Suwannee's consultant, "lemons." 
    "If we knew we were going to have the continuous problems...we would have gotten some other monitors," said John Koogler with Gainesville-based Koogler & Associates. 
    Koogler said he finally "got the bugs worked out" in March, which would give the company nine months' worth of data before the plant's anticipated opening early next year. 
    The company promised 27 months worth of data in the settlement. 
    In March, DEP fined Suwannee American $15,000 for not having the monitors up and running as promised. 
    On Friday, it issued an ominous warning. 
    "Because this data collection requirement is intended to provide important baseline air quality information before the plant becomes operational, your ability to bring the plant on line is in serious jeopardy," wrote DEP Deputy Secretary Allan Bedwell to plant manager Robert Sagmeister. 
    "While additional legal notices regarding this issue are forthcoming, do not make plans or have any expectations to test or operate the plant in question until this issue is resolved." 
    The letter's tone rattled company officials. 
    "This didn't just come out of left field," McClellan said. "This came out of the cheap seats." 
    Koogler called it "a Friday afternoon shocker." 
    McClellan said the company was trying to arrange a meeting with DEP as soon as possible to "find some reasonable solution." 
    "The question that needs to be asked is: Are we holding up this business and these jobs for legitimate scientific reasons," he said, "or is this an arbitrary time period?" 
    DEP Secretary David Struhs could not be reached for comment Friday afternoon. 
    Other DEP officials who were reached said they could not comment or were not familiar with Bedwell's letter. 
        The flare-up is the latest round in a 3 and one half year battle between DEP and Suwannee American, an affiliate of Lake City road builder Anderson Columbia Inc. 
    In June 1999, DEP stunned environmentalists by denying a permit, saying the company could not provide "reasonable assurance" it would operate the plant safely because of Anderson Columbia's long list of environmental violations. It was the first time DEP had denied a permit on those grounds. 
    But the settlement agreement was announced five months later. Now the plant is under construction off U.S. 27 in Suwannee County, 3 miles west of the Ichetucknee River and 40 miles north of Gainesville. 
    It will burn 100,000 tons of coal and used tires each year and employ 80 people. 
    The monitors required in the settlement measure particulates, dust-like pollutants that can cause lung problems if inhaled. 
    Koogler said the monitors collected data while they were on the fritz, just not as much as DEP requires. There is still enough information for the agency to know what typical background levels are for particulates in that area, he said. 
    Getting data over a longer period of time will allow DEP to see the ups and downs in pollution levels during different seasons, when winds, rain and other weather conditions come into play. 
    The latest development surprised both critics and supporters. 
    But Tallahassee activist Linda Young, a leading opponent of the plant, remained skeptical about DEP's intentions. 
    "Don't believe it for a second," she said about the agency's new attitude. 
    If DEP intended to enforce the settlement agreement, it would have jumped on the company just a few months after it was signed, when Anderson Columbia was being cited for environmental violations on a road project in the Panhandle. 
    The dispute in that case remains unresolved and likely to head to court. 
    The Friday letter is "posturing and bluffing and boob-dazzling the public," she said. "When the rubber hits the road, they're going to cave to political pressure." 
    At least one Suwannee County commissioner who strongly supported the plant gave DEP a thumbs up. 
    "I'd have a problem if DEP allowed a company to open without meeting the agreement," said Commissioner Doug Udell. As for the jobs, "You can't miss what you don't have," he said

Governor,
 
The Florida Board of Education is advertising for the chancellor positions for the universities, and community colleges offices under the secretary of education.
 
Secretary Horne has informed me that he has nominated me for the chancellor of community colleges position, and I plan to apply by the June 7 deadline.
 
I would greatly appreciate your support as a reference for me in this process if you are comfortable doing so. 
 
If you are ok with this, it would mean that I would list you as one of five references in my application and you might be contacted by the search firm at some point in the process.
 
The search firm will recommend three names to the screening committee, which is Sec. Horne, Chairman Handy, Lt. Gov. Brogan, Roberto Martinez, Gwen Stephenson (president at Hillsborough C.C.) and an outside the state community college professor. The screening committee and Sec.

Division of Community Colleges. The successful candidate must possess

significant demonstrated and proven effective leadership experience;

preferably with education institutions or a high level position in an

education related organization. Applicants must have distinguished

themselves in higher education policy, administration or management. 

Master's degree required; doctorate or other terminal degree preferred. 

 

For best consideration application materials should be received prior to

June 7, 2002. Review of applications will begin immediately and continue

until an appointment is made. Application materials should include a

letter addressing how the candidates' experiences match the position

requirements, a curriculum vita, and the names, title, email and business

addresses, business and home telephone numbers of at least five references,

which include faculty, administrators, and community leaders. Submission

of materials as an MS Word attachment is strongly encouraged. Individuals

wishing to nominate candidates for the position should submit a letter of

Dear Governor Bush,

For the past five years, Osceola has been the fastest growing county in
Florida.  During the next five years, we're again projected to be the
fastest growing county.  I'm writing to ask you to not veto the money that
the legislature has approved to help us cope with this uncontrollable
growth of one classroom a day. 

*Osceola County has received the lowest amount, per capita, for school
construction in the state for the past five years.

*Osceola County has one of the highest percentages of students in charter
schools in the State.

* Osceola County is the only County in the state that has exhausted all
local sources for school construction:
- Levying a full 2 mills
- Sharing in the Local Option Sales Tax
- Levying the highest School Impact Fees in the State
- Levying additional mills for a School Construction Bond Issue
- Established seven charter schools
- Using all effort index dollars
- Using all classroom 1st dollars

This money would be a tremendous help in ensuring the best education that
we can give to our students.  Please don't veto this much needed funding.

Thank you!

Subject: Steve's BIG BULLET POINTS ON GROWTH MANAGEMENT
Dear Governor,

As promised, here are some "big picture" thoughts on the gm bill....based on speeches given during the last few weeks.

1.  Most significant reform of growth management since the law's enactment in 1985.

2.  Remarkable consensus built to support the bill.  Unanimous vote in House, nearly so in Senate.  Democrat and Republican supported this bill, as did the Florida Homebuilders and 1000 Friends of Florida, the Florida Chapter of the American Planning Association and the Community Developers, the Save the Manatee Club and the Florida Agricultural Coalition, the League of Cities and the Association of Counties.  Unusual coalition for such a contraversial subject.

3.  Many good ideas in bill (it is 156 pages long), but most important elements are better school planning and better water planning...

     a. We have about 18 months for every school board, county commission and city in Florida to enter into an Interlocal Agreement.  The Agreement must address where schools are planned to be built and where they are planned to be closed, what infrastructure will be needed to serve the schools, where the community's growth is planned to occur and how these local governments will resolve their disputes.  Exactly how school boards and local governments address these issues is not mandated; the requirement that they enter into an enforcable agreement is. (Legislature funded $550,000 to DCA to implement these plans; Governor had asked for $3 million, but its good to actually fund a planning initiative)

     b. In like fashion, cities and counties must work with Water Management Districts to better plan for their water supply.  Local governments must integrate the WMDs' Regional Water Supply Plans into their comprehensive plans and must develop a 10 year workplan for building enough water supply to serve current citizens and projected population growth.

4.  The bill contains provisions which,
-reduce bureaucracy
-contemplate new funding sources for school construction
-broaden a citizen's right to contest a land use decision
-strengthen manatee and natural resource protection through "boating facility siting plans"
-and calls for a better analysis of annexations and local government service delivery.

5.  The bill is a significant step forward; true reform, however, will be determined by commitment of local leaders to these planning initiatives...

6.  Certain legislators truly helpful:
-Sen. Constantine understands the subject matter and guided the bill, from the beginning, through the Senate
-Senators Lee and Pruitt very helpful in giving advice in how to deal with Senate
-Rep. Murman filed the "school planning bill" in the House and was a solid supporter throughout the process
-Rep. Carassas filed the other portions of the bill and held off unfriendly amendments; he's a city attorney by trade, so is knowledgable about the issues
-Rep. Bennett was a consistent supporter and spoke for the bill on the floor...he also agreed to hold off unfriendly amendments
-Rep. Atkinson added the "educational facilities benefit districts" section and spoke for the bill on the floor
-Rep. Henriquez was consulted regularly (he's a planner by trade) and he urged Democrats to support the bill on the floor

...once we know who will be attending the bill signing(s), we will provide additional details.

Governor, for your consideration...I did not go through the proper PIO channels with this email.  It supplements the very detailed information you will receive from others.  You're the man-see you Friday.

Subject:	Re: Request for weather shelter on State property.


I am writing in response to your e-mail on 5-20-02 which you had sent to
the St. Johns River Water Management District (District) webmaster.  The
District had removed the "camp house" and the pole shed and other
structures on the property because they were deemed unsafe.  The "camp"
also served as source of illegal activity, including vandalism, dumping,
and serving as a party spot.  In the past folks have gained access to site
by cutting our fence and entering illegally with a motorized vehicle.  The
Orange County Sheriff's Department, in their attempt to assist the District
and Orange County Parks and Recreation (County) with management of the
property, suggested that the buildings be removed.  We also had removed
these strucures in preparation for the County to implement the "Long Branch
Park" resource management plan.  County efforts are being refocused so
plans for this area are currently on hold.

At this time I am unable to construct a pole barn or other buildings on the
Long Branch parcel until management guidelines for the property are agreed
upon by the District and the County.

Dear Sir or Madame,
Greetings on behalf of the Bithlo Citizens Advisory  Council, Chairman,
Cory E. Goodman.

I am writing to request permission to erect a  weather shelter on the
public land which was purchased by your agency several  years ago.
I was provided permission to access the property  from Doug Voltolina while
he was in charge of the parcel located south of Bithlo  on the Econ river.
At the time,several buildings were on the property  which served as weather
shelters for our residents.
Shortly after Doug was promoted to Brevard county  the buildings were
demolished, even though Pete Henn promised that a pole barn  would remain
to serve as a shelter. Not only was the pole barn destroyed, but in
addition, a horse stable, log cabin and tool shed were destroyed for no
apparent  reason. Leaving the children and other residents of our community
without any  shelter on the property.

Although I do not understand or agree with the  demolition of the
buildings, I am writing to inquire what process our community  would have
to follow to erect a new shelter, at no cost to the taxpayers, for  our
children to use in the storms that are sure to come this  summer.
I myself was caught in a storm a few weeks ago and  ruined a very expensive
saddle, due to not having a shelter from the  storm.
Again, I will provide the labor and material to  erect a small pole barn
type shelter, similar to those on the St. Johns River,  which are used by
the public in foul weather, with your permission.

I thank you in advance for any advice and guidance  you may provide in this
matter.

Respectfully yours,

Bithlo Citizens Advisory Council

Governor:
 
See the email below. This is NOT GOOD for Florida.  This is indicative of the amount of work that we do not get/have, and the Florida's DGA (Director's Guild of America) membership has dropped off.  This is the first time this has happened to Florida.  We are simply being out-competed for business.
 
I have a call in to the DGA office to try to get this thing reversed in some way.

Memo to:  Florida Filmmakers & friends
From:         Rick Pamplin
RE:            DGA Production Centers

I received a letter from the Directors Guild of America (DGA) today informing me of the following:

The DGA is revising areas currently designated as production centers.

Effective July 1, 2002, the following area will no longer be considered production centers:

                                     1. Dallas, TX
                                     2. Boston, MA
                                     3. Miami, FL
                                     4. Orlando, FL
                                     5. Atlanta, GA

The DGA production centers effective July 1, 2002 will be:

                                     1. Los Angeles, CA
                                     2. Chicago, IL
                                     3. San Francisco, CA
                                     4. New York, NY
                                     5. Wilmington, NC
                                     6. Vancouver, BC Canada
                                     7. Toronto, ON Canada                                     

All Florida DGA members must pick one of the above seven production centers as their new "local employment address."

Thought you would be interested.

It would appear that Steve Roberts has second and third hand information
that he brought to the attention of SA John Smith of the Sebring RA.  SA
Smith indicates he attempted ascertain what criminal activity was being
reported by Roberts.  When Roberts was unable to identify criminal activity
the conversation was concluded.  Roberts was apparently upset that no
investigation would be pursued.  SAS John King describes Roberts as local
republican leader who is prone to call and provide information.
 
In retrospect this information should have been forwarded to Don Ladner for
a threat assessment.  Don has been in contact with SAS King and DeSoto
County Sheriff John Fugate regarding this issue.  Don has opened a
preliminary threat assessment inquiry regarding Roberts information.
Sebring FDLE will be interviewing those persons whom Roberts got his
information and will ultimately interview Plackard who is identified by
Roberts as a suspicious person.

Subject:	Social Norms - USA TODAY

In case you missed today's USA TODAY I wanted to forward today's USA TODAY
piece on Social Norms Marketing.  This approach continues to be an important
and effective approach being used to address college drinking issues. 

The kids are all right 'Social norming' may be the strategy to keep them
that way 
By Karen Thomas
USA TODAY 
Are kids really that bad? 
Nine out of every 10 college students have never damaged property because
they were drunk or high. Three out of four have never blown an exam or
school project because of drugs or alcohol. Ninety-nine percent of students
who drink do not have unwanted sex. 
Most kids don't go out and get trashed every night. 
Each year, more students choose to abstain from alcohol. Fewer choose to
smoke and do drugs. 
Death by alcohol-related accidents or suicide is rare. 
The widespread impression that the norm for today's young people is drunken
debauchery simply isn't true. Most kids are OK. It's the best-kept secret on
college campuses, and a growing number of experts believe that keeping all
this good news quiet is doing far more harm than good. 
Parents are often the most unaware, and they fear the worst when they send
kids off to college, says Michael Haines, a substance-abuse expert at
Northern Illinois University in DeKalb. Students today take very seriously
the risks of drinking, he says, ''yet parents are being sold a bill of
goods, with kids portrayed in number-crunching stories as drunken, reckless,
careless boozers.'' 
Haines is the father of a grassroots movement among prevention educators
called ''social norming,'' and it's gaining fast favor on college campuses.
The premise is quite simple, but completely at odds with today's accepted
practice of scaring teens away from risky behaviors. 
Social norming operates on this notion: If the general impression is that
most kids don't drink alcohol, then those who do drink will drink less, and
fewer will start drinking in the first place. The key is to not over-report
the incidences of dangerous drinking that occur, and to broadly promote the
general good health of students so that it is perceived as normal not to
drink. 
At least 30 college campuses nationwide, including the universities of
Arizona, North Carolina, Oregon and Missouri, Rutgers University and 23
campuses of the California State University system, have joined the social
norming bandwagon to curb drinking among students. Dartmouth, home of the
Animal House legend, is currently in the market to hire an educator with
social norming experience. 
The philosophy has begun trickling down to high schools and middle schools
and has been expanded to target other risky behaviors, including smoking. 
It's viewed as an odd duck among health and safety educators, who
traditionally have been a polarized group of ''those who think we should
just crack down because people are dying and those civil libertarians who
preach 'kids will be kids,' '' says Drew Hunter, executive director of the
Bacchus & Gamma Peer Education Network, a Denver-based coalition of 1,000
colleges and universities that deals with health and safety issues. 
Campuses in general have seen little change in student drinking patterns,
despite comprehensive and consistent anti-drinking programs, Hunter says.
The social norming effort is showing results ''by promoting health, not
death and destruction.'' 
Easier said than done, says E. Scott Geller, psychology professor at
Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg, who is
less encouraged and feels ''more hard evidence is needed that it really does
decrease alcohol consumption campuswide.'' A social norming project there
has been successful at reducing student drinking, ''particularly among
women.'' But ''when we measure drinking at frat parties, we're not seeing
much of a change.'' The environment at those brotherhood blowouts, he says,
''overpowers social norms.'' 
Nationwide, Haines says, ''the simple norm is that most students are
drinking moderately, if at all, and are not harming anyone, and they'll
(mature into) effective, capable people.'' 
The social norming program works by simply reframing the same data that
traditionally highlights the minority of students who are boozing up heavily
and presenting it with a focus on the majority who aren't. The statistics
most often used on a national level are those from the ongoing Harvard
School of Public Health College Alcohol Study, National College Health
Assessment and the Core Alcohol and Drug Survey, all of which look at
college drinking patterns. The annual Monitoring the Future Study focuses on
students in grades 8, 10 and 12. 
Campuses develop their own norming programs by polling students and feeding
back to them -- in the form of posters, pencils, Frisbees and bumper
stickers -- data about the majority who aren't drinking, smoking or engaging
in other risky behavior. 
Funny thing, though, is that most students are surprised, since most
students -- like most parents -- think most kids are drinking and smoking.
That simply fuels the problem, says Lydia Gerzel Short, who is behind the
nation's first social norming program for high school students. Her
three-year program in two DeKalb County high schools has seen drinking and
smoking drop significantly faster than the national trends. 
With prom season in full swing, she says, many kids are getting subtle
messages from parents and teachers suggesting drinking is the norm.
''Parents will tell them, 'I know everyone will be drinking, so don't drink
and drive.' Teachers will tell them, too: 'I know everyone will be drinking
. . . ' But everyone won't be drinking. Most won't,'' she says. Yet kids who
hear those well-meaning mantras think, ''I want to fit in. I want to
belong.'' 
''Misperceptions create a silent majority,'' says Jan Gascoigne, director of
health promotions with Bacchus & Gamma, which last fall launched a
six-campus project with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to
study how social norming might curb college smoking. When the University of
Washington in Seattle polled students in 1999, it found that students
believed nearly 95% of the student body smoked. In reality, about one-third
were smokers. 
''Social norming breaks down that perception,'' says Gascoigne. ''If I'm a
student, and I think 95% of everybody smokes, there's a perception that
that's what people do here. Potentially that becomes my behavior because I
want to fit in.'' 
The drop in the rate of student smoking at the University of
Wisconsin-Oshkosh after last year's social-norm marketing campaign was so
astonishing, officials are reluctant to release the data nationally because
some population quirk may have skewed the numbers. The results: a 29% drop
in student smoking, or one out of three smokers quit. 
''We're saying, 'Whoa, we're a bunch of local yokels from Oshkosh,' '' says
Mike Altekruse, a counseling center psychologist. ''Maybe a cohort of
non-smokers came through, or maybe some DARE program really worked? It's a
little premature to say we're a great success.'' 
Like many colleges and universities that try social norming,
Wisconsin-Oshkosh turned to it as a ''last resort'' because nothing else was
making a dent in student drinking and smoking, Altekruse says. ''We
well-meaning health educators . . . just keep giving them knowledge that
it's unhealthy, and we hope they'll quit drinking. But they don't.'' 
Hunter is optimistic: ''We've begun to see with the social norming
movement,'' he says, ''that schools that have added that component have seen
significant reduction in drinking rates.''

Dear Governor Bush:

Please support the Coconut Grove Playhouse.  The Playhouse has the support of 
every member of the Dade Delegation as well as their colleagues in 
Tallahassee.  The Playhouse is awaiting instructions from the Secretary of 
State's office as to how to proceed to acquire the property.  I support 
appropriation item number 3130A that provides for operating funding to the 
Playhouse in the amount of $500,000.  This is supported by the conference 
report on HB27E, first engrossed.  As a Miami-Dade county resident, I feel 
that the Playhouse is one of the cultural jewels in our state. Thank you for 
your continued support of the Coconut Grove Playhouse.

Support Funding for the Coconut Grove Playhouse!

Dear Governor Bush

As a member of its Board of Trustees I support the appropriation item number 3130A that provides for operating funding to the Coconut Grove Playhouse in the amount of $500,000.  The entire Dade Delegation and their colleagues in Tallahassee support it as well. The Playhouse is one of the cultural jewels of not only Miami-Dade County but of our state.

The Playhouse was built in 1926 as a Paramount Movie theater. It was converted to a legitimate theater in 1956.  In 1926-27 my great-grandfather developed a technology that put sound on film and thus the talking motion picture was born.  He went on to develop a company that is known today as 20th Century Fox. It had 2000 movie theaters around the country.   Today, 4 remain; the Fox in Atlanta, St Louis, Detroit and San Diego all have been converted to live theaters. We have helped in saving each.  

Each one has major ongoing local and state support.  This funding appropriated by the legislature is vital to the survival of the Playhouse.  The Playhouse and all of the theaters have become vital cultural hubs in their cities and economic engines in their areas. 

Please support this appropriation.

Thank you for your continued support of the Coconut Grove Playhouse.

Sincerely,

Susan Fox Rosellini

Governor Bush,

Fred Dickinson of the Department of Motor Vehicles is considering an advanced encrypted and compressed barcode to be placed on Florida driver licenses.  Remarkably, Florida is one of eight states without barcodes on driver licenses.

The SSI system, developed by a company in Birmingham who principally contracts to US Intelligence agencies, is very advanced and allows several pages of information and biometrics to be included - fingerprints, etc.

It is worth considering this technology not only for public safety aspects, but higher level security for certain locations (airports, ports, etc.)

Best regards,

Rick

In the past two months, my students have:

Won the grand prize for best newscast at the National Broadcasting
Society convention (in competition with 93 other university entries).
They're won the grand prize in that category five times in the past ten
years.

Won the best newcast award from the Florida Associate Press.  A first
for us; FSU is always a major competitor.

Won two prestigious, national "Telly" awards for production of "UMIQ," a
college quiz program, and "42nd Street Uncovered," a documentary.
Open to all cable and satellite television production, this is not a
student competition.

In addtion three of my journalism students won highly competitive summer
fellowships, one from the Freedom Forum (a $1000 scholarship and a paid
internship at the Louisville Courier-Journal), the Academy of
Alternative Journalism (funded by newspapers like The Village Voice and
The New Times,  the fellowship includes a free summer's study at
Northwestern's Medill School of Journalism and a $3,000 stipend; over
800 students applied for 10 openings), and the National Gay and Lesbian
Task Force (which includes a $5000 scholarship and a job writing for the
media about the pending election to repeal Miami-Dade's Human Rights
Ordinance).

It's so much fun to have this job.  Hope all is well with you.

Perry. The organization's goal is to improve business and tourism in
Perry and Taylor County.
   We're in the processing of applying for a grant to renovate an old

It's a good project for a good cause, and I'm hoping to get your support

project. We're gathering these from a variety of officials, including
folks like Allen Boyd and Will Kendrick.
   Is there someone in your office with whom you can put me in contact
to handle this? I can send them a couple of sample support letters and a
copy of the grant (it's fairly short). They can draw up a brief letter
of support for you to sign, if you're willing. It shouldn't take more
than about 15 minutes of an assistant's time.
   Hope you can help.

My staff is having difficulty coordinating our schedules to make this work.
The magazine goes out to thousands of subscribers statewide.

You are in Orlando on Monday. I am available as are the Bankers. Your staff
is saying that you do not have the time.

My staff has been working with your staff closely on several other options.
However, this is the first opportunity where our schedules actually
converge. The photo will only take 10 minutes. If you can work it in, let me
know or have your staff call Brian Chase 321-223-5552.

Thanks,

Agencies build up, dash modeling dreams



Authorities are investigating modeling agents who charge big fees for photos and promise jobs that don't materialize. 


By TIM GRANT, Times Staff Writer
© St. Petersburg Times
published March 26, 2002 

  _____  


TAMPA -- At 79, Lois Krebs is not the typical runway fashion model. But she thought she might find a place in ads that appeal to senior citizens. 


"I had a notion I could do what I saw other people my age doing on television," said Krebs, a great-grandmother. 


The first agent she met at Models 2000 Inc. told Krebs she had a distinctive look that companies want to sell their products. When Krebs got no work there, she tried another agent at Boom Talent & Modeling Agency, who also fed her hopes for a successful modeling career. 


Krebs says that between the two agencies, she paid about $1,200 for photographs they said she needed to launch her career. But they quit calling after she bought the photographs. And a year later, Krebs still has no work as a model. 


Her story is common in Tampa Bay's talent and modeling community. 


A handful of agencies here have gained a reputation for making money off expensive photographs after promising to find modeling work for people who have little chance of being models. 


Now Krebs and about 40 others who bought photographs at Models 2000 have written affidavits supporting a Hillsborough County civil lawsuit against its owner, Nancy Sniffen. And Tampa police say they are conducting a criminal investigation of the agency at 4844 W Gandy Blvd. 


"I want her shut down and I want restitution paid to the other victims," said Rick West, a retired Detroit firefighter, who is suing Sniffen on behalf of his 17-year-old daughter Christy, who paid $855 and got only photos, not jobs. 


Sniffen, who also uses the last name Keogh, declined to comment for this report. 


Although there are no complaints against Models 2000 on record with the state agency that oversees the talent and modeling industry, dozens of customers say they have aired their grievances with the Department of Business and Professional Regulation. 


Some also have complained to the Tampa Police Department, prompting a criminal investigation that began last year, said police spokeswoman Katie Hughes. She said the department will not comment on the case in progress. 


A spokesman for the state Attorney General's Office said authorities in Tampa have received complaints about Models 2000, but because state law gives DBPR jurisdiction over modeling agencies, that agency will handle the case. 


West and other former customers of Models 2000 said they have been contacted by an investigator from DBPR, though officials at the state agency will not confirm a formal probe. 


The lawsuit West filed against Sniffen in March 2001 accuses her of fraud, trickery and misrepresentation. 


According to West's lawsuit, Christy answered a newspaper ad in January 2000 seeking teen models for print, movie and fashion work. It seemed like a job with high pay and travel opportunities. She ended up paying $855 for photographs, but Sniffen never got her a modeling job. 


"I said that's a lot of money and we can't afford it," said West's wife, Fiona, who was with her daughter at the interview with the agency. "But (Sniffen) said Christy would make that money back in no time because she had a partner in Atlanta connected with J.C. Penney Co., who could get Christy in the catalog." 


West said he eventually asked Sniffen to refund the money and she refused. When he learned that the state would not order a refund, he filed a lawsuit and began looking for other unhappy customers. 


Using the Internet and word-of-mouth, he found about 40 of them. Several informed J.C. Penney that Sniffen had promised them jobs with the company. 


Alan Langer, a lawyer for the department store chain in Dallas, wrote Sniffen on July 13, 2001, ordering her to stop using the retail company in her sales pitch. 


"As you know, such representations are false," the letter said. 


One of the people West found was Gina Hughes, a former Models 2000 customer who also was busy locating former customers. 


Hughes said she paid $1,040 for photographs of her 3-year-old daughter, Gabriella. She said her bank refunded $700 after it investigated her complaint. Now she wants to keep others from going through what she did. 


She remembers the people she met the day of her daughter's photo shoot at Models 2000: a farm worker who hoped her daughter could help generate income for the family; a single mother with her preschool son; and a beautiful Brazilian woman who did not speak English. 


"I saw the people who were there and I just think they need their money back," Hughes said. 


According to state law, talent and modeling agents are not supposed to charge models for anything, including photos, seminars or consultation. An agent's income is supposed to come solely from commissions received through finding work for models. 


In Carrollwood, modeling agent Di Paulson has had multiple complaints against her in recent years for selling photos and other products through a second company that she ran inside her Boom Talent & Modeling office. Paulson has since moved her business to Safety Harbor. She did not return telephone messages seeking comment. 


Publishers of the Florida Bluesheet, an industry newsletter in Orlando, hear many of the complaints about bad business practices throughout the state. They say Tampa Bay has a few agencies that give the area a bad name. 


"We get more complaints from Tampa than Miami, which is surprising because Miami has more agencies," said Gersh Morningstar, Florida Bluesheet's publisher. 


Morningstar said many complaints involve agents slow to pay models after a job. With Models 2000 and Boom Talent & Modeling, the complaints almost always involves people who say they have paid for overpriced, poor-quality pictures with hopes of modeling careers that didn't happen. 


One Tampa modeling agency that consistently gets jobs for its clients is Alexa Model & Talent at 4100 W Kennedy Blvd., which has been in business since 1988. 


"We make our money off people working," said owner Susan Schwabinger. "We don't just take anyone on as a model because if they don't work, we're not making money." 


Still, she said she cannot always predict which models will make it big. "There are no guarantees," she said. "This is the most unpredictable business in the world."

Subject:	RE: Lack of water in Florida

Ms. Parker, thank you for writing. We are doing something about it as you say. First, we are spending hundreds of millions of dollars (double the money before) on water protection and restoration projects. Secondly, on Friday, I am signing a growth management law which is the most comprehensive reform since the law was created in the 1980's. Included in this bill is a requirement of communities to include water resources as part of the development process. In addition, during my watch, we have complied with a law for the first time that gets the management districts to establish minimum levels and flows that will help us on a long term basis. We have done all of this during a severe draught that has strained the state immensely. 

I appreciate your writing and rest assured I take what you say seriously.

Jeb Bush

Dear Governor bush,

        With much respect, I write to you because I am very worried about
the water situation in my state.  I really do believe you could do
something about it, if you tried.

        As you know, the lakes are drying up and there is a definite
water shortage.  I read recently that in six years we would have no more
water to use.  What are you doing about it?  Are you trying to do
anything?

        Why don't you see that no more building permits are given out to
developers and others who want to build.  Each time a house or apartment
is built, water will be used for drinking, cleaning, flushing toilets and
other things.  There is plenty of housing available without building any
more, until the water shortage is corrected.  

        Why are lakes still being drained when there is a storm, etc. 
This is ridiculous.  I was born in Daytona Beach, Florida.  I am now 80
years old and know of how life has been in the past, in this wonderful
state.  Years ago water was not taken from the lakes and there were no
major problems.  Now, my son-in-law cannot get his boat out of the shed
because it is dry.  

        I have lived a long time and I am smart.  I have learned.  I have
been aware of the changes going on in Florida.  Most of it is because of
greed.  Yes - - - - GREED.  You heard me.  Greed is the biggest culprit. 
All people can think of is making that almighty dollar.  They do not care
about the consequences of their deeds, as long as they get the money.

        A few months ago, I wrote to you about our land being gouged. 
Forests are being eliminated because of constant building of apartments
and housing, which is not needed.  The wild animals will soon have no
place to live.  You did not even give me the courtesy of answering my
letter.

        You are our Governor.  I voted for you but am very disappointed
is what is going on in Florida.  PLEASE GET BUSY AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT
IT.  I am pleading with you, sir.  

        I do hope you read this letter, for once.  I feel like your aides
do not give you things to read.  To me, this letter is very important.  

        Thank you for all you are doing for Florida.  

        Very sincerely,


        Thelma W. Parker

My understanding is it's part of a 99 year lease (Lease #2564(?)) from TIIF

Governor Bush-

I recently spoke with Barbara Wilcox, my (favorite) aunt, asking her
advice
with an issue and she suggested I contact you to ask for your
assistance.
Just within the last 48 hours it has become obvious that time is of the
essence.

I have lived in Pinellas County and boated in the Gulf waters for over
20
years.  There are a number of islands which are part of the Gulf Islands
Geo
Parks System that many boaters visit and enjoy.  We (the boaters) have
peacefully co-existed with the various animals and shorebirds since
nature
created these islands.

Recently the Parks Department has begun to actively regulate and
restrict
our usage basing their actions on unsubstantiated data.  Signs have
appeared
"overnight" and law enforcement has begun patrolling the islands.  At
issue
are NO pets, NO overnight camping, NO camp fires, NO alcohol, NO
overnight
anchoring close to some of the islands.

"S.O.S." or Save Our Sandbar, a grass roots group of boaters was formed
to
explore the validity of the Parks claiming and enforcing jurisdiction on
the
islands.  As a result of group members contacting our elected officials
and
attending local government meetings a proposal was offered by the Parks
Department which we interpreted as a starting point for resolution to
this
issue. Discussion of the proposal was the main item on the agenda of our
May
22nd meeting.

In addition to a lawyer S.O.S. has retained to advise us on our options,
two
representatives from the Parks Department were at the meeting.  Since we
were to discuss our legal and non-legal options, the two gentlemen were
asked to leave.  I was in ear shot of the entire conversation and once
the
situation was explained, the two men left -it was all very amicable.
 
The very next morning the Fish & Wildlife Department showed up on the
North
Anclote Sandbar, erected signs and roped off a fairly large portion of
the
island.  They also informed boaters anchored there that this weekend
(Memorial Day) they would be heavily patrolling and enforcing the
restrictions.

Whether the actions of the Fish & Wildlife Department were in
retaliation of
the Parks Department representatives being asked to leave, who knows.
But I
fear this is going to escalate into something big and ugly...FAST.  Egos
are
taking over and emotions are starting to run high and unfortunately
those at
the extreme ends of this issue are going to push this past negotiating
and
into the courts.

I know you are an extremely busy man (oh, and thanks for keeping our
phone
bills down) but this issue cuts to the very core of citizens' rights to
enjoy where we have chosen to live and recreate.  Any intervention or
assistance on your part would be immensely appreciated.

While students around the nation finish term papers and final exams, 
Congress won’t receive its report card from the voters until 
November. The volatile political environment since September 11th is 
wreaking havoc with prognosticators’ predictions. Voters’ opinions of 
Congress itself have fluctuated wildly. From a thirty year high of 
85% approval in October 2001, Congressional job approval ratings have 
fallen back to pre-attack levels (along with a host of other key 
indicators). Today, 54% of American voters approve of the job 
Congress is doing, actually down one point from August 2001.

Dear Governor Bush:

Please support the Coconut Grove Playhouse!

The Playhouse has the support of every member of the Dade Delegation,  as
well as their colleagues in Tallahassee.  The Playhouse is awaiting
instructions from the Secretary of State's office as to how to proceed to
acquire the property. 

 I support appropriation item number 3130A that provides for operating
funding to the Playhouse in the amount of $500,000.  This is supported by
the conference report on HB27E, first engrossed.  

As a Miami-Dade county resident, a Republican, and someone that voted for
you  I ask for your support in retaining this critical funding.
The Playhouse is one of the cultural jewels in our state, providing not only
excellent theatre for our community, but excellent and far-reaching
educational programs both at the Playhouse and with an in-school program. It
is critical for our youth to continue to be enriched with the arts and
theatre. 

Thank you for your continued support of the Coconut Grove Playhouse.


PS -  Perhaps you remember me from my prior days at United Airlines when you
headed up your mission to Brazil and flew with United - I was the General
Manager for United at the time.

Dear Mr. Hansen,

Thank you for responding to my email, on behalf of Governor Bush. Your
detailed explanation of the bill is appreciated. However, I am one of
those individuals that have health problems so I have no other options
for getting alternate, lower cost, Health Care Insurance. My policy
renewal does not come up till next April. If the increase stays within
the 25% you indicated as the first increase, I may be able to tolerate
it for an additional year. If the increase is higher, I will probably be
contacting you again next year.

Jeb:	
My mind is always working and I had an idea on how to
check on foster children.

Start off with the Florida League of Teachers.  We are
already checked with the authorities and you know we
care.  After the League, recruit teachers to do the
checking.

Payment:  We all need 6 credits for recertification
every 5 years.  How about keeping track of our hours
and submitting it monthly.  They can go towards a bank
for renewal.  Or, the state can pay us a set rate?

Good idea?  You know the job will get done!!!

DCF Social Workers have Lap Top Computers & Technology.  Lap Tops are
good.  HSN is bad, as it is.

IMHO Social Workers should have one program which to enter cases to, one
that::  rolls over, is simple, fast, establishes case ownership
accountability, and eliminates dual and triple reporting requirements.

Social Workers also deserve MORE money.  There's allot of money in the
DCF bureaucracy; but, not at the most vital level:  FIELD and COURT.   A
good Social Worker must be Smart, Sharp and Work Hard.  To retain a good
hire; or, an experienced Social Worker you must Motivate them with your
Support, Weed out those who abuse the flex time and don't share the
load, allow some latitude for the exercise of good Judgment, and
increase their Pay.

Recently, I looked at the 4th year summary of a program that had been
TAX PAYER FUNDED for 4 out of the 5 years of the 1st phase of the
contract.  When I asked for the data on Service to Children, there was
NONE; because, the program had not yet entered into that Phase of the
Program.  END Of STORY:   the program had used hundreds of thousands of
dollars on planning, consultants, infra structure, planning, & planning,
and..................planning.  Millions of dollars have been likewise
(LIKE DUMB) spent in this manner!  I agree with your statement, that we
can find the MONEY.

Good Social Workers don't enter Social Services for the MONEY (those
that do are BAD from the get go), they should however, be compensated
fairly for their knowledge, experience, and their risk.

Good Night.

Jeb:

I received several press calls late afternoon today suggesting that there is likely action on the Chevron well permit in the Gulf - at least that is speculation. Several environmental groups active on that issue have gotten a call from DEP with an indication that "David Struhs Wants to Brief Them".  Some newspapers apparently have picked up on it and are speculating that the "anticipated announcement" is the Chevron Well decison. The other environmental group people who were called by David's office apparently were told something vague about "a major announcement on a Florida Environmental issue from the White House". At least one reporter (Pittman, St. Pete Times) was told by David's office that he was in route to DC.

Federal concurrance in Florida's objections to the Chevron well would, of course, be wonderful.

Any light you can shed would be greatly appreciated!

Dear Governor Bush: 

Thank you for the quality time you spent with me and the rest of the Save-A-Friend group last week.  Although I regret to say that I did not fully appreciate it at the time, I cannot adequately express how valuable your input was.  Following our meeting, and throughout this past week, the Save-A-Friend team went back to the drawing board and modified the program so that it can work on a state-by-state basis.  In fact, the program may even work better given the realities of the governmental/political structures we have to interact with. 

Of course, we would like Florida to be the first state and for you to be at the forefront once the program is in place and has demonstrated its effectiveness.  There is no question in my mind, Governor, given my many years of experience, that this program works and will work for Florida! 

I would like to keep you updated as we continue to fine-tune the program to better fit a state-by-state approach.  In fact, the Save-A-Friend group would very much appreciate the opportunity, in the near future, to again meet with you and brief you on the modified program, prior to us also presenting it to Education Commissioner Charlie Christ and key members of the state legislature, as you suggested. 

Incidentally, with your permission, the Florida plan will include all state two and four year colleges in addition to K-12.   

Once again, thank you for your interest and feedback. 

Best Wishes,

Bush has no claim to 'education governor' title
By Dan Gelber
SPECIAL TO THE DEMOCRAT

The same month that Gov. Jeb Bush kicks off his campaign to convince voters
that he is Florida's "education governor," the national rankings for
education spending were released. This year, the year that Gov. Bush boasts
of a billion-dollar budget increase, Florida has attained, for the first
tim=
under any governor's watch, the ignoble position of having the lowest per
capita spending on public education in the entire nation. Dead last.

Undaunted, the governor claims his "increase" in school funding
demonstrates=20
his commitment to public schools. That recently released FCAT scores
evidenc=
his successes. The irrefutable data, however, suggests that under Gov.
Bush,=20
Florida's public schools have never been in worse condition.

This year, Florida's high school seniors' ACT and SAT scores have fallen to
their lowest point in a decade. Among the 50 states, Florida's high school
graduation rate is now 49th, with only Alabama scoring worse. Our
student-teacher ratio ranks 43rd and Florida's teachers are paid nearly
$5,000 below the national average .

The governor's "billion-dollar increase" in education funding is illusory
an=
misleading and won't solve anything. The recently approved education budget
doesn't account for an 88,000 increase in new students or factor in a
2-percent inflation rate. Nor does Gov. Bush calculate his substantial
budge=
cuts occurring in last year's special session.

After all is said and done, his 2002 budget increase in K-12 is actually a
$73 million decrease in per student spending. Further, in crafting his
education budget, he utilized some irresponsible and short-term funding
strategies that will only serve to postpone - until after his re-election
bi=
- additional shortfalls. By bolstering his election year budget with
nonrecurring funds, he guarantees Floridians a multibillion-dollar hole in
our budget next year.

Similarly, Gov. Bush's reliance on this years recently released FCAT test
results to show schools are performing better under his watch is also
misleading. The FCAT was never intended to be a report card for our public
schools. The FCAT, as it was originally conceived and used, was merely a
diagnostic tool utilized by teachers to help them assess how well some
basic=20
skills were being learned.

It does not calculate many of the factors that any parent would want to
take=20
into account when measuring the quality of a school such as student/teacher
ratios, school safety, and teacher training and salaries. Nor does it
factor=20
in the socioeconomic background of students and the availability of
resource=
that differ widely from school to school. Overemphasis on the test as a
grading instrument for schools has resulted in schools "teaching the test"
a=
the expense of all else.

But for Gov. Bush's purposes it works fine. Given how badly Florida's
school=
and students compare to other states on national standardized tests and in
nearly every recognized benchmark of school achievement and performance,
the=20
FCAT scores may be the only measuring tool inaccurate enough to award
Florida's schools a passing grade. Yet, rather than admit that Florida's
schools need greater attention and resources, the Bush administration
relies=20
upon an infirm grading instrument to claim our schools are improving.

In fairness, success in education reform demands the type of intensive,
long-range approach and resources that doesn't bear fruit between election
cycles. Perhaps some day a governor of Florida will truly meet the issue
wit=
a bold plan that electrifies our citizens and gains their support.

Rather than create some pretend formula for declaring educational
successes,=20
Floridians need a real route that measures true performance. That's how you
earn the title "education governor."

McBride dares Bush to debate education
By Mark Silva
Sentinel Political Editor
May 24, 2002
TALLAHASSEE -- Fleshing out details of a $1 billion plan for public
education -- and new taxes to pay for it -- Democrat Bill McBride
invited Gov. Jeb Bush on Thursday to debate him "up and down the state."
McBride, a Tampa-area attorney, explained his goals for education in
advance of the leading Democrat in the governor's race, former U.S.
Attorney General Janet Reno.
"All the political people say, 'Don't propose taxes.' I don't think
that's right," he said. "I want the people to know that I will propose,
that I will go to the people of Florida and tell them, 'I think we've
got to get new revenue.' "
McBride's pitch comes as Bush campaigns by boasting of his own
commitment to education. Bush secured $1 billion in new school spending
from the Legislature this year, capping a $3 billion increase during his
term.
Critics complain that Bush's 27 percent increase in spending has barely
kept pace with growing school enrollment and inflation and merely offset
some of the state budget-cutting forced by the recent recession.
But the Governor's Office, anticipating McBride's criticism, was ready
with an analysis of spending over four years showing that while
enrollment has increased 10.5 percent, Bush's increases still equate to
a 15 percent gain per student.
"I'll debate him up and down across the state," said McBride, keeping
from criticism of Reno. "I'm running against Jeb Bush."
While Bush boasts of cutting taxes, McBride proposes raising some: His
spending plan for smaller classes, higher teacher pay and pre-schooling
for "at-risk" 4-year-olds, is largely based on a new 50 cent per-pack
tax on cigarettes.
"It is my greatest hope and desire that Bill McBride will run on a
platform exclusively designed on taxes -- 'If elected, I, Bill McBride,
will raise your taxes,' " said Lt. Gov. Frank Brogan, Bush's
running-mate.
Although McBride relies on a tax increase unlikely to pass Florida's
Republican-run Legislature, McBride says lawmakers will come around if
he is elected. Reno, who also speaks of smaller classes, has not yet
proposed how to pay for them.
Reno will unveil a plan for education soon, said Mo Elleithee, campaign
manager.
Reno will spend much of the next two weeks making fund-raising calls,
preparing for a June 7 event featuring actor Martin Sheen. Bo Diddley
and Friends will entertain at The Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables, and
Reno will bring Sheen to Orlando the next day.
McBride, planning 32 fund-raising events in June, was raising money in
Tallahassee on Thursday at a $250-per-person reception whose hosts
included some of the lawyers from Holland & Knight, the firm he ran
before running for governor.
For education, McBride proposes another $1 billion after the basic costs
of growing enrollment are counted:
Pre-kindergarten schooling for "at-risk" 4-year olds, at a cost of $150
million a year. Eventually, he says the state can offer pre-K for all.
At least two years of "small-class instruction" -- no more than 22
children in a room -- in kindergarten to Grade 3, at a cost of $300
million.
Pay raises for teachers, raising the average salary by $2,500 a year,
bringing salaries up, but still shy of the national average. It costs
$434 million.
Remedial tutoring for children failing state achievement tests, and
eliminating Bush's use of student testing to assign grades to schools:
$100 million.
More construction, drawing on existing revenue from Florida's lottery,
$100 million, to support $1 billion in bonds.
To pay for this, McBride proposes drawing most of his new money, $565
million, from a 50 cent increase in cigarette taxes, now 33.9 cents per
pack.
He proposes finding another $100 million by holding the line against
"turkeys," hometown legislative projects. He says he can find another
$136 million in cost savings that Florida TaxWatch has identified and
$206 million going to other government spending.
He also claims he can close $101 million of "indefensible" loopholes in
the tax code. This includes a $50 million credit for companies covering
private school tuition, a $24 million break for new businesses buying
machinery, $7 million in airport exemptions, $5 million for contact lens
manufacturers and $3 million for hotels that offer complimentary meals.

Subject:	FFN Response

This is in response to your electronic letter to Governor Bush dated May
24, 2002, in reference to the Florida Fiber Network and the Department=s
actions on the proposals received from Florida Fiber Network, Inc. (FFNI)
and Aptus Corporation (Aptus).

First, please let me provide a little background on the subject.

In  March,  2000,  the Department issued a Request for Proposals to solicit
proposals  for  a  lease  of  limited  access rights-of-way in exchange for
fiber-optic  telecommunication infrastructure for the Department=s use  and
which  would  also allow the lessee to use the rights-of-way for a private,
for-profit  commercial  network.    A fundamental tenet for such a lease is
the  financial  responsibility  of  the  lessee.   Section 337.251, Florida
Statutes,  and  the  implementing  rules  and  policies  require  that  the
Department  determine that a proposer demonstrate that it has the financial
capacity  and wherewithal to undertake a project before  such rights-of-way
are leased.

Of  the  five  proposals received in response in the RFP, FFNI was selected
for  a  lease.   Based on its assertion that it had the financial capacity,
but  needed  some  time  to  effectuate  a  final  financial  program,  the
Department,  on  July 14, 2000, granted FFNI the lease, and provided ninety
days  for  it  to  produce  a  viable  financial  program.   After  several
extensions  of  time,  the  Department, in accordance with the terms of the
lease,  terminated  the lease with FFNI on May 14, 2001, for FFNI=s failure
to obtain the necessary financing.

On  October  27, 2001, FFNI, filed an unsolicited proposal based on the RFP
and  its  earlier  proposal,  again  asserting  that  it  had the financial
capability to undertake the project.  As required by statute the Department
provided  public  notice  of  this  unsolicited  proposal and invited other
entities  to  submit  competing  proposals.  Aptus filed such a proposal on
January 31, 2002.

FFNI  in  its  unsolicited  proposal  and again at the Oral Presentation on
March  28  asserted  that  it  had the financing necessary to undertake the
project  and  would  provide  proof  within a week, but no later than April
17th.   Aptus  stated  that it needed ninety days to put together its final
financing program.

In  the Department=s Agency Action of April 22, 2002, both the FFNI and the
Aptus  proposals  were selected for further negotiation.  Because of FFNI=s
representation  that  it  could  provide  proof of its financial capability
within a week, the Department gave FFNI ten days to demonstrate that it had
secured   the   financing   that  it  had  proposed,  and  which  could  be
independently  verified  by  the  Department.   On  May  2,  FFNI filed a A
Commitment  Memorandum,@  which had been executed by Florida Fiber Network,
Inc.  (FFNI),  The  Oxford  Financial  Group, and Global Arbitrage, Inc. on
April  9,  2002.   This  ACommitment@ by its own terms was subject to being
withdrawn  on  April  26,  if the financing arrangements were not closed by
then.   The  Department was unable to verify the continued validity of this
commitment  or  that  the  entities  involved  had  committed the financial
wherewithal  to effectuate the financing.  Hence, the need for the May 10th
letter  that  Acaught@  your  attention  on  the  Department=s Web Site and
ostensibly prompted the subject e-mail to the Governor.

With  this  background, you must understand, the Department has been overly
patient  and  very  fair  in  allowing  FFNI time to arrange its financing.
However,   after  several  failed  attempts,  the  Department needs to take
prudent action, and avoid expending more state resources unwisely.

In  the  April  Agency  Action, the Department gave both FFNI and Aptus the
right  to  continue  forward  to  negotiating   the  lease-- there being no
prohibition  for  the  Department  from entering into two leases.  FFNI was
given the shorter time period because that is what FFNI proposed.

As  to  your  contention  the Department somehow favors Aptus is erroneous.
The  record  is clear that the Department has treated both proposers fairly
and   even-handedly.   These  proposals  were  examined  and  evaluated  by
technical,  engineering, financial, and legal experts within the Department
with  the  assistance  of  knowledgeable consultants.  The Agency Action is
predicated on their collective recommendations that had resulted from their
independent professional judgement.

I  must take issue with your allusion that an Aptus sub-contractor has been
allowed  to  provide undue influence with the Department or with me in this
matter.   That  firm  is but one of several subcontractors to Aptus.  There
are  former  Department  employees  on the teams for both proposers.   Both
proposals  were  evaluated  on  their  merits,  and  both were selected for
further negotiations.

In answer to your specific questions, I respond as follows:

     1.    AThis@  was  awarded  to  FFNI.   Upon  compliance  with its own
promises, the Department was ready to proceed to the final document.
     2.    The  Department  is  Aworried@  about funding because it has the
fiduciary duty to protect state resources.  If a proposer shows that it has
the wherewithal to complete the installation of fiber, the Department would
allow  it  to  proceed.   But, the situation with FFNI, is its inability to
demonstrate that it has funds to start, let alone the financial ability, to
complete, the first segment.
     3.   There is no conflict of interest.  The Department=s decisions are
based  on  the collective advice of experts and professionals in accordance
with applicable statutes and rules.
     4.    The  Department  has  not  offered Aptus, or any other provider,
rights  over FFNI.  FFNI has the same, equal rights granted by the statute,
as  any other entity. The Department is diligently proceeding to accomplish
the fiber-optic project in accordance with the requirements of the statute.
The  Department  fully  expects  that entities that file proposals with the
Department  to  be  able to fulfill the representations in those proposals,
e.g.  FFNI=s  representation  that  it  had the financing and would provide
proof thereof within a week.

If you take the time to review the documents (all of which are available on
the  Department=s  Web  Site), I am sure you will come to the understanding
that  the  Department=s  decision in reference to the subject was conducted
fully  in  compliance  with  the governing statutes, and that the facts and
circumstances  set  forth  in  each  of the proposals justified the actions
taken.

If you have further questions,I will be glad to discuss them with you.

GOVERNOR BUSH:
 
Respectfully I address this e-mail to you on behalf of Taimira Leiva and the homeowners of subject.
 
I have been corresponding via phone and e-mails with Tay and this afternoon she came over so we could meet personally.
 
She brought along hundreds of pages all divided by issues and in immense binders and I cannot express to you the magnitude of this case. Taimira Leiva is a young minute lady that packs one big heart, a punch of energy that is unbeleivable and one issue that is 100 times her size.  She will not give up and she has the facts to prove her case and that of 300+ homeowners at Miramar/Vista Verde.
 
This is not an easy to solve case and I was taken aghast when she forwarded to me the e-mail that follows from Carlos Muniz, whom you requested to review the facts.  Mr. Muniz right off the bat is coming to see this case with a AN OBVIOUS NEGATIVE ATTITUDE which I have underlined in red. How can Taimira Leiva present her facts to an attorney that comes with his mind already made up?  These people need someone with an OPEN MIND willing to spend time in a case that could be of
great impact in the lives of all middle-class homeowners that are abused by the so called HOA'S, their lawyers, and board of directors. Sir: YOU HAVE TO HELP! 
 
Governor: These people have valid issues, they are medium to low-income mostly Hispanics the security of their homeowners is at stake by a group that has the clout of using police and justice against them.These homeowners are about to loose their homes because of vindictive actions by third parties!
 
Please Governor Bush, INTERVENE, TIME IS RUNNING OUT!
 
We trusted you in the polls, you have done wonderful things, please continue your straight-forward actions and use your power to help these people before their are thrown out of their castles!
 
Gracias!

I know that I am just a "little" person in the realm of this world, but I wanted to thank you for all of your hard work and dedication, especially lately with the whole FL Task Force thing and the Rilya case. I can't begin to imagine the extreme amount of stress and pressure the two of you are going through and are going to continue to face.  I pray that you will keep your sanity and your determination to do the right thing for Florida's most vulnerable.

I read the Blue Ribbon report and I was impressed with what they had to say. I hope that these issues will not go away after Rilya is forgotten.

There was one thing that I was concerned about that I did read.  There was a statement that stated that the number of adoptions had increased dramitically.  My concerns is that kids are being adopted by the right people and for the right reasons.  My hope is that kids aren't being adopted like I was to be later then "turned back in" when they are so cute or loveable anymore.  I would have rather lived my entire childhood in the system and not to have been adopted rather than be adopted and turned back in. It makes one feel like they are not good enough and or not loveable.  This to me is a huge injustice.  This injustice follows people through the rest of their lives and effects future relationships and behaviors.

Thanks again for your dedication to this "system"  and the REAl FEELINGS and needs of children.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
 
Orange County voted to terminate our charter tonight. We had quite a few parents and supporters as well as students but they still denied it. We have proof they have done illegal things. We have not done anything to have this charter terminated. They are mad becasue we challenged them on the transportation costs.
It is difficult now, because they parents don't want to go back to the public schools they were failing in. They had a chance at our school.
We will be appealing.
 
Some of the negative publicity has gotten over to Seminole. We just completed an Internal Audit and everything was fine. Now because Orange County had problems, there must be a reason to be concerned.
I don't know what to say, but I have worked very hard in getting these schools set up and have always been one to put 100% in what I am doing. I am not sure what to think anymore. It is hard fighting.

I was pleased to hear excellent comments about the Miami speech from

were exactly right.
It looks like Social Promotion/Administrative Placement is finally
ending here.  The school staff seems to have gotten the message.
Newspaper headline, "1000 kids to repeat 4th grade."  You need to know
some parents are blaming "the state" for this.  I countered last night
at the board meeting with suggestions how to get the failing students
the help they need.  It was a great speech but the supt. was not
pleased. He insisted it was his place to decide how to remediate the
failing students, not mine.  I guess I hit a nerve.

Subject:	Re: [flfpa] Blue Ribbon Panel

Thanks for the update Trudy.  I haven't read the whole report, but I would have really liked to see the issue of relative placements addressed in the sense of ensuring the relative IS a relative.  We had a similar situation as foster parents in Leon County in 1999 where a young child was placed from our home with who they thought was the sister of the father.  We had strong evidence to show that the father wasn't really the father- so the Aunt wouldn't have been the Aunt.  DCF folks told us then that could very well be the case, they don't test paternity -unless two or more fathers present themselves.  They have to rely on who is on the birth certificate. Well of course the mother would have listed him as she was being abused by this strongman. I still wonder about this child as we suspect it was the father that almost killed the child twice (at 2 months and 8 months old)- he had the motivation as the mother had cheated on him and the baby was from another man.  Now, with his sister having the child he will see that child and probably have many opportunities to further hurt that child.  Mom signed off her rights as she wouldn't talk and cooperate- she was too afraid to.

I understand this was also the case with Rilya's placement.  I hope they initiate and enforce determining paternity and relational placements to ensure the safety of the children.  I don't believe these are isolated issues.

Mary,

Thank you as usual for getting this information to our people.  

I was there this morning when the Governor arrived and we spoke briefly.  I told him the bottom line was that without the foster parents the system would be in shambles!  That we need to empower the foster parents to do their job for the children without fear and intimidation.  I told him that we MUST be included as an equal partner in all aspects of DCF/private providers working together.

I told him that our foster parents are professional people in the community and unless treated with respect and communicated with we will continue to loose them. And the bottom line is that the children will suffer.  I told him that had foster parents been listened to this might not have happened.

This was the best I could do in the few minutes I had to speak with him.  I was very appreciative of Doreen Rutledge in allowing me those few minutes and the opportunity for my husband, myself and our adopted girls to meet Governor Bush.  I was told he listens to the people before the administration, so lets see.

I have never been involved in a Blue Ribbon panel before so I have no experience to draw from.  I must say I was impressed by the amount of information DCF provided the Panel.  I learned a lot about the money issues and all the "strings" attached.  I believe the four panel members are some of the most caring child advocates we have here in Miami and that they WILL make sure their recommendations are carried out.  I have great faith this report will NOT be placed on a shelf and collect dust.  I can tell you that my husband and I, along with Juli and Michael Millsap will do our best to represent the foster parents and push for this report to make a difference.

Bev. you asked about the suggestions, they are the mediation board, business and faith support of the alliance, background checks for the **relative and non-relative caregivers, fingerprints in each child's file, and dated cameras for quarterly pictures.  Sorry I did not get back to you sooner. (**the background checks on the relative and non-relative caregivers is what is new, yes we as foster parents have as always had to have background checks, doing the all the relative and non-relative placements already in existence is going to be a monumental task as well as expensive. )

AS far as the worker and the supervisor on Rilya Wilson's case.  I believe the Panel made it clear that she and the supervisor are clearly to blame.  I have never personally worked with Muskelly, but I have had many children in that Unit and worked with WIllie Harris the supervisor.  I personally believe them to be completely responsible and not to be scapegoats for administration.

I hope I have been able to provide some insight to these proceedings and will keep  you posted on how we do here in District 11.

Governor endorses low-cost solutions to child-welfare problems

Posted: May 28, 2002 03:58 PM
MIAMI (AP) -- Gov. Jeb Bush endorsed a low-cost approach Tuesday to
solving
some of the problems cited by a panel examining the case of a 5-year-old
child in state care whose disappearance went unnoticed for 15 months.

Bush promised to comply with the panel's report and work with lawmakers
on
costlier issues that will take more time.

"We know that we can do better and we have work to do," he said. "We
have
made significant progress in a very difficult, challenging, complicated
area of public policy."

Bush was reacting to a 28-page report issued Monday by a committee he
assigned to investigate the state's handling of Rilya Wilson, 5, who is
still missing a month after her disappearance was noticed.

Bush called the wide-ranging report "a good solid blueprint" for change
in
the state Department of Children & Families and endorsed the agency's
leadership by Kathleen Kearney despite calls by others for her
resignation.
Bush issued an executive order to name a new group to pursue changes
that
don't need legislative approval and report back in late September.

Key long-term recommendations by the panel include increasing the pay
for
new child-protection workers and providing $1.5 million for full
criminal
background checks on 62,000 existing caregivers.

But Bush said he was "wary" of the panel's call for a special
legislative
session to address the needs of Florida's abused and neglected children.
And when asked if he supported higher pay, he said it would be part of
an
overall review of employee retention, training and benefits.

Bill McBride, a Democratic candidate for governor, supported the idea of
a
special session, saying, "The state cannot wait for another tragedy to
act
decisively."

On pay raises, state Rep. Carlos Lacasa, R-Miami, the chief House budget
writer, said, "If we're going to pay, then we're going to have to start
looking at the revenue side or we're going to have to take money out of
infrastructure."

State Rep. Cindy Lerner, D-Miami, complained that some of the
recommendations already are in place as state law or department policy
but
are not followed in full, notably required monthly visits to the 44,000
children in state care.
Democratic state Rep. Frederica Wilson of Miami said she realistically
expected "nothing" to happen in response to the panel's report.

"There's a child missing who could possibly be dead," she said. "I don't
even think that the community awareness has been heightened."

The National Coalition for Child Protection Reform based in Alexandria,
Va., on Monday called the report "nearly 100 percent useless," blaming
Kearney's approach to child welfare in part for an increase in deaths
under
her tenure.

The review panel faulted two low-level state workers and Rilya's
caretakers
for the girl's long-unnoticed disappearance but also said DCF
shortcomings
were "manifest."

Bush said he hopes to see criminal charges come out of police
investigations of allegedly fraudulent reports filed by state employees
and
the caretakers.

Some of the panel's short-term recommendations include photographing
children every three months, having them come to court every six months
and
immediate notification of police when a child is missing. DCF took a
week
to formally report Rilya missing.

Rilya was an infant when she was taken by the state from her homeless,
crack-addicted mother. She was placed with Geralyn Graham, who claims to
be
Rilya's grandmother, and her sister Pamela Graham in April 2000.
Geralyn Graham filed for food stamps on behalf of Rilya as recently as
March. But Graham now says Rilya was taken from her home by someone
purporting to be DCF worker in January 2001.

My Dear Governor Bush: 

In 1977, I lost my Girlfriend, Miss Lauren Rae Wagner. She was kidnapped near her home by two men, Kenneth Bianchi, and Angelo Bueno, who were later dubbed as the Hillside Strangler. There method to gain control of their 16 victims, was to use a Badge in a Wallet and tell the victims, some of who were Prostitutes that they were being arrested. 

The above referenced website actually sells all kinds of Badges and emblems anyone could use to play Policeman. Several are Badges from the FMP, the FHP, the FDLE, several County Sheriff, and City Police Badges. I have even seen advertisement to sell FHP Door Decals and Lightbars. With everything that is going on their in Florida with a run off election in November, you do not need this!

Subject: Film Production

Governer Bush,
I am a very well respected and usually busy Production Manager in the film 
industry in Orlando Florida.  I have a very extensive resume 7 pages long and 
have worked on many well known feature films, tv movies and commercials over 
the last 10 years.  I am also the owner of a local film production company.  
I have not worked on a local Florida commercial in three months.  As for 
feature films and tv, the last film i worked on was in 1999.  As for my 
production company: Ha! Florida keeps giving those jobs to out of towners.  
The lack of film production in this state is a serious issue for so many 
families.  We have lost our careers and livlihoods.   Florida is no longer 
considered a production hub.  Florida seems to be going backward.  I am aware 
of the Canadian incentives that have created runaway production.  However, 
Florida needs to match these financial incentives offered by the Canadians as 
well as other states.  
A bill died in the Legislature this year that would have given producers who 
film in Florida a rebate of up to $2 million on expenditures made in this 
state.  Why did this bill die??  Are you going to step up to the plate and 
move this industry forward so that FLORIDA is again a great place to live and 
work for film professionals?

Jim,
 
   Hello.  There is an article in today's St. Petersburg Times (Wed. May 29, 2002) ,page 13-A 
by columnist Bill Maxwell regarding downtown St. Petersburg's Midtown section.  I thought you might fine this interesting.  It is an effective plan of action for individuals to get involved in their community and show concern for the drug market that is occuring in this area.  It also talks about teaming up 
St. Petersburg Police and Pinellas Co. Sheriff's Dept. to go after drug pushers.
  
   I must say I usually do not agree with Bill Maxwell's articles, but this one is worth reading and applying to help the community.  If you don't get a chance to read this I can mail it to you.
 
Sincerely,
 
Sharon

GOVERNOR BUSH JOINS PRESIDENT AT WHITE HOUSE TO TAKE 
HISTORIC ACTION PROTECTING FLORIDA FROM DRILLING
~~Agreements protect Florida's beaches and the Everglades ~~ 

	WASHINGTON D.C.-- This morning at the White House, President
George
W. Bush made an unprecedented commitment to Florida Governor Jeb Bush,
permanently protecting both Florida's beaches and the Everglades from
oil
and gas drilling.  

Previous environmental protection commitments focused on stopping the
expansion of new oil and gas exploration and development in Florida.
Today's action will actually buy back existing privately-owned and
previously-leased rights to oil and gas interests.  

The President's actions include a negotiated agreement between the
federal
government and five petroleum companies to effectively extinguish all
existing rights to drill just 25 miles off of Florida's northwest coast
near
Pensacola, in an area known as Destin Dome.  This area has long been
recognized as the most likely to see oil and gas development off of
Florida's coast and has been the subject of ongoing federal litigation.

At the same time, the President and Governor announced an agreement for
the
National Park Service to purchase privately held oil and gas rights
within
the Big Cypress National Preserve, the expansive Everglades ecosystem in
South Florida immediately adjacent to Everglades National Park.  These
interests were retained by the Collier family when the Preserve was
established in 1974.  This announcement effectively shuts down any
potential
for new oil rigs in the Everglades.

Today's White House visit by the Governor completes an unparalleled
"Environmental Trifecta" for Florida.

Almost one year ago, the President and Governor revealed a proposal to
make
their respective administrations the first to eliminate plans for any
new
offshore drilling off of Florida's coast.  As a result, the federal
government reduced plans for new oil and gas lease sales off of
Florida's
west coast by 75% -- for the first time ensuring no new development
within a
true 100 mile perimeter off the Florida coast.  Previous administrations
had
acquiesced to drilling in areas less than 100 miles away, west of the
Florida-Alabama state line.

GOVERNOR AND PRESIDENT TAKE HISTORIC ACTION PROTECTING FLORIDA FROM
DRILLING-Page Two

In addition, on January 9, Governor Bush joined President Bush at the
White
House to co-sign, one year ahead of schedule, the first enforceable
agreement to ensure that the Everglades receives all of the clean water
it
will need as restoration progresses in the future.

Today's announcement by the President and Governor builds on these two
historic accomplishments by committing substantial federal resources to
eliminate pre-existing environmental risks to Florida's coastal
resources
and the Everglades.

"The actions we are taking today to preserve Florida's environment are
truly
unprecedented," said Governor Bush.  "Today, thanks to the President's
support, we are reversing the momentum of nearly half a century in
Florida
and guaranteeing the preservation of our environment-based economy and
quality of life."

The negotiated agreement with Chevron, Conoco, Murphy Oil, ExxonMobil
and
Samedan to eliminate existing plans to drill off of Florida's
consistently
top-ranked beaches will cost the federal government approximately $102
million.  The agreement with Collier Resources to prevent the
development of
hydrocarbon resources in the Everglades is valued at approximately
$120-million.

"The President and Governor Bush have negotiated a defining moment in
Florida's environmental history," said the Secretary of Florida's
Department
of Environmental Protection, David Struhs.  "America's best beaches and
America's Everglades are now better protected than ever before for this
and
future generations."

Subject:	Blue Ribbon Panel report!

Florida Leaders,
Just this morning when out for my daily walk with my girlfriend I was sharing 
how excited I was that Florida's failure to invest in the adequate protection 
of our most vulnerable, the children, was now receiving national attention 
and surely immediate action would follow.  

I was so disappointed and dismayed when I got home only to find it front page 
news that a special session was not to be called to address this urgent issue 
even after a very compelling and thorough report from the Blue Ribbon Panel 
(great work for such limited time!).  

As an involved community volunteer who has served on multiple state and local 
boards for organizations that champion children's causes, I am aware that 
there has been some relatively recent improvement in funding for DCF.  I am 
also well aware though that we have unreasonable expectations from a severely 
overburdened system.

I plead that each of you take the time to look deeply into the child 
protective service realities in your community.  Go out with a case worker.  
See first hand the daunting challenges.  There is no doubt in my mind that 
you will come to the same conclusion as this panel did and that is, that in 
addition to some important policy adjustments, more funding will be 
necessary.

These children did not choose to be abused and/or neglected.  How can we 
possibly in good conscience allow this continued suffering?  How many 
children must literally be beaten to death before we consider this a crisis 
situation?  It's sickening.

On behalf of all of the children, we demand action and we demand it now!
thank you for your time and God bless

Subject:	Community Based Program Cut

Dear Governor Bush:

As a long time Board Member of Family Resources, Inc. in Pinellas County 
and an attorney who has dealt with his share of juvenile cases, both 
delinquent and dependent, I have seen programs come and go. 
 Unfortunately it is usually programs that are desperately needed that 
seem to go.

The Family Services Planning Team program along with a number of other
community services are in jeopardy of being cut unless you take action.  
There has been a last minute fund shift in the state budget that was not
discovered until last week.  About $16 MILLION DOLLARS will be transferred from community-based residential and therapeutic services to fund acute institutional services that serve only Medicaid eligible children.  Another $2.5 MILLION has been
cut and shifted to Adult Mental Health services.

Over the years, both the State and providers have worked in partnership to
develop innovative, less restrictive, cost effective, community based
alternatives to institutional care.  This whole system is at risk.  Many
children and families are in great need of these community-based
interventions and most if not all of these services will be lost if this
line item is not vetoed by you.

Please veto this item and don't take us back 20 years in the past as I have seen happen so many times with services to children and families.

Thank you for your time.

Re change in control / $$:  Many things are under discussion, and all

we can make it happen and make you, the State and the Playhouse all
winners. 

My personal vision is marketing the Playhouse (national level
productions, employing local as well as internationally recognized
actors) to bring  investment $$ and good publicity into the State.
Let's cut through the misunderstandings between Miami/Tallahassee that
have developed over years. Guessing what each other wants does not work.
 Will you be in South Florida in next week or so?  We'd meet at dawn, at
midnight, whenever.  If not, we'll fly up.  Tell us your specific

 I promise I'll make it happen the way you want and personally follow

The Playhouse is in discussions with he Secretary of State's office to acquire the property and is awaiting instructions as to how to proceed.  The Playhouse is developing a plan with the City of Miami Department of Off Street Parking and the Coconut Grove Arts Festival for utilizaqtion of the surrounding property to benefit the citizens of South Florida.  I support appropriation item number 3130A that provides for operating funding to the Playhouse in the amount of $500,000, which has been a part of the statute for several years.  As not only a Miami-Dade County resident, but also as a fifteen year resident and the current Chairman of the Board of Trustees for The Coconut Grove playhouse, I feel the Playhouse is one of the cultural jewels in our state.

Dear Mr. Bush,
As a parent of a child getting ready to enter school in Osceola County I have been doing a lot of research on the quality and availability of schools.  I have found that there is a lack of funds for the schools to be able to get the students out of portables and into a constructed building, have quality programs and facilities, adequate pay for qualified teachers, and to keep the student/teacher ratio around 25 to 1.  With a growing community like Osceola County we are in dire need of funds not only to accommodate all of the families living here now but the growing amount of children that are moving into Osceola County.  Please approve the State Legislature approved $10 million fund to help fast growing counties.

Just checking if you received this letter in its original hardcopy format with attachments before.


April 26, 2002

The Honorable Governor Jeb Bush
Executive Offices of the Governor
The Capitol, Tallahassee, FL 32399-0001

Honorable Governor, Dear Jeb:

After our visit with you in your Carol Gable office in May '96 Mr. Ralph Bistany and I have been watching your success as Governor and FL education pioneer and reformer. We are proud of our tiny part in supporting you from the start.

With the attached material I wanted to update you briefly about our own success in the charter school arena. It basically describes our US rollout model in Springfield, MA, which Margery Hemsing-Rankin visited in November '96.

It particularly highlights the successes of disadvantaged Hispanic students. Here is my question and modest request:

Could you or your office help us with any contacts or recommendations in a Latin American country? We would like to acquire or establish a private (or public) school with a residential section for seamless student and teacher exchanges within an identical and proven SABIS® curriculum and instructional system. As you know better than most people, English proficiency for Hispanics and Spanish knowledge for all US citizens is so very vital for individual and our entire society's future wellbeing. That's why all our charter school students take Spanish from Kindergarten on.

Your consideration and advice would be much appreciated.

Best wishes and regards,

AUDUBON PRAISES PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH & GOVERNOR JEB BUSH ON ENDING OIL DRILLING THREAT


May 29, 2002, Miami, Florida-Audubon of Florida praised the commitment made by today by President Bush George W. Bush in response to the Governor Jeb Bush and State of Florida's longstanding opposition to oil drilling near the environmentally fragile coastal estuaries. Audubon also applauds the proposed acquisition of mineral rights to halt oil drilling in the Everglades Ecosystem.

The agreement was negotiated by the federal government and several oil companies to remove existing rights to drill 25 miles off of Florida's northwest coast near Pensacola, an area known as the Destin Dome.  

In addition, the federal government will purchase privately owned mineral rights within three environmental sensitive areas of the greater Everglades ecosystem: The Big Cypress National Preserve, the Florida Panther National Wildlife Refuge and the Ten Thousand Island National Wildlife Refuge. The agreement mandates that the National Park Service will purchase the rights form the Collier family, which currently owns the rights.  Today's announcement precludes any potential new oil & gas exploration in the Everglades.  "This is a major step forward in protecting the Big Cypress and the Greater Everglades Ecosystem. Oil drilling was reluctantly accepted as a compromise when the Big Cypress Preserve was created by Congress 28 years ago, and finally bringing it to an end will significantly reduce the possibility of endangered habitat from being negatively impacted by gas and oil extraction", said Dr. Stuart Strahl, Audubon of Florida's CEO & President.

"Audubon and its chapters have long opposed drilling in Florida's nearshore coastal waters," Strahl continued, "The leadership shown by the President and Governor Bush in removing the threat of drilling from the Destin Dome is great news to all Floridians who care about the health of our estuaries and coastal waters", he concluded.

Purchase of the Big Cypress Mineral Rights will require congressional action, either to appropriate cash, or exchange rights for other mineral interests. Audubon is committed to assure that the outcome of such congressional action will take place while protecting all sensitive environmental resources.

Dear Governor:
    Please Veto HB 1307.         You can't just not sign the bill, we will never get back our access, it 
has to be a Veto. We will have time to be involved in the process. It was not 
fair the way we were kept ignorant of the amendment until we knew too little, 
too late. It is not fair to the people to loose 80% accessibility in existing 
buildings. It is not fair to the building owners-increased liability and law 
suits for denial of access to goods and services and jobs.
    Under current law, Florida builds once, we build it right, and it is 
accessible to all people. There are no problems. With your signature, they 
only have to pay 20% of the cost of construction for "us". Construction cost 
is segregated, we are valued at 20%. It is wrong. We cannot get a job on a 
second floor with no lift. We will cost taxpayers more money. We will not 
spend our money on the second floor with no lift, bad for Florida business. 
    ADA encourages a state to be stronger in accessibility depending on the 
needs of it's population. We are a host state. We need. We are a retirement 
state. We need. We are a state with a high voting population of people with 
disabilities. We need. We have stronger laws - this amendment takes away our 
strength. Don't let it happen, give us a chance to defend our laws-Veto 
HB1307, they will invariably try again next year, but it will be a fair 
fight. Nothing is lost with the Veto, people's lives are irreversibly changed 
with it. Veto on HB1307 = Strong Florida.
With thanks and blessings,
Angel Watson

We are looking for assurance that our Florida Statutes listing our more 
stringent accessibility laws were not changed, amended, altered, deleted
or defaulted to Federal Code in any way. We need to know that no one has 
changed the privileges and rights afforded to Floridians that we worked so 
hard for. Please veto HB 1307. 



This bill was totally designed to benefit no one other than builders
and developers.  What little good there is in it is far outweighed by
the bad!

Dear Governor Bush: 

Thank you for the quality time you spent with me and the rest of the Save-A-Friend group last week.  Although I regret to say that I did not fully appreciate it at the time, I cannot adequately express how valuable your input was.  Following our meeting, and throughout this past week, the Save-A-Friend team went back to the drawing board and modified the program so that it can work on a state-by-state basis.  In fact, the program may even work better given the realities of the governmental/political structures we have to interact with. 

Of course, we would like Florida to be the first state and for you to be at the forefront once the program is in place and has demonstrated its effectiveness.  There is no question in my mind, Governor, given my many years of experience, that this program works and will work for Florida! 

I would like to keep you updated as we continue to fine-tune the program to better fit a state-by-state approach.  In fact, the Save-A-Friend group would very much appreciate the opportunity, in the near future, to again meet with you and brief you on the modified program, prior to us also presenting it to Education Commissioner Charlie Christ and key members of the state legislature, as you suggested. 

Incidentally, with your permission, the Florida plan will include all state two and four year colleges in addition to K-12.   

Once again, thank you for your interest and feedback. 

Best Wishes,

Subject:	A Rant on Education Privatization

Jeb,

My house is located in a rural area of Riverside County. When my family moved into the neighborhood, we had to decide who would pick up our trash every week. There were seven different trash haulers. We asked the neighbors which company they recommended and we picked one. We had to provide our own trashcans and every week our trash was picked up. We didn't spend much time thinking about our trash service. Then two years ago Riverside County decided this was too confusing for residents. They "competitively" bid out the countywide trash collection and selected a trash hauler for all the residents in the county. The new trash company gave residents new trash bins and recycle bins. But the company consistently "forgets" to pick up our recyclables. Sometimes 3-4 weeks have gone by without the recycle truck coming out to our house. They rarely keep to their collection schedule. We have complained to the company. We have complained to the county. But unless the company fails on a grand scale it is unlikely anything will change. Perhaps in four more years when the contract is up, the county will have another competitive bid and select a different trash hauler. I liked it better when we could choose between the seven companies serving our neighborhood. 

But this is a minor problem compared with the government-run school in my neighborhood. Today I went to http://www.greatschools.net to see how the school that my kids will never set foot in was doing and to confirm the fatal flaw (for parents like me) in the No Child Left Behind act (NCLB). I quickly confirmed three facts I already knew about my neighborhood school: 

1. Overall Test Score Performance: Below Average--This school has a rank of 4 out of 10 on the 2001 Academic Performance Index. 

2. Performance Compared to Similar Schools: Well Below Average--This school has a rank of 2 out of 10 compared to similar schools. 

3. Test Score Improvement: Met Its Improvement Targets.  

Here's the flaw: my school is "below average" or "well below average" depending on which measure you use as a benchmark, yet it is meeting California's low requirements for adequate yearly performance (AYP). As far as the NCLB act is concerned my school is improving. This school will never be labeled a failing school and there will never be a right of exit for students who do not want to attend a "below average" or "well below average" but not "failing" school. In twenty years, give or take a decade, this school might meet California's target of 800 points on the Academic Performance Index. Students at this school and other schools in my district will never even receive the extra reading-tutoring voucher that kids at failing schools will get. And these kids need some extra reading help. My school district has an average of 48 percent of students scoring above the 50th percentile on the Stanford 9 in reading.  

The education situation in my neighborhood is more critical than the poor-performing trash collector. Unless parents can afford to "buy" their way out, they will be stuck with low performance for a long time. Unlike the poor-performing trash collector, El Cerrito Elementary's contract will most likely never run out.

This is why education privatization is better than the status quo. It introduces some accountability into the system. An education service provider, like Edison, has a contract with actual requirements for performance. And when they fail to meet those performance measures everyone hears about it and some districts or schools cancel their contract. That's the point, and it shows privatization works better than the status quo.

But this minor improvement over the status quo should never be confused with a real education market with competition and choice. The media confuses the two all the time.  Take this sentence from the Financial Times last week covering the Philadelphia school privatization: "The plan marks the biggest trial of school privatisation, the controversial approach that pits advocates of public education against free-market reformers."  

Privatization is usually equated with a free-market in the press and by most education reform activists. Yet, privatization is only a poor proxy for competition in education. Even when a school is privatized, that school does not face a true market test. The kids that go to the privatized school in Philadelphia, for example, will be the same kids who went to the public school last year.  And if Edison or their counterparts fail, then those same families will send their kids to the next government-selected school the next year. The parents never exercise choice and the schools, whether private or public, are not threatened by the right of exit of the school children they serve.  

While Edison and other education service providers are arguably more responsive than the public school providers, ultimately the government agency and not the parent is their customer.

When I think of this dilemma, I remember two speeches I heard back to back at the Association of Education Practitioners and Providers conference last summer at USC.  Chris Whittle gave a speech on Edison's model of national schooling companies and economies of scale. Jack Clegg, the CEO of Nobel Learning Communities, gave a speech on why public education needs a new heart made up of school choice, where parents pick the school that most fits their child's needs.  At the time I thought it was striking how the themes in the speeches matched the companies'  business models. Chris Whittle has tried to go national by wooing large school districts and ramping up several schools at a time based on government contracts to run multiple schools. Jack Clegg, on the other hand, has grown by attracting parents to his schools--one school at a time.  Guess which company's stock has a higher value? Guess which company is meeting the market test without a government sanction?

Now don't get me wrong, I work for a think tank that has advocated privatization for thirty years. Just last week the Financial Times called me a "pro-privatisation advocate."  I applaud Edison. I'm impressed they have lasted this long in the brutal world of labor negotiations and government contracts. The recent Gray Davis/ California Teachers Association brouhaha proves that teacher's unions eat their own kind. And as Checker Finn said yesterday in an editorial in his Education Gadfly about Edison, "Never forget that the teacher unions HATE Edison and the other EMO's and are doing their best to subvert and bankrupt all such ventures. . . . they so look forward to dancing on its grave."


I applaud Chris Whittle and find it fascinating that Edison has lasted this long.  They have, partly because they have a superior product, and when the product is well implemented and the contract goes their way, student achievement goes up. Ultimately though, this is a poor proxy for real competition and choice. In a real free market system, Edison wouldn't need a well-written contract to ensure that they could properly implement their business model. Instead, they would need customers that were willing to support their model and enroll their children.  

When school districts, school boards, or state governments choose an education service provider, it is no different than the city choosing your trash hauler or your cable service. If you have a complaint, you are at the mercy of the government agency that selected the provider. Likewise, if you like Edison, and the school board does not (think San Francisco), you are still at the mercy of the government agency.  Either way the government is still choosing.

I can't hire a trash company that actually picks up my trash and I can't find a local government school that can teach my kids to read. But at least with the school situation, I can pay a private school in downtown Riverside, The Growing Place, to teach my kids to read. The law prevents me from hiring a different trash hauler. Things could be worse. And for many kids, things are worse.


Thanks for your continued support of Reason's education program.

Jeb

The Palm Bay Chamber of Commerce is introducing Mr. Burlew and his
technology students at their June 5 luncheon to introduce and honor them .
I thought perhaps this may be of interest to you as an opportunity to
promote more business partnerships for our schools and students,
internships, mentorship's and support of technology education programs such
as the one at Palm Bay High School and other schools across the great State
of Florida.  I know these are all educational initiatives you support and
like to promote. I understand it is not a lot of notice and you are very
busy--but it would be a nice time and opportunity to both honor these
students and promote business and educational partnerships at the same time.

You know I appreciate any consideration and sincerely want to help you
promote your positive and forward thinking educational initiatives.

Mr. Hank Simon is the President of The Palm Bay Chamber and his number is
321.951.9998

The Palm Bay Chamber Luncheon is June 5 at the Ramada Inn on Palm Bay Road

Mr. Burlews home number is 321.632.8259.

Subject: Memorial Weekend Crash Fatality Stats


The 2002 Memorial Day Preliminary Traffic Fatality Report indicates a dramatic reduction in highway deaths from the previous holiday period in 2001.  The 2002 preliminary total stands at 15 deaths, which is a 57 percent decrease from the preliminary 35 deaths that occurred in 2001.  Attached is a preliminary fatality report.

This dramatic reduction can be attributed to several factors.  Currently, the Florida Highway Patrol, along with the rest of Florida's law enforcement community, is aggressively participating in the Click It or Ticket  campaign that continues through June 2, 2002.  This media blitz and zero tolerance approach regarding seat belt and child restraint violations will prove that using the vehicle's occupant protection system will save lives.  

Colonel Chris Knight also instructed all personnel who are regularly assigned to administrative duties to work the road this past holiday period, thus increasing visibility.  The FHP also continues with its Statewide Overtime Activity Reporting program.  This program allows troopers to work an additional 24 hours of overtime within a 40-hour workweek.  

At the last Cabinet meeting, Attorney General Butterworth asked about the percentage of crash fatalities that were not buckled up.  In 2001, there were 2,081 fatalities in seat belt equipped vehicles.  Of those, 1,325 were not buckled up, or 64 percent.  This is an improvement from year 2000 in which 68 percent were not buckled up.

Governor,

Thanks for the reply!  I will work with your staff to schedule the "vision"
brief. This is something I have been working on....before the appointment
and certainly since. 

We are about where I wanted to be at the "six months" point..."functional
area review" of each Directorate, moving us off the bottom of the matrix for
many areas evaluated by the Guard Bureau and active Army. NOTE: We were at
the top of the "big stuff", just not engaged on the support mechanism that
can "bite you". We have the "money" concerns under control with solid
accountability for activity.

I strongly feel we are functioning as a team. General Watson and I had an
"off site" meeting of a few hours four weeks ago. I don't like those type
meetings, but this one was necessary.  I can report he now appears to be
solidly on board and is functioning as a very good "wingman". I am adding
more authority and responsibility to his position. He is a talented guy,
just needed a little motivation to support what is a very aggressive vision
for the future.  It was time for him to get over the personal issue and work
at the levels required.

Best regards,

Doug

Governor,

Below is a news release concerning our soldiers arrival at Ft. Stewart, GA.
The major training exercise is underway.  The convoy movements went very
well.  I have appointed Gen Watson as the Multi-State Task Force Commander
and am pleased to report that he is doing quite well. His tactical
perspective is well known.

We had significant problems Friday night getting 22 train cars of Abrams
Tanks and Armored Personnel Carriers through the "switch" at Waycross, GA. I
called Mr. Jeff Crowe of Landstar Corp who put me in touch with the senior
leadership at CSX railroad.   CSX did everything we needed...made it happen
and the tanks arrived in time for the exercise.

I just spoke at a Memorial Day service....reminded the attendees of the
superior job being done by our President and that "help has arrived".

Best personal regards to the Commander-in-Chief on Memorial Day.

I have contacted Charlie Crist's office and have not received a call back.
I have spoken with Diane McCain and Lt. Governor Brogan's office to see if they can help us. On May 17, 2002 I was suppose to pick up our check from the Orange County Public Schools, but they didn't have one for Cyber.  The teachers were suppose to get paid on the 22nd of May.They have withheld the entire FTE funds, capital outlay, and grant funds. I explained that our teachers need to get paid but they denied the request. I am asking for assistance from the state.   I have to inform the staff what we can do to get their funds released. These teachers have families and it is critical we get these funds released.
On behalf of Cyber High Staff, I would appreciate whatever you can do to assist us.

Florida First Lady, Columba Bush, and Wyoming First Lady, Sherri Geringer, embrace on Wednesday in Jackson at the Third Annual Alcohol Education Showcase where they spoke on the far-reaching negative impact of underage drinking. Mrs. Bush and Mrs. Geringer are promoting the First Spouses Initiative - a partnership of 36 current and former First Spouses throughout the United States taking steps to prevent underage alcohol use.

Sherri Geringer hosts Florida First Lady Columba Bush at alcohol education conference in Jackson

JACKSON, WY - First Ladies from states separated by thousands of miles stood arm in arm on Wednesday in Jackson to discuss the debilitating and often tragic consequences of underage drinking.

Sherri Geringer hosted Florida First Lady Columba Bush at the Third Annual Alcohol Education Showcase which brought together about 150 people representing law enforcement, schools, and community activists. The attendees gathered to strategize on battling the rising tide of underage drinking in Wyoming where reports indicate one-third of the state's high school seniors engage in binge drinking during any two week period.

"The fact is, it's illegal for anyone under the age of 21 to drink any alcoholic beverages," said Geringer. "But the law is not enough. Adults have to get involved so we can shake this cultural attitude that drinking is just another rite of passage."

Bush said that she informs Florida's youth about the dangers of alcohol and drug abuse by visiting at least two schools every month throughout the state as well as delivering the message to prevention programs and community events.

"Our children are in need of a positive message," Bush said. "Life is too important to let alcohol and other forms of substance abuse interfere with their studies, their happiness, and their futures."

The deaths of the eight University of Wyoming students at the hands of drunk driver Clinton Haskins - who was sentenced for the crime earlier this week - was at the surface of much of the conference dialogue in Jackson.

"Last September, eight U.W. students were killed by a drunk and driving ninth student," Geringer said. "This was an act of violence unprecedented in our state's history - and a cultural failure for Wyoming. Law enforcement records show how many times Clinton Haskins was caught driving drunk before the incident, but no records exist on how many times he was not caught, or how young he was when he took his first drink, or how many times someone looked the other way when his drinking was out of control."

"How many 15- to 20-year olds were drinking that night?," she asked. "And how many others engaged in risky behavior? How much potential was lost that Saturday night in our state?"

The Leadership to Keep Children Alcohol Free brings public awareness to the issue of preventing early alcohol use by 9- to 15- year old kids. Geringer is a member of the Leadership Committee of the national initiative launched two years ago that involves 36 current and former governor's spouses. 

Diane Galloway, the substance abuse administrator for the Wyoming Department of Health said that over $4.4 million in grant funding will be available to Wyoming communities this fall. The grant announcement will be made on June 6 and those interested should call 800-536-4006.

The event was sponsored by the Wyoming Department of Health Substance Abuse Division and funded by a grant from the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.

Subject: Nanny Bill/Educational System/


 
Dear Jeb, (PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS…VERY IMPORTANT!!!!)
 
We are extremely disappointed that you actually signed the Nanny Bill into law. You have helped to create a new monster that is even more devastating to Florida families than our current corrupt Social Services organization. I hope you will remember this when the horror stories start hitting the media…and believe me, it’s gonna hit the fan, and you will be responsible for the ensuing mess.
 
In fact, we are extremely disappointed that our government officials are so very uneducated in the area of child raising altogether. The public school system is an absolute shame and more money, all the money in the world, will not fix it. Teaching methods are still being used that were put in place at the turn of the LAST century, over 100 years ago. Except that now, rather than teaching the three R’s, the schools are teaching our children that it’s OK to be gay, there is no wrong and right, there are only gray areas…something called “humanism”, and basically destroying families in their wake of destruction. What’s going on in today’s public schools is like something in a Frank Peretti book…the devil is busier these days…time is definitely very short.
 
Are you aware that America’s school system was based on that of the German’s, with the goal of “educating” their people for factory work? The same system is still in place today in this country. Sure, add a few computers and you can call it “modernizing” our schools, but it doesn’t change the fact that public schools are failing SO MANY people…yep, kids are people…and that no amount of money will fix things. Until kids have a reason to want to learn, and until education is offered in a way that kids want it, the system will continue to degrade into further despair. What do you, yourself, learn today that someone is making you learn? I’ll bet you enjoy learning about things your WANT to learn about, are interested in…why should it be any different for our kids??? Compulsory attendance needs to be completely removed from education. Through thousands of years, it has been a known fact that making a kid do anything only leads to resentment and a big fight…remember how it was/is with your kids? How many times have you heard, “You can’t tell me what to do!!”?
 
And we’re sick to death of hearing about “testing”…more testing…it’s the cart before the horse. What is important, children learning or taking tests, being taught based on tests, being taught how to take tests? How many tests have you taken as an adult, Jeb? Why are the children in this country being taught to take tests? Tests don’t measure their true intelligence…tests simply determine how good they are at taking tests. Most kids know an awful lot of stuff that just isn’t on a test…it doesn’t mean they’re stupid and definitely not learning disabled. Research has shown, time after time, that after high schoolers have crammed for finals, even the ones who ace the tests forget most of the material within 9 weeks post-testing. What did they learn? To pass a test. Is this learning, real learning? ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!!! Real learning sticks with you forever, like riding a bike…you never forget.
 
Case and point – When our son was in the third and sixth grades, he was tested for learning disabilities. Both times he tested above average, very high in language skills, yet his teachers didn’t think he would ever amount to much, oh, and they said he was very disorganized. We pulled both our kids out of school at the end of our son’s sixth grade year and our daughter at the end of fourth grade to home school. Last year, our son graduated a year and a half early with a 3.52 GPA. He was immediately hired to be the “computer brain” for a locally based missionary organization, New Missions, who serve in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. One of the founders’ sons hired Justin after watching him in his volunteer work at Orlando  <http://www.orlandometro.com/> Metro, a Bible Study meeting that takes place at First Baptist of Orlando <http://www.firstorlando.com/> , a church that seats 10,000 people and has a very large media system. Justin is the youngest person to ever operate the computerized lighting system at that church and he learned the system and worked it solo after just six short weeks (that’s six nights) of observing the church’s Lighting Director. Justin became Metro’s Lighting Director for the next year, until the Metro Director decided he was better suited to help run the whole thing and promoted him to Leadership. Justin then created a Communications Team and headed it up for nearly a year…all before he turned 18 years old. Remember, Jeb…his teachers said he’d never amount to anything…was disorganized... We couldn’t be more proud of him!!! Justin’s employers are in awe that he “just soaks this technology stuff up like a sponge.” Justin was never learning disabled and neither are most of the kids that get labeled with that “loser” term.
 
Jeb, the public schools are in a desperate state. Government leaders need to get educated on what real learning is and should be…if they’re truly concerned about what kind of people will be “running the show” twenty years down the road.
 
There’s a short video that would be great for you to see…it’s only 59 minutes in length, yet contains so much about this country’s history, including education. It’s called, “America’s Godly Heritage” by David Barton. David Barton is founder of WallBuilders <http://www.wallbuilders.com/> , an organization dedicated to the restoration and rebuilding of the values on which America was built and which, in recent years, have been seriously undermined. As stated by George Washington, David believes that “the propitious [favorable] smiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation which disregards the eternal rules of order and right which heaven itself has ordained.” You can order the video here - http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-form/103-7377467-0293448. It would be well worth your time to view it, at least once. My family has received a great blessing from watching it, as well as confirmation on what we know is wrong with the public school system and why we removed our children from its fatal grasp…yes, fatal…schools are killing children’s natural curiosity and natural inclinations to learn.
 
One other wonderful educational tool (one of many) is the book, “In Their Own Way” by Dr. Thomas Armstrong. Research has shown that there are seven known intelligences, or learning styles:
 
1.	Linguistic Intelligence 

2.	Logical-Mathematical Intelligence 

3.	Spatial Intelligence 

4.	Musical Intelligence 

5.	Bodily-Kinesthetic Intelligence (these are the kids who just can’t sit still in school, and shouldn’t be) 

6.	Interpersonal Intelligence 

7.	Intrapersonal Intelligence 
 
Schools only address #1 and #2. The rest of the kids either find a way to muddle through or get stamped learning disabled. Very interesting, don’t ya think? I’ll bet you just learned something new…read the book for more great stuff!
 
We’re very sorry for Florida families who will be subjected to the Learning Gateway/Nanny Bill. We’re very thankful that we won’t be having any more children under this kind of oppression but we will continue to work in defense of young couples who want to start families under this new regime. It’s like we’re going backwards, back into the middle ages, with this lack of knowledge and removal of freedoms and rights that were presumed safe in the USA…it’s a grim future.
 
Most Sincerely,

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I understand that CS/HB 1341 is due for your consideration tomorrow.  I would like to restate our support for this legislation.
 
The counties sought the legislation to address problems that we are seeing at the local level, particularly with regard to the formation of new CRAs.  The present law allows a CRA to be formed solely if there is "inadequate parking," which I think you will agree would allow a CRA to be formed in many areas of the state which would not be considered "blighted areas" in any other manner.  In addition, present law sets a subjective standard for whether the proposed CRA constitutes a threat to the public health, safety and welfare.  The legislation addresses these statutory deficiencies, and requires that in order for a new CRA to be formed that there be substantial findings of "blighted area" based on objective and specific criteria.  The addition of more objective criteria will help ensure that the public purpose intended for CRAs will be served.
 
In addition, the bill grandfathers existing CRAs from the new requirements unless they propose to expand their boundaries.   The bill represents a compromise reached after substantial discussion with all interested parties.  Furthermore, if the bill does not become law, we anticipate the formation of many new CRAs between now and the time the Legislature returns, which could have a substantial, negative, and long-term impact on county finances.
 
Please contact me if you have any concerns about the bill.

Querido Jeb:
Te pido un favor. En Venevision Internacional soy Asesor General, título
pomposo
para mi poco o ningún mando.  Promuevo la imagen de la empresa, la
menciono en
los actos en que intervengo -ahora estoy muy de moda- y he traído a
almorzar a
Alex Penelas, Raúl Martínez, Manny Díaz y otros, a las oficinas del
Edificio de
los Leones, 550 Biltmore Way, Coral Gables, Piso 11. para que les
expliquen las
actividades de la empresa.
Venevisión Internacional pertenece a la Organización Cisneros, es una
coporación
norteamericana, distribuye filmes en español con títulos en inglés en
EEUU, hace
presentaciones teatrales  y produce programas de televisión para
Univisión los
que también vende en Latinoamérica, Europa y Asia, en un gran total de
102
países.
Luis Villanueva, Presidente de VV Internacional, me ha pedido que lo
ayude a
saludarte; en una visita que hagas a Miami, o en un almuerzo en estas
oficinas,
o en visita que hagamos a Tallahassee. Como Villanueva viaja bastante,
en el
caso de tú acceder a esta solicitud- te agradeceríamos una anticipación
de la
fecha.
Esta gestión no conlleva propósito alguno comercial, político o de
cualquier
índole lucrativa.  Sólo el honor para Villanueva de conversar con
alguien de tu
jerarquía y al que admira.

PUNTO Y APARTE

Te agradecería mayor contacto conmigo. Creo que debes ampliar el radio
de acción
en tus visitas a Miami.
En cuanto a la visita de W a Miami, duele enterarse por los alardes de
otros que
se dicen enterados, habiendo el Partido Ortodoxo Cubano y yo:

1- Enviado más Delegados que todos al Victory Party en Orlando. Pregunta
a Al
Cárdenas. Prometí personalmente a W 40 delegados. Los duplicamos.
2- Entregado las llaves del Condado Miami-Dade a W en circunstancias
especiales
que después rindieron grandes frutos.
3- Redactado la resolución de apoyo a W por la Delegación de LULAC en
Florida.
Fue controversial, atrajo votos hispanos y W se reunió con nosotros..
4 -Escrito y publicado el mayor número de artículos sobre W en la
campaña
presidencial.
5- Merecido por esta campaña una carta manuscrita de W.
6- Peleado hasta con los puños para que el conteo de votos fuera justo.

Gracias por la atención que me prestes. El primer punto es mi trabajo y
tu ayuda
me ayuda. El segundo es mi corazón.

PRESS RELEASE

Governor Bush has until tomorrow at 5:0 PM to veto HB 1307, which has a
late file evil and wicked amendment in the bill.

Rep. Cantens was asked to recall the bill and strip the bad amendment.
He declined to do this. We, people with disabilities across the state
have been seeking a veto of this bill that violates the wording of the
AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT (ada). This actual wording is posted at
www.dignity4disabled.com, in an item entitled  "Gov Bush,
Veto HB 1307.

To date no media coverage in South Florida has discussed this offensive
bill, that the disabled statewide are trying to get a VETO from the
Governor. Hopefully, some editor
or reporters will cover this issue so that other people with
disabilities can know about
another roll back of their laws that affect their access to second
floors.

Dear Governor Bush:

I am writing as a member of the Workforce Florida, Inc., Board of Directors,
an appointment I accepted from you in July of 2000.

Florida law indicates that your appointees to the WFI Board serve for
two-year terms and that the Governor has authority to re-appoint existing
members upon completion of their terms.  The purpose of this e-mail is to
let you know that I would like to be re-appointed to the Board for another
two-year term, beginning in July of this year.

I believe the past two years have been very productive and successful for
Workforce Florida, Inc., under the careful and sage guidance of Chairman
Toni Jennings, and they've also been both challenging and rewarding for me
personally.  My service on the Board has allowed me to follow through on my
protracted involvement in reforming Florida's workforce development system,
which I began as a representative of the business community with the Florida
Chamber of Commerce.

My commitment to improving Florida's workforce system has become an ongoing
responsibility that continues to this day.  I would be very happy to
continue my service as a member of the WFI Board.

I have delivered this message to your office at the Capitol as an actual
letter, which I have copied to your Appointments Office so that I might be
provided with instructions for establishing myself as eligible for
re-appointment.  I can be reached by voice at 224-1585, fax at 222-0398, or
email at abrown@carltonfields.com.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.  I look forward to hearing from
you at your convenience.  Please contact me if I can ever assist you in any
way.

Sincerely,
G. Allen Brown, Jr.,

Governor Bush-

I recently spoke with Barbara Wilcox, my (favorite) aunt, asking her
advice
with an issue and she suggested I contact you to ask for your
assistance.
Just within the last 48 hours it has become obvious that time is of the
essence.

I have lived in Pinellas County and boated in the Gulf waters for over
20
years.  There are a number of islands which are part of the Gulf Islands
Geo
Parks System that many boaters visit and enjoy.  We (the boaters) have
peacefully co-existed with the various animals and shorebirds since
nature
created these islands.

Recently the Parks Department has begun to actively regulate and
restrict
our usage basing their actions on unsubstantiated data.  Signs have
appeared
"overnight" and law enforcement has begun patrolling the islands.  At
issue
are NO pets, NO overnight camping, NO camp fires, NO alcohol, NO
overnight
anchoring close to some of the islands.

"S.O.S." or Save Our Sandbar, a grass roots group of boaters was formed
to
explore the validity of the Parks claiming and enforcing jurisdiction on
the
islands.  As a result of group members contacting our elected officials
and
attending local government meetings a proposal was offered by the Parks
Department which we interpreted as a starting point for resolution to
this
issue. Discussion of the proposal was the main item on the agenda of our
May
22nd meeting.

In addition to a lawyer S.O.S. has retained to advise us on our options,
two
representatives from the Parks Department were at the meeting.  Since we
were to discuss our legal and non-legal options, the two gentlemen were
asked to leave.  I was in ear shot of the entire conversation and once
the
situation was explained, the two men left -it was all very amicable.
 
The very next morning the Fish & Wildlife Department showed up on the
North
Anclote Sandbar, erected signs and roped off a fairly large portion of
the
island.  They also informed boaters anchored there that this weekend
(Memorial Day) they would be heavily patrolling and enforcing the
restrictions.

Whether the actions of the Fish & Wildlife Department were in
retaliation of
the Parks Department representatives being asked to leave, who knows.
But I
fear this is going to escalate into something big and ugly...FAST.  Egos
are
taking over and emotions are starting to run high and unfortunately
those at
the extreme ends of this issue are going to push this past negotiating
and
into the courts.

I know you are an extremely busy man (oh, and thanks for keeping our
phone
bills down) but this issue cuts to the very core of citizens' rights to
enjoy where we have chosen to live and recreate.  Any intervention or
assistance on your part would be immensely appreciated.

Dear Governor:

My name is Harold Wheeler and I am the Director of the Monroe County Tourist 
Development Council.  I am sorry that we have not officially met before, but I 
assure you that I am a supporter of yours and your administration.  I have met 
your brother when he was running for Governor of Texas for the first time at a 
fund raiser on South Padre Island, Texas. I was the Executive Director of the 
CVB on South Padre Island at the time.  President Bush has brought a level of 
patriotism back to this country that we haven't seen in a long while and I am 
proud of his Presidency.  I have also met and been with your father a number of 
times at the George Bush/Cheeca Lodge Bonefish Tournament in Islamorada.  We 
are a major sponsor of the tournament.

Now that I have set some kind of familiarity, please let me get to the point of 
writing you personally.  Monroe County, which represents all the Florida Keys 
and part of the Everglades National Park on the mainland, is an important co  
mponent of the Florida tourism program.  We are among the top in tourist 
development tax revenue collections in the State.  We also were one of the 
founding members of the Visit Florida partnership program. Our County and 
myself, feel very strongly that we should have representation on the Florida 
Commission on Tourism.  There are six (6) positions within our Southeastern 
region and there is no one from the Florida Keys.  I would ask that you 
consider my name to represent Monroe County on the Commission.  The Commission 
plays an important role on the direction in which tourism promotion is 
developed in Florida and I believe I can bring something to the table or I 
wouldn't ask for the appointment.

I appreciate your time and your consideration.  Thank you very much.

On another note, Rodney Barreto wanted me to bring up a request that you

Dear Katie Muniz,

I work for BBC television's Newsnight programme and am currently the
team's
interview producer.  Newsnight is the premier current affairs programme
each
evening providing in-depth analysis of events here in the UK but also
across
the world.  

We have been broadcasting the programme for twenty two years now and
have
won many awards for our journalism and interviewing.  Our programmes are
watched by an influential and opinion leading audience.

We have the flexibility to broadcast a range of reports, interview
profiles
and live discussions. Here are some examples of the longer interviews we
have done recently: US secretary of State Colin Powell, who chose
Newsnight
for his only UK interview; Nelson Mandela; Shimon Peres; Pascal Lamy;
Chris
Patten and UN commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, and this
month
the Prime Minister Tony Blair recorded a series of interviews to mark
his
fifth anniversary in power.

I understand that Governor Bush will be visiting the UK around the 24th
July.  We would be very keen to record an interview with him, broadly
about
US-Anglo relations post September 11th.

We would need about fifteen minutes of his time and could either
pre-record
the interview at his convenience or interview him live in the studio.

I would appreciate it if you could bring this request to Governor Bush's
attention.

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions, my
numbers
are below.

With best wishes

" Jeb Bush said it's for others to determine "which side wins out" in
Alaska.  "I'm governor of Florida. You know, Alaska is a wonderful place but it's a little cold for me."

FYI-  On August 7 Carole and I are headed for the Nigu River on the North Slope of Alaska, just above the Brooks Range for a 10 day raft trip to the Arctic Ocean. We will sleep on the tundra in a tent each night, and the "air conditioning" will be entirely natural! (August is clearly the month to do this!)

The route of much of this trip is going through a Bureau of Land Management territory called the "National Petroleum Reserve". This is about 150 miles west of the disputed site of proposed drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

Oh, the irony!

Vic,
In the 2001 Session, the Legislature passed CS/CS/HB 1193, which required
school districts to treat years of teaching experience outside the district
the same as years of teaching experience within the district, for purposes
of pay.  The district school board was required to recognize and accept each
year of full-time teaching service for which the employee received a
satisfactory performance evaluation.  The provision was not intended to
interfere with collective bargaining except to the extent it required the
agreement to treat years of teaching experience out of the district the same
as years of teaching experience within the district. The provision did not
apply to a retired teacher from the Florida system coming back to work.  The
provision did not apply to teacher already employed in a district, but only
to those teachers who were entering into contracts with district in which
they were not employed as of June 30, 2001. (s. 231.36(3)(g), F.S.)

This year in the School Code Rewrite bill, SB 20-E, which passed during
Session 2002-E, the language was clarified.  Teaching experience must have
been in a public school but can be either in the state of Florida or outside
the state.  The language "not intended to interfere in collective bargaining
agreement" was eliminated.  (SB 20-E, page 1319, lines 19-28)  *** The new
school code rewrite does not take effect until January,2003

Districts have creative ways of implementing this legislation.  You need to
call the district to find out exactly why, they are not planning to give
full credit.

If you need additional information, call 850/414-6694 - Florida House of
Representatives, Council for Lifelong learning or the Florida Department of
Education, Bureau of Educator Recruitment & Professional Development (850)
922-9750

Hope this helps!

Dear Governor Bush:

I hope this finds you and your family do well.

Not so long ago, I heard that you were going to allow teachers from one
county to transfer to other counties in Florida, without losing any
tenure.   Has this been put into effect?

As you know, my fiancé Donna, teaches fourth grade in Broward County and
she would like to relocate closer to our home but Donna does not want to
lose of any of years.  Can you let me know the status of this issue?
Right now, Palm Beach will allow you to transfer 10 but Donna has been

Palm Beach County has their job fair this Friday and I would like to

I will be happy to compile a list of projects for your consideration. In

General Government committee. Members were told that their projects

Thank you Paula. I agree with the intent of your letter. 
  
However, I have a dilemma. To veto the transfer will require vetoing a 
significant number a member projects. The working capital fund is very 
low and I have been told that the legislature's budget has been crafted 
to protect member projects from my scrutiny. Raiding trust funds, using 
proviso and working papers, etc. etc.... this is the way of the 
legislature. 
  
How can you help me? Maybe the 104 sponsors can suggest which projects I 
should veto from the projects that have been lined out to protect the 
unconscionable raiding of preservation funds. I am on board, ready to 
go. Can you help?

a building that would handle our foreseeable space needs for an expanded

needed. The clinic  and most of the research is needed much sooner than we
expected. The initial phase is 122M, full completion is another 66M, 40M
would be funded by the cigarette tax. and the rest by our fundraising. Dick

Governor,
 
I spoke to Commissioner Bronson today on the issue.  A lot of the money will be spent to develop biological controls for the plant.  Florida has been designated as the lead state in the southeast to come up with and implement a control procedure, and our risk is that if we don't other states won't accept our cattle.
 
After speaking with him I am not confident that the money available to DEP would work in this instance.  In short, I'd like to echo the Commissioners request that this item be approved.
 
Thanks for your interest and allowing our input.

May 29, 2002

 

The Honorable Jeb Bush

The Capitol

Tallahassee, FL 32399-0001

 

Dear Governor Bush:

 

I am sending this letter with the hope that you will take action to prevent the elimination of the children’s mental health treatment services now provided through Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health/DCF (PRTS) Purchased Residential Treatment Services dollars. 

 

Programs for severely emotionally disturbed children and their families that will be eliminated include residential treatment, therapeutic group homes, therapeutic foster care programs, in-home counseling, outpatient counseling, aftercare components and case management services.  The families that utilize these services will be unable to get these intensive mental health services in any other way.  Many of these families do not have Medicaid and their insurance does not cover these services. 

 

Most families are not able afford the $300.00 a day cost of a residential program for their child. If these services are not available to these severely emotionally disturbed children, they will continually be in and out of mental health crisis stabilization facilities, juvenile commitment programs, or possibly follow through with their homicidal and/ or suicidal threats. 

 

The parents of these children will be very frustrated with their inability to provide the level of care their child needs. Without the necessary support system these parents will most probably feel the need to relinquish custody of their child to the state to get their child the help they need. This type of desperate measure has been used in the past and was found to be ineffective and much more expensive both in human and financial terms. The goal of the Purchased Residential Treatment Services program is to keep families intact and to teach the necessary skills to help their children to become productive adults.  

 

Throughout the state thousands of severely emotionally disturbed children have been treated in cost-efficient therapeutically effective programs funded through the State of Florida. The funding shift awaiting the Governors signature will eliminate many   programs that currently assist families when mental health crises occur and support the child being maintained in the community. These are the very services that prevent children from requiring deep end and very expensive institutional placements. 

 

Please Governor Bush, take the necessary action to restore this funding and stop the transfer of PRTS funds to Medicaid.  The children and families of this state who do not qualify for Medicaid assistance are counting on you.

 

Sincerely,

Collier County FWCC officers are all but starving.  Their salary is WELL
below FHP's (by $7000.00 per year) and the local law enforcement department
salaries.  I expect to see more migration unless the State accepts a
modified Step pay plan and FUNDS it. The FWCC officers in the Collier County
area NEED Comparative Area Differential pay! That's all there is to it!
SOMEONE MUST SHOW THEIR SUPPORT FOR THESE OFFICERS!
IUPA and the State have lost a loyal worker.  We MUST continue our fight for

Dear Jeb,
 
I regret that I have to write you this e-mail at a time when you are
already faced with mounting problems with the Department of Families and
Children but a problem arrived on my doorstep unexpectedly and I can't
just turn away.  
 
Over the weekend, Debbie brought a co-worker, Stefani home to join our
family for a Sunday BBQ. Debbie had expressed concern for this girl
because she had no parents and said her landlord wasn't very nice to
her, so we decided to have her join us for a family day.   During the
day, Stephani, who is 16,  told us about the exorbitant rent her
landlord was charging her.  She explained that she pays over $600 per
month rent for a room in the home of an employee (case worker) of the
Department of Families & Children.  In addition,  the woman charges her
extra for food, telephone and other incidentals, and gets angry when she
has to pick Stefani up from work.   
 
If that wasn't bad enough, last night, the woman told the girl to "Pick
up your sh#$ and get out!!"   Being 16, the girl the only person she
knew she could call, a 19-year-old former foster sister to come get her.
She was picked up and spent the night with her foster sister.  To make
matters even worse, the landlord/caseworker, reported the girl as a
runaway today, and then had the girl's only means of communication, her
cell phone (that Stephani pays for) shut off.
 
Before her phone was shut off, Stefani called Debbie  asking her what
she should do.  Debbie handed the phone to me, and I have spent an
entire day trying to find this girl some help.  To me, this is an
inexcusable situation . . . certainly not as heinous as that of the
missing 5-year-old, but certainly of major concern when those in charge
of  protecting these kids are the ones taking advantage of them.
 
I have contacted a family court judge, the public defender's office, the
state attorney and Gus Bilirakis's office and am awaiting replies.
When I spoke with the State Attorney's office I was told I needed to
contact the girl's caseworker.   When I explained that the problem was
with one of the case workers in the same office, they still insisted
that I would have to talk with the case worker if there is a problem.
It seem to me, that calling the case worker who placed the girl with a
co-worker who is charging this girl rent plus is liking asking the "wolf
to watch the hen house!"  I was so baffled by the response, that I asked
the person at the State Attorney's office if there was anyone who looked
out for children in these situations and the answer I received was "I
don't know.  You have to call the case worker."    
 
I'm sure there are all kinds of rules and regulations that I don't know
and probably wouldn't understand.   But what I do know is that this
"case" is not a number but a child, without any parents, who is working
hard to maintain an 3.5 GPA in High School, works 30-40 hrs a week, and
is being grossly taking advantage of by the very people who should be
looking out for her.   I can't even explain how disgusted and frustrated
I am.
 
I realize you can't get involved in all the individual cases all around
the state, but considering the current scrutiny of this department, I
wanted to share this situation since it seems to involve employees of
the department using their positions in an improper way.
 
I will continue to work with the professionals locally until we can find
a suitable solution for Stefani.  My only concern is that I am leaving
on Monday for a trip to Washington D.C. with Debbie & Lisa. Although our
main purpose of the trip is for Debbie to visit Georgetown University
where she is seriously considering applying to the  School of Foreign
Service, we plan to send a couple of extra days touring the city, since
neither of the girls have ever visited before.  We planned the trip
early so when Debbie returns she can begin her search for a summer
job/internship or volunteer position with an agency or organization
associated with International or Latin American Relations to further
explore her possible career choice.   
 
Although I'm really excited and looking forward to taking Debbie & Lisa
to Washington, I am very concerned with leaving Stefani.  I hope we can
get her situation resolved before I leave on Monday, but I'm not very
optimistic at this point.  
 
Regardless of what happens with the Department and Stefani's immediate
situation, I have decided that I will continue to meet and work with
Stefani and be an adult she can trust and count on.  She seems to be a
remarkable young lady who has dreams and goals and appears to have the
strength of character to overcome her difficult childhood to achieve
them.  I only I hope I can help her see them come true.  
 
Thank you for listening.   
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Sandy Faulkner

Dear Mr. Kirkbride,

 I received your letter that made references to your department not making any comments at this time on any progress of the DPR bringing criminal actions against Model 2000 Inc. 
I must inform you that the DPR has had this case for just about two years and the people of Florida who were victims of this Talent agency scam are demanding some answers from the state of Florida. 

You know that this state licensed talent agency continues to rip consumers off each and every day. 
We have supplied evidence that this agency has violated well over 70% of Chapter 468 and of 5.01 yet the DPR hasn’t done a thing to stop them. 

Furthermore, 
The DPR has failed the people.
Our civil action was taken, as a direct result of the DPR’s inaction to enforce the laws of this state and believe me this fact hasn’t gone unnoticed by the national media. 

Additionally,
 I have just furnished evidence/and witnesses to Peter Hernandez that proves that a felony of application fraud has taken place here. 
And, the civil trial court transcripts from the first day (about 200 pages) are ready to be used as an investigative tool by the state.
You can Contact Barry hill & Assoc. for a copy at 813-229-8225
without further comment you will find that these are very interesting transcripts. 

I sincerely hope that the DPR gets its act together soon to help the documented 42 plus victims of this talent and modeling agency scam. 
If not then you can rest assured that heads will roll (and they should) after the national televised broadcast of this whole affair. 

You can contact my attorney for any additional information. 
Mr. Aaron French at 813-870-6021 

Sincerely, 
Rick West acting for his minor daughter Christy West

The Honorable Jeb Bush
Governor of the State of Florida
The Florida Capitol

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I am writing to request your consideration to maintain
a special project in the State's budget for this
coming year.  The project in question is in the
Education budget, line item 5B, SER/SABER for
$300,000.
 
Your commitment to the education of every young person
in Florida is more than well documented.  However, in
recent weeks, we have seen what can happen when our
State's youngest fall through the cracks of our
society's systems.  This project helps keep and
recover young people at-risk, or who have already
fallen through the cracks of our education system.
 
Setting these young Floridians back on their
educational track is critical to their lives and the
economy of their families, communities and our State.
 
 Governor, I respectfully request that you maintain
this small item in the Education budget for the State
of Florida.  I have seen what this organization can do 
and it is worthwhile to fund.
 
 Thank you.

Subject:	Veto budget - save my son!

Importance:	High

Dear Jeb,
I was saddened and outraged to hear about the last minute political
maneuver with the state budget regarding the cut of $2.5 million dollars
from the Department of Children and Families' children's purchased
residential treatment services (PRTS) and the additional transfer of $16
million dollars to the Statewide Inpatient Program (SIPPS), a newly
developed program designed to server only Medicaid eligible children!

My son, Wesley, is 11 years old and will graduate from the 5th grade next
Wednesday.  He was diagnosed when he was 6 with severe ADHD, ODD, and
recently was found to be bipolar.  We have been in individual and family
counseling and seeing a psychiatrist for his medications, ever since he was
first diagnosed.  We have worked with the public school system to provide
the appropriate learning environment for him without preventing the other
students learning needs.  Each year his behavior got worse.  By the time he
was in 4th grade, in October 2000, we had to home school him because he was
not able to control himself at school.

I don't know if you can understand the frustration and hopelessness a
parent feels when they see their child, full of potential, unable to
realize that potential, while they are doing everything they know to do.
We are a middle-class family so we are fortunate to have good benefits and
be able to see the multitude of specialists Wesley's situation requires.
But we were really blessed when Wesley became eligible to reside at Carlton
Manor.  Carlton Manor is a residential home for at-risk boys that provides
a highly-structured environment, and individual, group, and family therapy.
Carlton Manor is funded through the Suncoast Region ADM funds with some
matching funds from the Juvenile Welfare Board and other resources.

Wesley lives with us, his family, on the weekends.  He has been living at
Carlton Manor since July 31, 2001, and last grading period received
straight A's!  Quite an improvement from home schooling the year before!!
But Carlton Manor has also helped the family through family counseling and
observing what works in the group home.  Wesley is expected to "graduate"
(come back home) in the next few months.  I don't know what we would have
done or what Wesley would have become without this program.

I urge you not to approve the budget and lose this program.  For boys like
my son and their families, it is the only hope they have to learn to cope
in the world with their challenges.  If you would like any more information
about this facility, please do not hesitate to contact me.  My home phone
is (727) 375-9464, and the address is:

A draft letter to the Secretary is in your office, and seems to have

believe it could make a major difference to South Florida and the nation
and facilitate alternatives to our traditional sources of energy, both

Furthermore, we are viewing this $5M-per-year center as the kernel of a

Dear Governor Bush,

      I am obviously having problems with my computer, so will rely on cut and paste.

    Your apology regarding the lateness of your office’s contact appears genuine, and I appreciate that.  

    However, if you believe that the water management district governing board and basin board members are sufficient alone to reflect the concerns of the citizens, then I fear you may be too remote from the grass roots universe which I hear from every day.  Perhaps you are being misled or are otherwise unaware of the actual relationships between the real people and the bureaucracies.

     There have been several bills in the past few years – Panasoffkee, Lake Harris (no matter that they are without a basin board), Okeechobee – reflecting that the bureaucracies tend to placate, task force and study to death, but not get anything done.  Citizens are demanding more empowerment and participation in common bureaucratic practices, in particular those of the WMDs, which are perceived as autocratic, and this bill would have allowed participation with those boards and agencies in reporting back recommendations to the legislature, thus making them feel members of a democracy.  And, of course, in paying for those bureaucracies, legitimately they are entitled to participation.  The present system is not working Governor, which may be why these types of bills have been passed (in HB 374’s case, unanimously).  In the committees this year in particular, legislators voiced a sentiment that they want a legislative fix regarding the structure of the water management districts, and particularly the non-elected governing boards.  The discussions were substantial and in depth, primarily because legislators are hearing from their constituents.  

   If you think that the governing boards have been solving problems, look into the St. Johns WMD waste of $25,000,000 of P-2000, SOR and CARL funds, and missing equipment, and SWFWMD’s recent fiasco in spending $1,200,000 for a $600,000 job, in which they by-passed the competitive bidding process.

   I have been fighting inflated bureaucracies for years, doing so regularly as a member of the general government appropriations committee.  This bill is not to inflate bureaucracy or to grow bureaucracy.  It was to empower citizens to hold bureaucracies accountable.

   I wish I had the chance to talk with you before the veto, and share with you several years of  citizen input, which was the impetus for the bill.  Without having that information, and perhaps only having the territory-protecting view of the bureaucrats, the veto was a mistake.

      Sincerely, 

      Nancy Argenziano

The reasons for the veto were stated in the letter. I believe in our very own universe that this was the right thing to do. We have basin boards and a water management district board and that should be enough to get citizen input which I know is important. 
 
Again, I apologize for you hearing about this after the fact.

Dear Governor Bush: 

     I just received word from my office - word left on my answering machine at 4:58 Friday afternoon, by Hayden Dempsey - that you had vetoed HB 374, the Citrus Hernando Waterways bill.

     While I am disturbed by the actual veto - after all, in some universe there may have been a rational basis - I am still more disturbed by the specious after the fact notification and lack of courtesy in discussing the matter with me.  After all, I only worked on this matter with the citizens for two years, perhaps knew a thing or two, and could easily have contravened the veto message rationale.

      Oh yes, I am confused why you permitted passage of Senator Cowin's bill, with language and purpose identical to HB 374, and based thereon.  Apparently Lake County residents can input, but not those in Citrus and Hernando.

Dear Governor Bush:

I am sending this letter with the hope that you will take action to prevent the elimination of the children’s mental health treatment services now provided through Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health/DCF (PRTS) Purchased Residential Treatment Services dollars. 

Programs for severely emotionally disturbed children and their families that will be eliminated include residential treatment, therapeutic group homes, therapeutic foster care programs, in-home counseling, outpatient counseling, aftercare components and case management services. The families that utilize these services will be unable to get these intensive mental health services in any other way. Many of these families do not have Medicaid and their insurance does not cover these services. 

Most families are not able afford the $300.00 a day cost of a residential program for their child. If these services are not available to these severely emotionally disturbed children, they will continually be in and out of mental health crisis stabilization facilities, juvenile commitment programs, or possibly follow through with their homicidal and/ or suicidal threats. 

The parents of these children will be very frustrated with their inability to provide the level of care their child needs. Without the necessary support system these parents will most probably feel the need to relinquish custody of their child to the state to get their child the help they need. This type of desperate measure has been used in the past and was found to be ineffective and much more expensive both in human and financial terms. The goal of the Purchased Residential Treatment Services program is to keep families intact and to teach the necessary skills to help their children to become productive adults. 

Throughout the state thousands of severely emotionally disturbed children have been treated in cost-efficient therapeutically effective programs funded through the State of Florida. The funding shift awaiting the Governors signature will eliminate many programs that currently assist families when mental health crises occur and support the child being maintained in the community. These are the very services that prevent children from requiring deep end and very expensive institutional placements. 

Please Governor Bush, take the necessary action to restore this funding and stop the transfer of PRTS funds to Medicaid. The children and families of this state who do not qualify for Medicaid assistance are counting on you.

Sincerely,

Jean B. DuPuy

Throughout the state thousands of severely emotionally disturbed children have been treated in cost-efficient therapeutically effective programs funded through the State of Florida. The funding shift awaiting the Governors signature will eliminate many programs that currently assist families when mental health crises occur and support the child being maintained in the community. These are the very services that prevent children from requiring deep end and very expensive institutional placements. 

Please Governor Bush, take the necessary action to restore this funding and stop the transfer of PRTS funds to Medicaid. The children and families of this state who do not qualify for Medicaid assistance are counting on you.

Sincerely,

Ted E. Williams

Subject:	FW: An opportunity to help Alexander Siebert

Dear Ms. Siebert: 
Thank you for your email of May 22, 2002 telling me about your son Alexander.  I was concerned when I read in your email that you have been experiencing difficulties in working with the Infants and Toddlers Early Intervention Program.  At the same time, I was pleased to learn that you have been able to establish a positive and supportive relationship with the local Children's Medical Services (CMS) Network.  I encourage you to continue working with Heather Pepper, your CMS case management nurse to ensure that Alexander receives the medical supports and services that he requires. 

I hope that you will continue to work with the local Early Intervention (EI) Program to develop a Family Support Plan that appropriately addresses Alexander and your needs.  Dr. Michael Haney, Division Director for Prevention and Interventions, has assured me that staff from the Early Intervention Unit are working with you and local EI Program staff to address your concerns.  I understand that a Family Support Plan meeting for Alexander has been scheduled for early in June and that representatives from the CMS Program Office, the local EI Program and the local CMS Network will participate.  I am certain that with your advocacy and the expertise of this team we should be able to identify and respond to Alexander's needs.

I am always interested to hear from the families that we serve and again thank you for writing to me.  I am encouraged that the CMS Network and local CMS Early Intervention Program will be able to work together with you to address Alexander's medical and developmental needs. Let me know if I can be of any further help. 

Sincerely, 
John O. Agwunobi, M.D., M.B.A. 
Secretary

Subject:        An opportunity to help Alexander Siebert 

Dear Dr. Agwunbi,                                                     5/22/02 
I am writing today with regard to my little boy, Alexander.  He has been in the service of your department for almost two years now.  Originally he was diagnosed with developmental delay and he received physical therapy.  Alexander did not thrive and actually became more delayed in physical therapy and he required speech therapy and occupational therapy.

Since our initial intake into early intervention my son's care has been neglected.  I have made many requests, I have pleaded for assistance, I have even offered to take early intervention staff out to lunch but alas I was left with no recourse but to file formal complaints.  To date my complaints go unresolved.  Dr. Haney has a copy of everything I have sent and I will avail myself to you to answer any question you may have regarding Alexander, his condition, and my complaints.

Tragically, my son has been diagnosed with Leigh's disease; a mitochondrial disorder that's hallmarked by necrotizing brain tissue.  He literally has a degenerative brain disease in which he will only become worse.  He is terminally ill.  Phyllis Sloyer can also verify this information.  More tragically is the apathetical treatment he received in early intervention and the failure to address my formal complaints in order to help Alexander.

Today provides you with the opportunity to help Alexander, help early intervention services be a prevention and early in intervention model, and minimize future problems.  Alexander's FSP has been in noncompliance now for almost two years but more importantly Alexander has not received the services he needed to be identified early.  Please seize this opportunity to help my son, Alexander.

Thank you for your time and consideration, 
Elizabeth Siebert

Subject:	Blue Ribbon Panel Report

Dear Florida Leaders,

I want you to know how strongly I personally feel that the funding for the Dept of Children and Family needs to be re-vamped. Although there has been improvement in this area, the system is still over burdened.   I have been following the news closely and I am deeply concerned about the Children who depend on us to protect them only to have us as a society fail them in the very basic needs of health and safety.

Please take the necessary action and call a special session to address this issue brought forth and outlined in the Blue Ribbon Panel Report.  Please make this a priority and become informed on a personal level.  We rely on our leaders to represent us and to pass legislation and budget at appropriate levels of funding needed to protect our children.

We have got to protect and finance our most precious assets "our Children"  they are our future.  We need to take action and make this a priority.

Sincerely,

Joe Arriola has not yet had an opportunity to review the entire list and provide final input, and he may have questions or comments about those included or not included. 

	 We very much appreciate your offer of assistance in recruiting a board, and we welcome your comments and suggestions on the attached.  We will then finalize our list and begin the recruitment process.      In the interim, we believe it is important to keep this list of prospects confidential.

	Thank you for your interest and involvement.  We look forward to your questions and comments.

Phil ... thanks for the encouraging words ... they are greatly appreciated
for we with the Miccosukee Tribe don't experience many positive reactions to
our work ... for whatever reason, deference goes to others who often are
guided by whim and ulterior motives ... "trust responsibility" is ignored
... the experience and insights of the only group that lives in the
Everglades are dismissed without due consideration.  As our last resort,
we have learned that federal judges do listen best ... we actually wish
there was an easier way but there doesn't appear to be right at the moment.

Do want to clarify that the law suit is an 8.5 SMA citizens action not a
Tribal suit ... but the Miccosukee Tribe has stated over and over that the
clear words of the law say that the Secretary of the Army is directed to
construct a flood protection project and that any other plan would only
result in a "dead-end excursion" and further contribute to the destruction
of Tribal land and other natural areas, in addition to continuing the
flooding the people of Miami-Dade County ... 2 examples attached.

We hope that the ruling will enhance our credibility, as you suggest, and
encourage giving our voice a greater role in decision making ... we hope it
will inspire quick, decisive, rational action to get Mod Waters done by
building the congressionally approved 1992 Corps plan ... we hope that
Corps leadership rejects the false arguments that pushes them off track and
quickly chooses to "construct a flood protection project" for the people of
the 8.5 SMA as directed by Congress.  Hope springs eternal but history
does temper our expectations, as I'm sure you understand.

When this Magistrate's recommendation is adopted by
the judge, the Corps has a clear authority, justification, and means to get
the job done quickly ... hope they realize that the survival of the Tribe's
way of life depends on it and takes quick, decisive action.  But the Federal
government's initial response to the Magistrates recommendation is far from
heartening ... I have not read it personally but I've been told they argue
that "construct" doesn't mean "construct" (deja vu Clinton) ... that the
current administration would dig this deep to find a way to condemn property
that will move 102 families out of their homes, and this when they've been
given a way out of this quagmire, is hard for me to figure ... but I've quit
trying to figure a long time ago. I guess human nature rules and the first
response is vindication  ... there I go figuring again.

Sincerely, Terry

Subject:	Juvenile mental health bill

Mr. Bush, 
I cannot believe that you would sign a bill taking away the mental health programs and funding for juveniles. It is bad enough that help is limited but to take it away from the children is wrong. You and all the other people in government need to wake up and smell the coffee. You vote pay raises for congress and senate but don't give a damn about the children until they have overflowed the juvenile justice system or killed someone. And even then you don't care. The system is a joke and all your promises are for naught. I used to think you had good ideas but now I think you are like the rest of the wealthy in this country and care more about your own (the rich) than the people who actually work for a living, and struggle to survive on a daily basis. Go out there and take a 5.50 an hour job with no benefits and no food stamps and tell me how you could even begin to live. You have never done without anything in your life nor has anyone in the Bush family. If one of your family has a mental health issue you have the resources to send them to a PRIVATE FACILITY for treatment and hush it up; what about the rest of us humans? Look on the street- over half are people who need mental health services and Ronald Ragen turned them out of the palces they were getting help. If you sign this bill and stop funding or stop extended programs then expect more juvenile offenders and expect more violence because of  the lack of treatment needed to treat/teach these children to be a sucessful, productive part of society. Please do not deny the children anymore than is already denied them. It is bad enough that Florida is noted for its' lousy education system which is why I am leaving after graduation to teach out of state for less money.  The schools and other programs, for juveniles, should be TOP prority, not oil and gas in the gulf. We care so little for those who will choose to lead this nation in the future and we are definately not equal. I would not even be considered equal to you no matter if I have a degree or not. You need to go out there, away from the wealthy, upper class and see what REALITY is, $2.89 to 3.69 a gallon for milk, in case you don't know. After paying for it all,  mental health is the last thing you can afford for your child if you are a minimum wage worker or single parent. For the sake of the stateand the nation wake up! DO NOT SIGN THAT BILL! DO NOT VOTE ANOTHER PAY RAISE! GIVE THE CHILDREN A CHANCE TO LIVE A NORMAL LIFE OR GOD HELP WHO CHOOSES YOUR NUSING HOME- WHOOPS- FORGOT- YOU ARE WEALTHY ENOUGHT TO AFFORD PRIVATE CARE! 
 
 MENTAL HEALTH IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS PHYSICAL HEALTH. THANKS!
 
PS Please read these books  ODD GIRL OUT (recently written) and The Bell Jar (by Sylvia Plath); then you might have an idea of what it is like to cope, daily, with a mental illness that has no cure only treatment that may or may not be successful. We just try to survive.

The Honorable Jeb Bush

Dear Governor Bush:

I am writing to you on a matter that I feel is of great importance to young
Floridians in need of help.

A special project in the State's budget for this coming year,  SER/SABER, is
up for consideration.  This project helps keep and recover young
people-at-risk or who have fallen through the proverbial cracks of our
education system.  Having been involved with the SER organization over the
past 14 years, I can personally vouch for the importance and relevance of
this project and what it means to the young Floridians that avail themselves
of it's value.  We have seen what can happen when our young fall through the
cracks of our society's systems.  Setting these young people back on track
is critical to their lives, their families, our communities and our State.  

Your commitment to the education of our youth in Florida is well documented.
I respectfully request you consider this item positively and keep it in the
Education budget for the State of Florida.


Respectfully,

Subject:	US Airways

Dear Representative Mica:

I am concerned about delays of loans to airlines in danger of bankruptcy.  As a resident in the Orlando area, I hope you do not thwart efforts to secure loan approval for US Airways.  Loans were promised after 9/11.  Those loans are desperately needed and should be provided without delay.  Instead of helping airlines devastated by 9/11 events and subsequent security measures, elected leaders seem to be spending tax dollars on everyone in the world except the airlines.  This jeopardizes the jobs of thousands of workers.  The cost to taxpayers will be loss of taxes and the need for massive amounts of federal funds for unemployment, retraining programs, etc. The trickle down effect will be a weakened economy.  The emotional effect hurts families who lose income, medical benefits, retirement benefits, and perhaps lose their homes, as well.

US Airways is the #2 airline in Orlando.  Thousands of local citizens will be effected when US Airways goes bankrupt.  Airline employees, employees in airline support services, and members of the tourist industry will be negatively impacted if US Airways goes bankrupt.  Representative Mika, you are one of the most influential voices in deciding loan approvals for the airlines.  Please hear the voice of thousands of your constituents who want to keep their jobs.

There seems to be no legitimate reason to delay promised loans until October when those loans are needed now.  US Airways is not asking for a hand out such as ones provided to struggling countries worldwide or to special interests groups asking for subsidies.  It is a LOAN to an AMERICAN company hit hard by an act of war against our country...a company that employs thousands of ordinary citizens who pay taxes and mortgages, save for retirement, and hope to put their kids through college, etc. Please push for immediate approval of necessary loans and do not let politics influence any decision to delay.  

Florida voters expect elected officials to be honest in delivering the promises they made.  History shows that nothing angers voters more than a breach of trust. A delay of loan approval will cost thousands of jobs.  If loans are later approved to other airlines after a major airline goes bankrupt, it will appear politically motivated and demonstrate callous disregard for thousands of employees impacted by layoffs.  Such actions will be examined carefully by voters in future elections.  

Please reconsider your outspoken position on this matter and show that the promises made after 9/11 were not merely hollow promises.  After 9/11, there was a sense of unity, efforts to help our country heal, and lack of partisan bickering.  It showed how great this country can be when good leadership is provided.  Now more than ever, that leadership is needed to keep jobs and help local economies recover from the horrific events of 9/11.

Please do what is best for the thousands of people in Central Florida and across the nation who depend on airline related jobs.  Promote and vote for immediate airline loan approvals for US Airways.  Show the people who elected you that you care about them, their jobs, and the future of the # 2 airline in Orlando.  Thank you.

Most sincerely,
Paul Simon

Dear Gov. Bush;
 
                              Hello, my name is Rita
Moorefield. I am a single parent of 3 lovely children.
My oldest in currently enrolled in a state funded
program for mental health.Clayton is enrolled ay
Carlton Manor. My son Clayton,13, has been diagnoised
with A.D.H.D and BiPolar Disorder. He is normal child
otherwise. Clayton and I have been through alot since
the death of his father 9 years ago. I have gotten him
help froom other programs that were unsecessfully.
Clayton has been in the program for  5 weeks now. He
has made some improvments. It's going to be a long
road to recovery for him.
 
                              Please Mr. Bush, look
carefully at the Bill you are asked to sing for a 2.5
million dollar cut for The Department of Children and
Families.The Purchased Residentail Treatment Services
are the programs that will suffer.My son is in that
program.It was the hardest choice for me as a parent
to make.I feel it will cost the tax payers more in the
long run,as these kids grow up. They could crowd the
already crowded jails,make more unemployment, and more
adult mental health patients. If we give them help now
then these kids have a chance at a good life as
adults. Maybe one of these kids could be The President
of the United States one day.
 
                               Please Mr. Bush, I'm
begging you as a parent of one of these kids
,recosider this BILL. Think of what tis Bill would
mean to one child's future!!!! Think of someone taking
that kind of future from your children, neices or
nephews.
 
                               After the BAD publicity
this State has had lately with this Department, Could
we stand anymore? This Bill in my eyes is a form of
child abuse!!!!!!!!!!!!! These kids, especially my
son, deserve a promising future. I love my son very
much and my only wish for him is to have a good life,
I have finally found him the help he needs and you're
going to take it away.Please DON'T it would eventually
tear my family apart!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
                                There should be more
program awareness for these . In my case they have
been a God send. They deserve more than they
.Thank-you for letting me axpress my views to you.I
only hope and pray it will help you o reconsider this
BILL.
 
                                                 
Sincerly,
 Rita Moorefield

Betty Jordan will be moving back to ACHA next week after having served the PL in the EOG very well over the last year.  She has systemitized, organized and made our work place a gentlier place to spend 10-12 hours every day. We also understand her current need to have more time for her family and more control over her schedule. Gosh knows control over one's own schedule has not been the norm around PL for the last year with 5 legislative sessions, 9/11,   700 some bills and a few budgets.... Betty has made a real difference and she will be missed. Due to everyone's crazy schedules we will plan a nice PL team lunch on June 14th.
 
Jan Russo, from OTTED will be joining our PL team replacing Betty Jordan. Please welcome Jan.

Subject:	Purchased Residential Treatment Services 

May 30, 2002

Govenor Jeb Bush
The Capitol
Tallahassee, FL 32399-0001

Dear Governor Bush:

I am sending this letter with the hope that you will
take action to prevent the elimination of the
children’s mental health treatment services now
provided through Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental
Health/DCF (PRTS) Purchased Residential Treatment
Services dollars. 

Programs for severely emotionally disturbed children
and their families that will be eliminated include
residential treatment, therapeutic group homes,
therapeutic foster care programs, in-home counseling,
outpatient counseling, aftercare components and case
management services.  The families that utilize these
services will be unable to get these intensive mental
health services in any other way.  Many of these
families do not have Medicaid and their insurance does
not cover these services. 

Most families are not able afford the $300.00 a day
cost of a residential program for their child. If
these services are not available to these severely
emotionally disturbed children, they will continually
be in and out of mental health crisis stabilization
facilities, juvenile commitment programs, or possibly
follow through with their homicidal and/ or suicidal
threats. 

The parents of these children will be very frustrated
with their inability to provide the level of care
their child needs. Without the necessary support
system these parents will most probably feel the need
to relinquish custody of their child to the state to
get their child the help they need. This type of
desperate measure has been used in the past and was
found to be ineffective and much more expensive both
in human and financial terms. The goal of the
Purchased Residential Treatment Services program is to
keep families intact and to teach the necessary skills
to help their children to become productive adults.  

Throughout the state thousands of severely emotionally
disturbed children have been treated in cost-efficient
therapeutically effective programs funded through the
State of Florida. The funding shift awaiting the
Governors signature will eliminate many programs that
currently assist families when mental health crises
occur and support the child being maintained in the
community. These are the very services that prevent
children from requiring deep end and very expensive
institutional placements. 

Please Governor Bush, take the necessary action to
restore this funding and stop the transfer of PRTS
funds to Medicaid.  The children and families of this
state who do not qualify for Medicaid assistance are
counting on you.

Sincerely,

Catherine A. Urban
Resident of Florida

Osceola never gets its fair share of the education money. That needs to

EFI has been following up on this project and feels that there is a need here for a small QACF award.   Before send a formal recommendation they want to be sure you  (and the Governor if you need to discuss it with him) are comfortable with a recommendation.  Crystal is working up some notes on the issue, but Coke is going to need at least an indication that we will support QACF by next Wed., so I want to give you a heads up.  Attached is the content of an e-mail from Coke explaining the Florida disadvantages and a copy of the QTI recommendation memo outlining the project (QTI already approved).  We will have a draft of the QACF recommendations tomorrow or Friday, but basically we are talking about 300 jobs at $41,739 for a new beverage manufacturing facility ($120 million investment) in Auburndale/Polk County.  Georgia has some strong tax advantages (explained in the attachment) and Coke has strong ties to Georgia.  
 
We have an uncommitted balance in the QACF appropriation of $125,000 (assuming Citicorp goes through) ,  and they are requesting $100,000.
 
I think we discussed this briefly last week, but wanted to let you know it is moving a long.

Dear Gov. Bush:

Thank you for your rapid response to our request for assistance from the FDOT on the road grant for the proposed Minute Maid/Coca-Cola plant in Auburndale.  As you are aware, Coca-Cola proposes to construct a $120 million non-carbonated beverage plant in Florida or Georgia. Company officials tell us that Georgia is really putting the squeeze via incentives on Coke to build the large (400 high-paying jobs) facility in their home state.  As you know, the extra incentives that Georgia can offer are the exemptions on all purchases of manufacturing machinery and equipment, not just purchases at initial start-up. Coca-Cola has calculated that it will cost an extra $100,000 in sales tax in Florida if they locate here.

It has come to our attention that you have a discretionary fund -- the Quick Action Closing Fund -- to help put Florida on top in close deals like this one. We sincerely request that you allocate these funds to the Coca-Cola Company to win this project for our great state.  As always, we appreciate your continued support for the community and economic development of Polk County.

Your friend, Jack Myers, Chairman, Polk County Board of County Commissioners.

Subject:	veto 1307

Dear Governor Bush:
The following are excerpts taken from a letter emailed you on May 22, 2002:

*	I also have grave concerns about the process by which this amendment was slipped into this bill.  I contacted an ADAWG member, Mr. J. R. Harding, before the bill passed and requested the bill number.  On 3/21/02, I received an email response that states, "Unfortunately, I cannot fulfill that request." 

*	I also contacted Mr. Rick Dixon, Executive Director, Florida Building Commission, Department of Community Affairs (DCA), on 3/12/02 and inquired of DCA's involvement and requested the bill number.  He responded via email - "The Commission is not pursuing legislation this year so groups running their own initiatives are not compelled to ask whether their amendments to bills are acceptable to us."  Oddly enough, Ms. Julie Shaw just publicly announced that DCA was one of the five industry organizations she negotiated with regarding the amendment.

*	During her presentations, [at the Florida Building Commission meetings] Ms. Shaw stated that she had researched past waiver applications from the Florida specific requirement for vertical accessibility and found that the majority of the waivers granted were based on an average of 20% of the cost of the alteration/renovation. Counterpoint:  What Ms. Shaw did not say that was raised on public record is that her research of the 20% average was applicable to vertical accessibility only.  If signed, this bill/amendment provides that the estimates for the 20% rule will now extend to include parking, signs, curb cuts, ramps, doorways, thresholds, door hardware, floor surfaces, bathrooms (stalls, accessible toilets, countertops, grab bars, door hardware, faucet hardware, pipe insulation, turning radius, accessible dispensers, and sinks and countertops), display cases, counters, physical access to goods and services, audible and visual alarms, compliant payphones, TDD telephones where applicable, water fountains, and more - areas already covered under 28 C.F.R. 36.403 (f) (2) (I) (ii) (iii) (iv). Applicants will NOT have to provide vertical accessibility because they have applied the 20%, as just illustrated. Also look at 28 C.F.R. 36.403 (g) (1) &(2) - order of applying the 20%. 

*	Ms. Shaw has stated that she did not "want to open up the code" --- 553.509 Vertical Accessibility.  Counterpoint:  Reread paragraph seven [the paragraph before this one] - this amendment combines the Florida specific requirements for vertical accessibility with all other requirements of federal law; in essence, it is a covert way of nullifying F.S. 553.509.

Subject:	HB1307 Today

Dear Governor Bush,
    Well, there are zillions of rumors floating around, Homebuilders lobbyist 
is saying that you will sign HB1307 regarding an amendment that lets builders 
in existing buildings only pay 20% of the cost of construction. 
    I still don't believe you will. I don't believe you wouldn't lean toward 
the people in any situation. People will be limited if you do, and there is 
no good reason that I know of in the bill to sign it. The inspection 
depts/owners that are currently hiring private Architects and Engineers will 
continue to do so when you Veto, the elevator component is duplicated in 
SB990, non-problem there, and we will have a chance to talk to our voted 
representatives and senator to support our position for next session. If we 
loose then, it is at least fair. 
    Besides politics, is there any reason to sign HB1307 that outweighs the 
safety concern of the inspector process, or access to second floor shops and 
jobs for people? 
    I'm glad you're the Governor. To me, this is an easy decision, but I have 
had a tough time trying to explain the effects because most people don't 
understand code, I pray someone has explained it to you right, or you 
understand it from the emails. You must have dozens of bills on your desk-I 
read about the one with the Grayhounds, Bunny Armstrong and I thought the 
dogs and us had alot in common as far as the bills go, and took hope because 
you had a heart for the grayhounds, and figures we're at least above them in 
priorities. Thought I'd share that and you'd laugh too-it was a jest in fun, 
and gave us hope. Basically we're just praying.
Best of luck with your decisions,
Blessings,

Dear Governor Bush:

Coordinated Child Care of Pinellas, Inc. has been actively supporting local
quality child care initiatives for over 30 years.  We are soliciting your
help in the campaign for quality child care for all children by signing SB
1550/Silver/Ausley Child Care Training/Articulation Bill into law.

The provisions in SB 1550 not only raises the level of professionalism, but
ensures that the children in child care homes are offered a strong
school-readiness foundation by increasing to 45 clock hours the required
introductory training course, revising the minimum training requirements to
include training in brain research and computer technology, and requiring a
competency examination upon successful completion of the required trainings.

Your support of SB 1550 would be greatly appreciated.  If I can ever been of
any assistance to you regarding any early education or child care issue,
please do not hesitate to contact me.

Subject:	Re: PETER HENN / Request for weather Shelter for children of Bithlo, onEcon river.


Mr. Goodman,

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Steve Miller and I serve as
the Director of the Division of Land Management for the St. Johns River
Water Management District.  Your e-mail was forwarded to me for response.
I would like to answer some of your questions and correct some
misinformation you seem to have received.

As Mr. Henn explained to you in his e-mail, the buildings removed from the
Longbranch Park tract were both a hazard and an attractive nuisance.  Their
removal was necessary and justified.

Mr. Henn has not "refused to assist" the community of Bithlo but he
represents the District, and the District is working to provide
recreational access and facilities on nearly a half million acres in 19
counties.  The District has built a number of inclement weather shelters on
various conservation areas.  We continue to do so as we can.  Not every
acre, nor every tract, can be developed  for recreational access at the
same time since staff and funds are limited.  The challenge is not merely
building the facility, but also providing adequate oversight and security
so that the illegal activity experienced in the old camp does not recur.
In the case of Longbranch Park, Orange County is the lead manager and will
be developing the recreational access. The District is assisting the County
by providing limited oversight until the County's plans are implemented.

Adjacent to the Longbranch Park tract, the District has provided
recreational access and some limited facilities, including primitive camp
sites, at the Hal Scott regional Park and Preserve.  In fact, portions of
the Longbranch Park tract are accessible by foot, bicycle and horseback
from Hal Scott.

Your allegations against Mr. Henn concerning "an under the table deal"
alarm me and I would ask that you either provide proof or stop slandering
Mr. Henn.  If you continue without any evidence to support your claim, I
will be forced to refer the matter to the District's Office of General
Counsel.

Regarding the boat launch at SR 50, the District continues to work toward
its construction.  Because of the wet nature of the land, the engineering
and permitting has been more difficult and time consuming.  We are awaiting
the last permit and plan to finish the airboat launch this year.

If you have questions, you may contact me directly at (386) 329-4399.

Hi all,
    The governor just got snowed. I warned Kevin Tang the statistics Julie 
handed out at the Council meeting were laughed at. Anyone that is familiar 
with the process will recognize the numbers are stacked to appear to prove 
this is what the commission is using the 20% currently. Neil Melick, our 
Center for Independent Living rep for statewide organizations sent you this 
email last week:
   As for the determination that waiver cases being approved were
   primarily those with more than 20% disproportionate cost and
   waivers denied were less than 20%, that is probably a correct statement
   - if we are talking about  those cases approved by the Commission and
   not by recommendation of the Council and if the statistics were taken
   prior to January 2002.  Since then, the Council has done a better job in
   making recommendations and giving time to comply.  Since
   January, I know that the majority of the vertical accessibility
   cases have been granted with condition that vertical accessibility be
   provided within a specified time.  None of   these cases even dealt with
   disproportionate cost.  With the signing of HB 1307, this type of option
   would not be   available and vertical accessibility will not be
   obtained.
Is the Governor thinking we are all lying? All the people in Florida who have 
called, emailed and faxed are ignorant? I am beyond disappointed that none of 
his staff truely represented the position of people with disabilities in 
Florida. Now all of you are responsible for the grave injustice done to us, 
because we took the time to call you and email you and fax you to let you 
know of the problem, and nothing was done. Our vertical accessibility laws 
made our state better. The Veto just made it nothing to be proud of for us.

    It is important that you know that I am in total agreement with all the 
requests for veto of HB 1307.  So much has been done to advance or enhance 
the levels of productivity in the lives of the disabled, yet, so much has 
still been in the works to thwart the accomplishments and make the disabled 
prisoners in their homes and communities.  Please veto HB 1307 for the sake

Dear Governor Bush:

As a teacher in Osceola County, I see our desperate need for the funding
for fast-growing counties, and I would like to send you my personal
request to please support that funding as we are in dire need of it.  In
fact, our school is under construction as I write this e-mail, and we have
suffered many budget cuts due to the September 11 attack.

I was teaching the day of the attack, and your brother was at a Florida
school in Sarasota.  I said a prayer for him and for our great nation that
day, and I pray now that you will continue to support us in our
fast-growing needs in such a diverse community.  It is with pride that I
am able to say a story I wrote along with six of my students' stories will
be published in a book to be released this summer by WordWalker Publishing
and Obadiah Press titled 911:  THE DAY AMERICA CRIED.  My story is titled
911:  A Cry for Tolerance, and out of dozens of submissions, only six of
my students' work was chosen, but six I am very proud of because they
young Americans take pride in their way, the only way they could help,
through the 'power of the pen' and the 'power of the written word' with
the September 11 attack.  The proceeds from the book will all be donated
to the Todd Beamer Foundation and neither the students nor myself are
making any money from this project, but money is not why we wrote those
stories.

I can also proudly say that my students used their creative minds and
thinking skills and produced a four-color professional paperback book
titled VOICES OF THE DENN JOHN WRITING DRAGONS ON THE ROLLER COASTER OF
LIFE with a special section dedicated as a memoiral tribute to the
September 11 victims and their families.  We are proud of our great
nation, and as Americans, we did what we could in our own way to show it!

I hope you will seriously consider my request, and I know in my heart God
hears my prayers!  If you ever happen to read the story I wrote, you will
understand why I can say that.  By the way, I read Barbara Bush's story in
CHICKEN SOUP FOR THE MOTHER'S SOUL and loved it.  I read it to my students
in class as I am a strong advocate of using the books as oral-reading
models and writing prompts.

Charla:

I hope this e-mail finds you doing well.  I just returned from London all
seems to be coming together nicely as it relates to Governor Bush's agenda
for the upcoming Team Florida mission in July.  See attached day-to-day
working itinerary for Governor.

I need to point out that this mission is a bit different then the others as
Governor will be addressing a variety of audiences and his speeches will
vary from group to group - a bit more complex then past Team Florida
missions.  With this in mind, I feel we need to do a top to bottom briefing
prior to mission with Governor and his staff.  Would this be possible?  If
so, could this happen before month of July?  Please let me know.

Thanks!

May 30, 2002

The Honorable Katherine Harris
Secretary of State
PL02, The Capitol
Tallahassee, Florida 32399-0250 


Dear Secretary Harris: 

I hereby transmit to you, with my signature, Council Substitute for House Bill 1307, entitled:

	An act relating to Building Code Development. 

There are many sound reasons to sign this bill.  Council Substitute for House Bill 1307 contains numerous provisions to streamline application of building code issues.  Florida should be proud of its achievement to develop and implement a uniform building code.  The code went into effect on March 1st of this year.  The bill provides a process for nonbinding decisions, expedites hearings, and provides higher standards for local amendments to the code.  Further, it authorizes the option for a building owner to use private providers to conduct plan reviews and building inspections.  The bill also contains provisions passed in Senate Bill 990 regarding the privatization of elevator inspections.  On the whole, the provisions in this bill are aimed at facilitating the application of the new code.

However, a provision was added, which has raised great concern among persons with disabilities.  Under current law, when renovations occur to an existing building, the building must meet Florida accessibility requirements.  This requirement, at times, creates a disincentive to renovation and reuse due to disproportionate costs of the accessibility requirements.  This bill would modify current law to provide a brightline test to determine economic hardship in the granting of waivers regarding vertical accessibility in existing buildings.  As Florida's cities age, it is important to promote the continued use and rehabilitation of buildings to maintain an active community and vibrant economy.  However, the people who live in our communities are key to making this happen.  Florida has made great strides to address the needs of our residents and visitors with disabilities.  While we must address the issues of renovating buildings and providing access to all, we should strike an appropriate balance.

The Honorable Katherine Harris 

May 30, 2002

Page Two


A review of waivers granted indicates that this bill does not significantly alter current practice.  In some cases applicants were required to comply with conditions over time.  However, there is no provision for the enforcement of these conditions.  Further, other waivers were granted with conditions not related to cost.  The standards under the new law have not changed for these types of cases.

I have heard from many individuals who have expressed concerns with the application of this new provision.  Florida's specific accessibility requirements still require access to all levels above and below ground, exceeding the federal vertical accessibility requirements, which are limited to primary function areas.  I wish to state my position that the Accessibility Advisory Council and the Florida Building Commission should apply these provisions with great scrutiny and with an aim toward ensuring accessibility for all our residents and visitors.

A good example of how this provision can be applied, while still ensuring access is provided, occurred at the May 2002 meetings of the Accessibility Advisory Council and the Florida Building Commission.  An applicant submitted a request for a waiver regarding vertical access.  The building was being converted from apartments to a non-profit charter school.  The project costs were estimated at $305,000, with the elevator costs estimated at between $133,000 and $148,000.  The Council identified an alternative and less costly means to provide this access.  The applicant agreed to provide vertical accessibility to the second floor through the Limited Use Limited Application Elevator.

I believe this balance is achievable, and my administration will see it accomplished.  The bill calls for the Florida Building Commission to develop recommendations with input from the disabled and development communities concerning the rehabilitation and use of existing structures.  I encourage them to look at this issue and recommend any changes that they feel are appropriate to achieve the sensible middle ground between the industry's input and the need for accessibility in the renovation of our buildings.

In the final analysis, however, Council Substitute for House Bill 1307 is sound legislation deserving of my signature.  For this reason, and the other reasons set forth herein, I hereby sign it.

Sincerely,




Jeb Bush

We can work with Pam and do a lot of the background questions, but they would like to talk to you personally, they are requesting 30 minutes prior to June 15 and they will come to you.
 
I have talked with Pam we recommend that we accept the interview.  Can we proceed and work with Tara/Charla to find time on your schedule?

Pam
 
 What this refers to is a cover feature in South Florida CEO Magazine that will recognize the Governor for receiving the International Person of the Year of the world trade Center and will  highlight his international economic development accomplishments. . I would be happy to work with you on updating the Governor's  international accomplishments, since a lot of it you already have from the Governor's annual report last year. 
 
I also suggested to them that it would be best to submit the questions electronically and   let the Governor answer them but they feel for a feature cover story they need at least 1/2 hour face to face.
 
South Florida CEO is published by  Americas Publishing Group  who also publish Latin CEO.. South Florida CEO has a circulation around  50,000 in Dade, Broward and Palm Beach County JP Faber is their editor. I have worked with him in the past and find him to be fair and very pro -business. He assures me this meant as a favorable article recognizing the governor's achievements. . the President of Americas Publishing is the outgoing chairman of the World trade Center - Miami which is the organization recognizing the Governor.
 
The sticky point is they want this article in the June issue in order to be able to distribute it  at the Governor's dinner. So they need to go to press by June 17th, so according to them they need to do this in the next 2 weeks. JP says he is willing to  travel to meet the governor any time any where. In extremis I sense he may settle for phone time although he insists he needs to meet the governor to get a real sense of the person.
 
JP's phone if anyone in Communications wants to call him is 305-379-1118.
 
Manny

Dear Governor Bush,

I was extremely disappointed with yoyr veto of the Senate bill that 
would have encouraged greyhound adoption at Florida racetracks. 
Your obvious lack of knowledge about the amount of gambling that 
takes place at greyhound tracks showed in your comments following 
the veto.
It is very discouraging to know that the person charged with leading 
the state has so little knowledge about important issues and is led 
blindly by the few who oppose greyhound racing.
I believe your short-sightedness on this issue is going to lead to more 
incidents like the one that occurred in Alabama.
Of course, you have lost any chance of receiving my vote in the 
upcoming election and have lost the votes of the many thousands who 
champion the cause of greyhound adoption.
When you return to the real world after you are defeated in the next 
election, I hope you will find it in your heart to open your home to a 
retired racer.

Thanks Rosa for your efforts.

The Empowerment funds will be utilized in the following manner:
$1.4M to acquire, renovate and expand parking linked to a community based
shopping center in Overtown. This project is linked to an EZ joint venture
with Bank Of America to support the first new construction of single family
housing activity in Overtown over thirty years.

$1.3M will be utilized to support a commercial development initiative
linked to the Freedom Tower facility on Biscayne Blvd. We are seeking to
stimulate the development of a hotel and/or a commercial building attached
to the existing structure. This investment will supplement an existing
allocation of $100,000 in pre development funding form the empowerment
zone. Our focus here is on Miami's central business district.

$1.5M will be utilized to support infill housing development in East Little
Havana. Our activities in the area may be linked to the East little Havana
CDC as well as our neighborhood assembly.

The balance of the funds (Appx. $800,000) will be utilized for
contingencies and administration.

Thank You !

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I was appalled and surprised at your veto of the Waterways bill.  I thought you were in touch with the needs of Citrus county to restore our chain of lakes and protect our water resources by the excellent changes you made to the Southwest Florida Water Management District with the appointments of Al Coogler and Sam Lyons.  I thought the positive moves that have come from improved relations with the District indicated a new  future for our lake system and gave you the final credit.
 
The Tsala Apopka chain of lakes are vital to the economic health of Citrus County.  Although this bill would not have initially done anything to restore these lakes to health at least it was an attempt to begin.  We need action desperately and we needed it yesterday!
 
I have always supported the Republican Party and you had my vote, but how can I support you for Governor again when you vote against the very issues closest to my own heart -- restoration of the Tsala Apopka chain of lakes.
 
The only person who seems to have the true concerns of the people of our area in her heart is Nancy Argenziano and you don't seem to understand that and give her the support she deserves.  The money we have to give to the Party will go to her. 
 
I hope you will do something to help our lakes soon and restore my confidence in your ability to lead our state.
 
Sincerely,
 
Patricia S. Brady

Governor Bush:
    I am a concerned parent of 2 healthly, smart, happy boys. I am concerned about the FCAT test that the children take in the schools. I DISAGREE with the test.  I do not think that a child should be under the pressure of taking 1 test that determines if he graduates are not.  I realize that they have the chance of taking the test more than once after the 10 grade if they do not pass it the 1st time.  However that makes no differnece to me.  Both of my boys are A B students. One of them does very well on test.  However the other one does not test well at all.  He has never nor probably will ever score high on the FCAT test.  Please do not ask me if he has a learning disability. I am saying that because I have called the Department of Education-- I have talked with teachers and just about everyone I know to talk to concerning these test and when I state that he is a poor tester that is the 1st thing that I am ask. I have prayed long and hard concerning these test and I beleive that even if both of my boys tested well and scored high, I would still disagree with them.

Governor Jeb Bush
PL 05 The Capitol
400 South Monroe Street
Tallahassee, FL 32399-0001

Dear Governor Bush,

I was introduced to you back on August 13, 2001 by Seth Gordon at the
Wyndham Hotel in Miami at a Special Breakfast meeting held by the
Technology
Group of the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce. As a member of the
Chamber's
Trustee Board, I spoke on "If you build it, they will come" as I
represented
my former employer Dynegy, Inc. in the capacity of VP Sales for the
Americas. As I mentioned then, you have been built as our Technology
Governor and I applaud you for your efforts. Since then our focus has
changed from just serving Florida's technology needs but also to include
our
country's need for security and the accessibility of information.

As an example, Dynegy, Inc. recently eliminated 60% of its
telecommunications sales force and is restructuring its corporate
operations
to sell off its network assets. These are business decisions that are
predicated on the events of September 11th. But with change comes
opportunity.  After that breakfast meeting you sent me a very touching
email
that offered your support whenever I needed it. With the effect of
September
11th, it has made me realize that I am ready to pursue another
challenging
situation and ask for your assistance at this time.

I would like to request your help in bringing to the table an additional
group of investors or financial institutions to participate in a project
that my team has been working on. Our product is much like DOS and
Windows
from Microsoft.   At least 85% of all computers have the windows
operating
system.  Global Diversity, using its new patented technology, can reach
a
licensing agreement with Microsoft, AT&T, Dell and others, to use its
technology in conjunction with all the new computers sold and reach all
legacy or present hardware systems. Our technology can reach what was
once
thought to be an impossible sector of the public, "the Last Mile" for
those
in the public sector who still has copper wiring.  We have the
capability to
send audio and video data over this copper wire at broadband band speed
and
then store it in a real time retrieval format.

 As Governor, you have access to a wide range of knowledge concerning
investors, capital and financing.  We would like to leverage your
contacts,
and as such, we are requesting a referral and or introduction with
possible
investors, financial institutions or other institutions in the next week
or
so. I would also inquire as to any funding sources from the State of
Florida
that might be used towards this type of project.  We fully understand
you
cannot make commitments for or to any parties.  But as our Governor,
your
introduction carries with it great respect.    We are only seeking an
audience.  Our project must and will stand on its own merit.  The
Structure
is sound or it is not.  The technology is sound and works or it does
not.

The complete funding requirement for this project is $200M.   We are
seeking
to allocate this project into 4 phases of $50M over the next 18 months.
This project is seeking to comply with the Patriot Act and SEC Economic
Recovery Task Force, with CEO Link.  We can provide a real time
computerized
storage and retrieval infrastructure system that facilitates automatic
and
failsafe disaster recovery. This will make our nation's Financial
Systems
and other critical data driven industries effectively resilient to
heinous
terrorist's attacks such as 9/11. This kind of technology infrastructure
is
much needed for our economy to combat and flourish in the current
climate.
We have received a verbal commitment from another financial group that
will
match any investment over $5 Million, dollar for dollar.  We have
secured
insurance coverage from a top five insurance company to guarantee the
full
return of all principle invested in our project, through an Investment
Advisor.  This advisor also has access to the New Market Tax Credit
through
the use of CDE's to offer a 39% tax credit for investment in our project
as
it qualifies under the criteria.  (As the CDE is a federal tax credit is
does not decrease the tax generation of Florida tax revenue) Our
business
plan is very sound and structured to work with the masses of already
installed computer hardware.  We presently have government contracts and
private contracts, but at this time do not have the cash flow to
complete
these ventures to expand our business.  The opportunity is within our
reach,
but yet just a fingertip away.  This opportunity will increase the
States
tax base as it brings commerce from industry to our State, and jobs.

With this matching investment and federal tax credit, we can execute a
well-thought, well-organized company that would bring about tremendous
economic development opportunities for a region for which you serve.
Placing Florida on the map for an economic boom in jobs and revenue.  As
the
philosophy of private sector is what generates economic growth, and this
concept has been promoted by the republican party, it is our intention
to
also develop a sound contribution process, by using a percentage of
profits
from this venture to develop contributions to an IRC 527 who will
facilitate
contributions towards election and re-election processes for Republican
political candidates.

This will also facilitate a substantial consistent fund-raising vehicle
from
an Orlando based minority company with the ability to grow to the size
of a
Microsoft in a very short period of time.  We have the business plan,
the
mixing of financial investors, the ability to secure these investors
with a
guarantor and the federal legislation to make this project work.  At
this
time, no other company can provide the service that our technology can
accomplish.  As you know, the DOS system ran out of money and Bill Gates
bought that technology and became the US richest man.  Here we have
African
Americans who have this same type of technological new wave of
technology,........we just cannot let this get away from our hands.  As
the
present Governor and your brother the present President, seeking ways to
reach out to African Americans, what better way to reach out and touch
this
sizable constituency.  All we are asking is that with your knowledge
base of
financial persons and institutions, that as requested by a citizen of
the
State of Florida that we be introduced or referred by you or your office
to
people who have the power to make decisions for development of a State
industry.

I understand this might be a stretch for me asking you for help, but
please,
if there is any thing that you can do, or any person or groups that you
can
refer us to, I would, my family would and African Americans all across
this
country would be forever in your debt.

Attached to this letter, you will find a summary of the Global Diversity
project along with a White Paper that highlights the core storage
technology
our company provides.  Time is of the essence; I have a 30-day window
from
our initial investor to fund this project.  Your support and any
assistance
that you could provide would be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,
Anterro Graham

Governor -- Please, no need to respond.  Regarding the proposed Regents constitutional amendment, I just wanted to offer to you to feel free to pass on to whoever is organizing the opposition to this that I will gladly tell the story of Boca Raton-FAU relations and how they have improved tremendously under the current system.  What was a total breakdown between the city and the university is now a smooth working relationship due in no small measure to the board of trustees you appointed (and also working with Pres. Catanese).  Under the new system, there is a much better understanding of local needs and the board now has the decisionmaking authority to be more flexible in resolving issues.

Hopefully they won't obtain the rest of the signatures, but I just wanted you to know the perspective from "on the ground."

May 28, 2002 


Dear Governor Bush: 

   I read with interest the announcements of your creation of a Commission on Workers' Compensation Reform.  As you know from the correspondence received by your office throughout the past year injured workers throughout this state are in desperate need of immediate assistance with enforcement of laws pertaining to  the current system and are equally desperate for reform for the future. 

    VOICES is an organization of and for injured workers.  We actively participated in the Legislative Session(s) this past year and we sincerely want to be a part of the solution to fixing a very broken system.  We feel that because we have lived through both the good and the bad of Workers' Comp we are uniquely qualified to offer positive solutions that we believe will help injured workers and employers. 

     While you have appointed representatives of the attorneys who assist us, and representatives of organized labor who represent workers before and after they are injured on a multitude of issues, we feel that it is very important to have a member of the Commission who is an injured worker and who is connected to an organization of injured workers that is fully dedicated to the crisis that injured workers are in.  I respectfully request that you appoint me, as the President of VOICES, to serve in this role.  It would truly be an honor and a privilege to be a part of finding solutions that work for everybody.  Governor, I look forward to hearing from you on this very important matter. 


Sincerely,

Subject: Protecting Florida's Children


I applaud your efforts to look at how best to protect children left in the 
State's care. I do believe that better salaries and better training for the 
workers ( including the newly privatized ones) are part of the solution as 
well as a checks and balances system to verify the childrens' welfare and 
whereabouts.
Left out of the equation so far, however, is prevention.  The problem is that 
children are being born in increasing numbers to parents who haven't the 
foggiest idea or concept of responsibility on  how to take care of them nor 
any reasonable means to do so, i.e. drug and alcohol addicted, teen school 
dropouts, mentally disabled etc.
Working with these populations to require family planning goals would be 
controversial but I believe it is necessary. Every drug treatment program 
should include information on not having children until you have kicked the 
habit. Every stay-in-school program the same.
Blaming the problem solely on the state agency that is charged with dealing 
with consequences rather than attacking the causes will never do more than 
slighly alleviate the problem.
What do you think?

Subject: Child Care Training Bill


Dear Governor Bush,

A bill that was passed during the legislative session, SB 1550 - the
Silver/Ausley child care training bill, was sent up for your signature.
The child care resource and referral network throughout the state of
Florida wholly endorses this bill and recognizes the potential of this
legislation to improve child care quality.

We are extremely pleased with your interest in supporting the school
readiness of Florida's children.  This bill will require that those who
take the introductory required training and who work in licensed child
care programs be required to demonstrate their acquisition of the
information through a test or competency exam.  These are the people
charged with providing the care and school readiness of Florida's
children.  This is minimal.  In other industries and occupations, we
would not even question such an examination.  In fact, hair dressers and
nail technicians have to demonstrate more competence than those who care
for our youngest and most vulnerable citizens.

If we are going to improve the system and expect positive outcomes for
our children, we have to pay attention to those who are on the front
line with them daily.  I have personally  taught these courses.  It was
often frustrating to know that participants could sleep through the
classes and still receive their certificate that allowed them to work in
a licensed child care program.

Please help us "raise the bar" by signing this bill on behalf of
Florida's children.  I would be happy to provide more information.

Thank you.

Dear Jeb,

We are supposed to close on the acquisition of a nursing home operated
by IHS, which is in bankruptcy.  However,  we just learned that HB59E,
which is the bill that would provide an alternative to obtaining a lease
bond for nursing homes, has not yet been signed.  Lease bonds are
unobtainable in this industry, and we were planning on paying the fee
provided for in the bill in lieu of the bond.   We are told that we
cannot obtain a license without the bond, because the bill has not been
signed.

I would greatly appreciate it if you would let me know if you have any
suggestions regarding how we may proceed, or any estimate on when the
bill is likely to be signed.

I may be reached at 561-745-5600 (home) or 561-371-6647 (mobile).  Thank
you very much for your assistance, and I look forward to hearing from
you.

Subject: The nursing shortage


Dear Governor Bush:

I recently read an article regarding the serious nursing shortage in the state of Florida and the steps you were taking to help alleviate that shortage. As an operating room nurse in Ft. Myers, I, too, am concerned over the state of nursing in Florida.

There is no such thing as "season" in Ft. Myers, anymore. Lee Memorial Health System, HealthPark in particular, is busy year round. We have a very dedicated team, nurses, techs, poa's, alike. We work long hours and take many hours of call while dedicating ourselves to the care of fellow citizens. While it is admirable that you and others are trying to help by providing reimbursed tuition, and financial assistance in order to attend nursing school, it is important to note why the shortage exists.

Nurses, like teachers, are grossly underpaid. It is hard to believe that two of the most important professions are paid such " minimal" salaries. Don't get me wrong: I wouldn't change my profession for anything. I became a nurse four years ago at the age of 51. When I left New Jersey 11 years ago, I was making $16.50 per hour as a collections clerk for a large trucking firm. Last year, I finally surpassed that salary, after two years of nursing school and three years of part time attendance for my pre-requisites. Inflation is a part of the future, but the nursing salaries have not kept up with the rise in the cost of living. I always joke that slavery is still alive and well and living in the south. While our cost of living in Florida hasn't quite caught up with the Northeast, it is not that much cheaper anymore to reside in Florida. The salaries, however, of nurses and teachers is still way under what is considered decent. Healthcare workers provide a much needed job, but are not paid what they are worth. 

So, while I applaud what you and others are trying to accomplish to provdide Floridians with much needed nurses, please try to see what you can do about the salaries for the nurses. Pretty soon, the number of nurses will dwindle because we simply aren't paid enough for what we do and what we give. While we must maintain a license and are held responsible for our actions, we are not paid for the responsiblities we take.

Thank you.

I've written a poem in honor of my 30 years of service to Osceola County
Florida that I would like to share with you. I plan to retire in July of
2003.  I wrote to you and President Bush about 14 months ago inviting you to
come to St. Cloud to visit our Accelerated Math lab at Lakeview Elem.
School.  This is the best program I have ever seen or used for teaching
math.  The offer still stands if you would like to visit sometime.  
 
Either way, please enjoy the poem.  Get a hanky.
 

                                                Memories

	As I look back over these past 30 years,

	I've come to realize some of my fears.

	That one day I would no longer reach,

	Hundreds of children that I love to teach.

	Retirement looms closer with each passing day,

	I won't get to take them outside to play.

	I will miss showing them the wonders of space,

	And trying to beat them in a 100-yard race.

	Multiplication is something I will miss most,

	Beating my time is a reason to boast.

	Step right up, take a watch in your hand,

	Can you race against time, and beat the old man?

	I will miss lining up and heading for lunch,

	Eating was fun to be part of that bunch.

	I enjoyed seeing their enthusiasm and smiles,

	As the kids entered and walked down the aisles.

	My heart swells with pride, my feelings are blessed,

	When a grown student says, "You were the best.

	I had you in third grade a long time ago,

	You taught me to love math and I miss you so."

	To all the students I've taught in my profession,

	I just wanted to say "Thanks, but I have a confession.

	I couldn't have done it without:

	            Your willingness to learn,

	            Your acceptance of me as your
teacher,

	            The respect you showed me,

                                And your desire to be the best that
you could be."

Thank you. I too am concerned about that as well as the fact that 1/3 of our high school 10th graders failed the FCAT. I have asked Dr. Johnson to chat with me about this. I expect to receive an answer either tomorrow or certainly by Monday. I will share with you the content of the discussions
 
Rep. Arza and I have discussed his vision on stopping social promotion and holding all parties accountable to a child's test results.
 
On another note, at the request of the Dept of State ( I was flattered that I received a call from Ambassador Huddleston's office) asking me to meet with her today at the Breakers. Of course I met with her. She wanted to know if I would be interested in working on the following matter with her at the direction of President Bush.
 
To rebut Cuban children blaming us on the poverty levels in Cuba, they send on a monthly basis 2 sacks of Cuban rice to the DoS with a note reading "Mr. President, because of the US we are lacking in these types of essential food for us."
 
Ambassador Huddleston wanted to chat about how we could send back a stronger message. I suggested we have American children send books to Cuban children empowering them to experience the education we have here (with exception of this history exam here in PBC).
 
She loved the idea and modified it by saying books on "How to Start a Business" would be a direct hit to Castro. She said Cubans want to have a business and many do in the black market but lack the experience or fundamental aspects of running a business......
 
Anyway I thought I'd share with you the idea and perhaps it would be of use to you for the campaign here in South Florida. It obviously needs some tweaking, but I am looking forward to working on it...
 
Thanks again,

Subject: Fridays Miami visit

    I just left the United Teachers of Dade Stewards meeting, where I am a
Designated Steward. There will be some angry teachers waiting at the school
for your visit tomorrow. The deal is the School Board voted to take two days
pay pro-rated over the last six working days. It would be smart if you could
have some statement available in support of the Teachers. Such as "I wish
the School Board would have found a better way for resolving the budget
shortfall, that did not penalize the people who needed the money the most.
That the School Boards had told us that they could absorb the reduction in
funds without effecting pay when we made the cuts. It is sad that Miami-Dade
is the only county that thought to take the money from their employees."

I hope to God you get this in time, or that someone calls you on this.
In the name of Jesus Christ I pray.

Subject: Discrimination against Catholic Schools

Hello,

I was told that now because of the "10% of all public school kids get
into Florida State colleges law", it is now almost impossible for a
private / Catholic school child to get into a popular school such as
University of Florida or FSU regardless of their grades and SAT scores.
Is this true? I have already purchased the pre-paid college plan for my
son ( 4 years old). Is there any priority given to pre-paid student
admission at all? What does the 10% law state exactly? Can those 10% get
into the school of their choice, or is it on an availability basis?
Also, what is to stop kids switching to public schools during the last
month of their senior year, so they have a better chance of getting into
college? Finally, when is the 529 plan going to be available?

Maybe this policy wasn't thought out very well? I'm all in favor of
helping minorities and underprivileged kids get into school, but not at
the expense of people who plan, and save, and sacrifice. Looks like we
need to expand our capacity at the university level to be able to live
up to the promise we have made to educate the top 10% + educating the
people who think ahead & sacrifice so that their kids get a better
education, and become an even greater asset to the community.

Rep. Melvin called today and I promised I would pass along his
recommendation.
He says we should use the same model to review all DCF related laws as
we
did with school code. He said he and other members, staff, and exec.
branch
learned more from this process than anything they have ever done - and
it
led to an improved. streamlined and better school code. Thinks similar
benefits would flow from a DCF code review now - complete prior to next
regular session.

Subject: Chancellor of Public Schools



Dear Jeb,

I wanted to drop you a note about Major General Cliff Stanley, a man of
extraordinary honor, integrity and most importantly, leadership skills
demonstrated in a more than 30-year career in the military.  I had the
honor
of serving with him as a White House Fellow in your father's
administration.
For a significant part of his military tenure, his focus has been in the
area of education.  I believe that his unique combination of leadership
skills and educational experience make him an exceptional choice for the
position of Chancellor of Public Schools.

Cliff is bright, bold, and articulate and has risen to become the second
highest-ranking African American in the United States Marine Corps.  He
is
planning to retire in mid August 2002.  Briefly stated, Cliff has had
nothing short of a remarkable career.  His success and accomplishments
at
every endeavor he has set his mind to not only speaks volumes for his
talents and skills in situations and environments that can be considered
directly comparable to the requirements essential to the position of
Chancellor of Public Schools, but demonstrate clearly and compellingly
his
ability to work not only as a leader, but as a team player.

Cliff is the former Commanding General of what was the largest military
base
in the Marine Corp.  With a population of nearly 250,000 military
personnel,
for all practical purposes he can be viewed in this capacity as its
mayor.
He forged political ties with national and state elected officials, won
approval for housing development and was instrumental in the base’s
military
and civilian population being incorporated as part of a city, an
unprecedented accomplishment that led to increased revenue for the city,
as
well as better schools, roads and housing.  The military base had two
school
systems that Cliff was directly responsible for. For these myriad
accomplishments, in his honor the park next to City Hall was named after
him.

Cliff also has front line experience as a teacher.  He not only is
currently
responsible for all education and training for the entire Marine Corps,
more
than 240,000 marines, but he has taught at the United States Naval
Academy
and was previously in charge of the Marine Corps distance education
program.
Cliff is also media savvy. He earned his stripes in the field while in
charge of all public relations for the entire US Marine Corps.

In terms of character, integrity and morality, a Chancellor of Public
Schools is in a rare and wonderful position to be an example to our
state’s
impressionable and vital young citizens.  Cliff is an excellent role
model,
for all students, and certainly minorities.  I will share with you a
brief
tale of character and morality that I believe demonstrates qualities and
traits that children, as well as their parents, can appreciate and learn
from.

In 1975, Cliff was in Maryland at the public event with his wife, Roz
and
other family members, when sniper fire broke out.  When the smoke and
pandemonium cleared the killer had left his uncle dead and his wife, who
was
also shot, in critical condition.  Roz survived this racially motivated
attack but was paralyzed and to this day remains wheelchair bound. Cliff
escaped the bullets that day but carries the personal pain as well as
the
victories that often accrue to survivors of life and death
situations—and in
this case, the concept of commitment was born out of the tragedy
suffered by
his wife, to whom he remains faithfully married to this day and with
whom he
has a beautiful successful daughter -- Angie.  Cliff went on to have a
stellar career, and no doubt his sense of commitment is as much a part
of
his persona as the fibers of muscle he used to carry his wife to safety.

When you meet Cliff, and I hope at a minimum you take the opportunity to
get
acquainted, I think you will see that he is not only a gentlemen, but he
is
unequivocally a man of honor.  He has learned respect for people as well
as
institutions in some of this country’s most complex, challenging and
politically charged environments.  Most importantly, as an African
American
in the U.S. Marine Corps, in a racially difficult time, he rose to great
heights in the crucible of leadership.

I am confident that Major General Cliff Stanley could continue his
extraordinary service as a forthright commander on our behalf on the
education war that your administration is so boldly waging in Florida.
You
are probably also familiar with a recent trend across the United States
of
many cities and schools systems hiring former military officers to lead
struggling educational institutions to victory.   Major General John C.
Fryer, superintendent of Duval County Public Schools in Jacksonville,
Florida, served more than 30 years in the U.S. Air Force.  I believe
that
Cliff will proudly and successfully work with Jim Horne to wage an
education
campaign that serves both you and the students of this state with pride,
honor and most importantly, success.

Sincerely,

Charlie Garcia

Subject:	free gun-lockers for courthouses

    A Lawyer’s group is offering to provide free gun lockers wherever
state and/or federal laws are changed to allow gun lockers for the
public at courthouses.  Utah already has a law that requires courthouses

to provide gun lockers and The Lawyer’s Second Amendment Association
(LSAA) thinks Utah has a good idea that can spread with the
Association’s help.
    “We want to help provide lockers for the general public.” said
Attorney Rex Curry, a spokesman for LSAA and a member of the Libertarian

Party  “And of course, lawyers will also be able to use such lockers.
We will start wherever we can start in our ongoing effort to improve 2nd

amendment rights for anyone and everyone across the country.”
    Many states already allow concealed carry of firearms by the general

public, and many people have the right to carry concealed firearms, and
gun lockers will help achieve the purpose of CCF laws.
    “The law and the lockers are intended as a protection.” Curry said
“It's more dangerous for people to leave guns in cars or hide them
behind bushes.”
    “The recent past has caused government to treat citizens as the
enemy,” said Curry “We are helping to restore trust between public
officials and the general population.  And we want to improve the
publics perception of lawyers as supporting freedom, not destroying it.”

    The Utah law is in section 76-8-311.1 of the Utah Code and can be
viewed on the internet at
http://www.le.state.ut.us/~code/TITLE76/htm/76_0A026.htm
    The part that applies to courts is at
http://www.le.state.ut.us/~code/TITLE78/htm/78_0B007.htm
    The LSAA praises Arizona as another state that provides methods for
checking or storing firearms at government buildings as described in the

Arizona Republic.  A related article is at:
http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/0515GunCheck15.html
    The offer of free gun lockers isn’t for states that already have
lockers, says Curry.  It’s to help new states join the trend.

Brian, 

Secretary Chao would like to inform you that the State of Florida has been awarded a $945,945 dollar grant from the Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker Youth Program.  This program is designed to strengthen the ability of youth, ages 14-21, to obtain or retrain employment or to stabilize their employment by providing related assistance.  This program is integrated and coordinated through the workforce investment system.  These funds will be transferred from the Department of Labor to the Florida Department of Education next week.  

In addition, we want to make you aware the President Bush has proposed in the FY 2003 budget the consolidation of the Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker Program into the overall workforce investment system.  This program will no longer be offered as a national categorical program, but will be available to those states who want to continue this program through their local workforce investment boards.

If you have any questions please don't hesitate to call.

Dear Gov. Bush,

I read the article in todays  (5/31/02) Orlando Sentinel regarding the $8.5 
million needed by Osceola county to build more schools.

As you know we are the fastest growing school system in Florida and it's 
showing in how our kids are not getting an education.

For example:  My daughter completed 1st grade last year, was told by her 
teacher that she's a great student, learns very quickly and makes a great 
reading budding...well, nothing like lying to the parents to make them feel 
better.  My daughter entered 2nd grade this year and couldn't read her first 
word, she was never taught by her 1st grade teacher, and they passed her 
anyway because it looks bad on an overcrowded school to fail a student.  
Well, now that she has completed 2nd grade, she's not up to par to enter the 
3rd grade, per Sylvan Learning Center (at $40.00 per hour) and her teacher, 
but guess what, even though she hasn't met the minimum academic requirements, 
they're passing her anyway.  Again, can't make the overcrowded, non-educated 
teachers/schools look bad!

Take away that money, and you are killing the future of our children.  Just 
remember, when your old and feeble, they'll be running the country.  Now 
isn't that a form of terrorism?

Kim.....as you can see below, the intrusion into the California State
Network was   apparently  facilitated, in part, by a lack of senior
level
leadership's involvement and follow through with their IT folks.  

To make sure we are not similarly effected, i would suggest you send a
strong and very specific memo to each agency head reminding them of the
need
for them to personally review the safeguards in place in their
respective
systems, especially our pension and financial systems.  While i know you
have been working this issue for sometime, i think a reminder from
either
you or the Governor would be well placed.

Pls let me know how i can help.

Commissioner and others:
This evening I have been successful in reaching the Commander of the
Sacramento High-Tech Crimes Taskforce that is conducting the
investigation
into this matter.  While he is limited in what info he can release at
this
point, he did give me the following information:
1) The computers that were intruded upon are not unique in nature.  He
stated that there are over 4000 computers of this kind in use in the
U.S.
today.
2) The vulnerabilities that were exploited to access the personal data
were
very well known.
3) The computers in question were running operating systems (OS) that
had
not been updated or patched in a long time.  At least two (2) patches
for
the OS in operation had been released by the manufacturer and had not
been
loaded on the machines in question.
4) The managers of the agencies in question were trusting their IT
managers
and staff to conduct basic maintenance of the system and thought that
same
had been conducted.  The managers were very surprised that their systems
were not patched.  The commander said that this was very basic "computer
hygiene" that had been neglected.
5) Two of the computers that were violated were sitting outside of the
firewalls and thus totally unprotected.  
The commander indicated that when they could talk more about the
specifics
of this case they would call me back and give us greater details.  In
the
interim, I would suggest that all Florida agencies ensure that they are
closely following the Trusecure guidelines that would have prevented
this
situation.

Growth Management Bill Signing.  Told her I would do my best, but didn't

The Honorable Jeb Bush
Governor
The State of Florida
The Capitol
Tallahassee, Florida  32399-0001

VIA FACSIMILE:  (850) 921-9077

Dear Governor Bush:

I was both pleased and perplexed to learn that you have chosen Orange County
as the location where you will sign into law the recently passed Growth
Management bill. 

I am pleased because Orange County is wrestling with many growth related
issues and has been at the forefront of tackling one of the most pressing of
those issues - overcrowded schools.  Therefore, it is an honor that you
would choose Orange County for this event.

Nonetheless, I am perplexed because the Orange County Board of County
Commissioners recently unanimously passed a resolution petitioning you to
urge the legislature to revisit several detrimental aspects of the growth
management bill during the recently completed special session and, to my
knowledge, we have never received a response from you or your office
regarding our concerns or petition.  

To reiterate the concerns expressed in our resolution, the judicial review
component of the bill will, at a minimum, stifle public involvement and
undermine the public's ability to provide valuable input into the decisions
made by local governments.  Furthermore, Section 163.3194 of the Growth
Management bill obstructs local governments' ability to deny permits for
landfills. And, on a matter with which you are very familiar, we continue to
support your previous efforts to encourage other counties to follow Orange
County's lead in denying applications to land-use changes and rezoning
applications where the result would be to exacerbate school overcrowding.

The Honorable Jeb Bush
May 30, 2002
Page 2




In light of your decision not to seek changes during the special session and
to sign this bill into law tomorrow, please reconsider our concerns about
the detrimental aspects of this bill.  Please send a letter urging the
legislature to amend, during the 2003 legislative session, the sections of
the bill that obstruct both the ability of the public and local government
to ensure compatible, responsible land-use decisions in the future.

Thank you for your commitment to the citizens of the State of Florida and
your favorable consideration of this request.  We stand ready to support
your continued efforts to foster growth management legislation that reduces
school overcrowding.

Sincerely,




Teresa S. Jacobs

Please approve item # 3139A endorsed by Senator Rudy Garcia and recommended by both Chambers. It is important to preserve our Spanish culture and maintain excellence in Spanish theatrical presentations.

Attachments:	opn98-0009.txt; opn91-0062.txt; opn90-0012.txt

Ms. Anderson:

I am attaching two opinion letters (90-0012 and 98-0009) which address
the issues to which you refer.  According to the opinion letters:

The floating home or floating structure is considered TPP.  As such, it
is not eligible for homestead exemption because the Constitution limits
the homestead exemption to real property.  

Opinion letter 91-0062 has been attached as relevant to your inquiry
about uniformity when taxing mobile homes.  According to this opinion
letter, the mobile home or park trailer is taxed as real property when
the owner has permanently affixed it to the land he owns.  Again the
homestead exemption can apply if the mobile home is considered real
property.

Regarding other exemptions that may be applicable, it is difficult to
respond without knowing specific circumstances.  Please refer to the TPP
guidelines, section V. page 29, to determine if any situation applies to
your client.  Not mentioned in the guidelines but, perhaps, applicable,
is section 196.202, F.S., regarding widows, widowers, blind and disabled
exemptions that apply to TPP. 

Also, according to sections 328.68, 328.69, and 328.70, F.S., (prior to
1999, found in Chapter 327, F.S.) if the floating homes qualifies as a
vessel, it is exempt from TPP tax but is subject to a vessel
registration fee.

I hope this information is helpful.  

>>> "cps1" <cps1@flash.net> 05/30/02 07:26AM >>>
Connie Frank -

A taxpayer has asked for information about "floating homes," which are
being taxed as tangible property in his county. He asks if it is legal,
and whether there are any exemptions applicable to floating homes .

If it is legal, it seems to me to be not uniformly applied. Please
comment on this aspect, since mobile homes appear to be treated
differently while the principles of both seem to be exactly identical.

And, it is legal, then would not homestead and other such exemptions be
applicable if a floating home is a permanent residence in Florida and is
taxed? Please comment on this.

I request your responses asap by email. 

Thank you.

Subject: Workers Compensation Reform Commission


Hon. Governor,
       I believe that there needs to be input from VOICES to the reform 
commission. I believe that input needs to be consistent. I believe that a 
representative from VOICES, the same designated person, should be able to 
attend each commission session and have the opportunity to be heard and to 
organize a coherent and non-redundant presentation by injured workers. 
       I believe the efficient operation of this important commission can be 
achieved by appointing Mary Bailey, President of VOICES as a designated 
representative of injured workers. I do not believe the commission needs to 
be expanded nor any current appointee replaced. I do believe that funds 
should be allocated for travel and other per diem so that Ms. Bailey could 
afford to attend each session and participate in the commissions work. 
       The commission studying workers' compensation issues must not hear 
scattered horror stories from injured workers, they should hear the VOICE of 
injured workers as presented in a coherent and consistent manner.
       I urge you to make Mary Bailey a non-voting "member" of the commission 
or a member of the staff with full access, travel and per diem allowance. 
Thank you, 
       Respectfully,

       Mark L. Zientz, Esq. 
       Member of the Board of FWA, Member of the Board of WILG, Member of the 
Executive Council of the Workers' Compensation Section of the Florida Bar,

I was very disappointed in your veto.  The existing structure for protecting lakes in eastern Citrus county has been a dismal failure.
 
We moved to FL 3 years ago to a home on Floral City Lake.  The drought is not the only reason that water levels have been low, but I won't get into all the details.  The only time SWMD released any water, we got 7 feet in 2 weeks and it killed all our fish.  In a matter of months it's all gone again.
 
Citizens have very little opportunity to try to influence the bureacracy.  To my knowledge they've never had any public forums where they make themselves available and provide information.  If it wasn't for TOO FAR, my opinion is that the devestation would be worse.  You cannot imagine the demoralizing effect this situation has had on lake/canal property owners - although you may be aware of the economic impact.

this a little explination of this nightmare

( 1) in 1996 a so called church or center come to community. and never cared about community untill 1996.

(2) a donation given to community by adesa an action company. to a lady that lived in vista verde she went to betty ferguson commitioner because she did not have a tax ID NUMBER the commicioner ask UNIVERSAL TRUTH CENTER to take over this donation money. who is betty ferguson to give this money to complete stranger that never cared of this community at all but boy did they love us then they started harrasing the community and thinking that they were god and that we had to do as they said or they would take our lives and they did.

(3) universal truth center take donation and starts planing with our money without notifying home owners. and acks as trustee with out notice, with a board of their chuch and the attorney of thier chuch seeking there best interest, ( association not active) and timberlake management group. company to manage what not theirs. plus all their influence.

Hola Jeb:

As you know, this next June 10 there will be a Grassroots conference for
people of ALL disabilities in Orlando.  I understand that the Secretary
of State will also be attendance to celebrate Florida's national historic
accessibility voting bill.  National historic, because it exceeds federal
requirements, and is accessible to all disabilities.  I also understand
that when that is taking place in Orlando, you will be having a ceremony
about the same bill, but that the advocates that drafted that bill will
not be able to be there because they will all be in Orlando at the
grassroots forum.  Is there any possibility that you could conduct your
planned ceremony in Orlando?  I think is important that people of all
disabilities feel your presence.  Because most of them are democrats,
this is a good time for you to show your presence with them as well. 
PLEASE talk to people from your External Affairs about it.  I am copying
Karen, and Mike to see if they can do something about it.

Carinos,

Berthy

Subject:	Soda Apple / Ard

Governor:
The tropical soda apple problem is principally a problem on privately owned
ranch lands, not on public lands.  Of over 500 applications received by DEP
from public land agencies, only one sought assistance for this problem.  

The issue at hand is a $103,000 budget item at the Dept. of Agriculture for
IFAS to work on developing a biological control (i.e., a bug) for this
nuisance plant.  It is important to put this in perspective.

Based on other experiences developing biological controls, we expect this to
be a 5 to 10 year effort that will cost $10 to $15 million.  While every
little bit will help, $103,000 really will not make not much of a difference
to this effort.

I think the question is: "If the $103,000 is cut from the Agriculture budget,
could DEP TRANSFER some of its resources to IFAS for this purpose?"

I would advise against this because: 1) the amount will not make a material
difference; 2) this is principally a problem on private, not public lands; 3)
IFAS has never sought resources from DEP's trust funds for this purpose
before; 4) should we create this precedent, IFAS will likely come back every
year looking to tap these Florida Forever dollars for this project to assist
a particular group of private landowners; 5)IFAS can apply through the
existing competitive application process for funding for this project, as
they currently do with other invasive species management projects.

Finally, the fact that neighboring states may quarantine Florida cattle
before allowing them to be transferred to pasture is not going to be
influenced by whether or not $103,000 is or is not spent on a long-term,
multi-million dollar research project.  (In fact, Texas already quarantines
Florida cattle for 17 days so that all othe Soda Apple seeds pass through the
animal before they are transferred to Texas ranches.)

Mike Joyner knows more about this and has spoken to Chris Flack about this.
They are available if you have any questions.

If the $103,000 cut is critical for other purposes, then I would make the cut
from Agriculture's budget.  If it is not, I would leave it in since I know it
is a priority for Commissioner Bronson who himself has personally dealt with
the problem of Soda Apples.  

I would not create the precedent of transferring DEP's Florida Forever
dollars to IFAS for this type of research project.  IFAS can, of course,
apply for funding from this program as any other public agency.

Governor Bush,
        As you might recall, you appointed me to the Board of Collier County Commissioners in November 2001 without any restriction on my ability to run for election in November 2002.
        We have  made a lot of progress in the past 6 months and I have made the decision to seek election in order to continue the work we have begun.
        We spoke briefly about this at the Lincoln Day Dinner on April 13. I would like to obtain your permission to use, in my campaign literature, the photograph taken of us at that time. I have widespread support in Collier County and I do not believe the use of the photo would interfere in any way with your campaign; however I will respect any decision you make concerning this matter.
        Thanks, again, for the confidence you have shown in me.
 
 
                                                            Sincerely,

Ms. Bailey,  The Governor forwarded me your e-mail and asked me to respond.
As you know, in addition to the two labor union representatives, the
Governor also appointed the President of the Florida Workers' Advocates, an
organization which represents the interests of injured workers before the
Legislature.  Unfortunately, whenever this office creates a task force or
commission, there are people we would like to appoint but are unable to do
so simply due to the need to keep the number on a commission manageable.
However, the Commission will be holding public hearings throughout the state
to obtain input from as many interested citizens as possible.  You may also
meet with Commission members individually to provide input.  There will be a
link to the Commission on the Governor's web page which will announce the
schedule of meetings.  I look forward to working with you and your members
as the Commission proceeds with its work.

Department of Commerce was notified today by attorneys for Mexican growers that they are pulling out of suspension agreement on tomatoes. Our growers as well as Commerce official are shocked, after all we had all hoped to renew the agreement.

Commerce will revert back to investigation of dumping action with dumping margins of 18%. The case will ultimately go to the USITC where the Mexicans are confident they will win. Most of these will occur between now and November and will have political implications. The Mexican industry just got cocky after they observed the USITC treat us with the Canadian dumping case and believe they will get the same treatment. The Florida growers are saying the Mexican government is backing their growers, the Canadian Government is backing their growers, where is the Bush administration going to be on this?

Governor Bush,
I applaud your recent environmental progress regarding Gas and Oil Drilling in the state of Florida, but you can't stop there.  The Ichetucknee River is one of the most beautiful in the world, and a tremendous tourist attraction drawing 200,000 visitors per year, which are vital to local businesses.  By approving the construction of a cement kiln 3 miles from the river you risk destroying one of the premier outdoor recreation areas in the state.  The emmisions from the it's smokestacks will harm the river which already has high advisory levels of mercury.  The increased truck traffic to the area can only cause damage to the river and it's surrounding habitat which supports many species of rare wildlife.  I first canoed the Ichetucknee River when I was 1 year old with my parents and I am still amazed by its beauty.  
So Please Reconsider This Potentially Disastrous Decision.
Thank You For Your Time

Half right in history gets A 
By Kimberly Miller, Palm Beach Post Staff Writer
Thursday, May 30, 2002
Palm Beach County high school students taking a new standardized history exam this week need to answer just over half of the 100 questions correctly to get an A grade on the test; to earn a B, only 39 correct answers are required.
In fact, to pass the test with a D, a student needs to answer only 23 questions correctly.
The new final exam for American and world history classes was developed by school district officials to ensure students learn state required lessons that include history about women, Africans, African-Americans and the Holocaust. The questions -- including about 15 on African-American history -- are multiple choice. The history program has been required since 1999.
The 100-question tests -- specific to Palm Beach County -- replace the individual final exams that teachers create themselves. The district, which recommended the scale, sent letters to schools giving them the option to use it on the new test. Many said they will, while teachers in some schools said the issue has not been discussed yet. It will be for this year only.
But some teachers were concerned about the low passing scale, especially for students who missed 10 days or more of school during the year and had to pass the test to show "mastery" of the subject, or fail the class. Does answering 29 to 38 questions correctly out of 100 to get a C show mastery, some asked.
"I don't think if you administer a valid test and a kid misses half of the questions, that they should pass," said Thomas O'Brien, a social studies teacher at Lake Worth High School. "I think there is unwarranted panic on the part of some people who feel like they didn't want to be ambushed."
The typical grading scale awards an A for 90 percent or more questions correct, a B for 80 percent to 89 percent correct, a C for 70 percent to 79 correct and a D for 60 percent to 69 percent correct.
To fail the new standardized history exam this year with an F grade, a student would have to miss 78 of the 100 questions. 
School board member Debra Robinson, who introduced the idea of using a standardized history exam last fall, said she's OK with the grading scale this year, because it's the first time the district is using the exam.
Final exams are worth 20 percent of a student's grade. It's possible, Robinson said, if a student failed the new test, to fail the class for the year.
"This is the year of change and transition and it's really, in my mind, the warm-up year," Robinson said. "When you have massive change, it takes people time to adjust."
Robinson said she also heard concerns from teachers who felt they didn't get information about the exam until it was too late to adequately prepare their students.
Ana Meehan, executive director of academic programs, said teachers should have received, in January, sample tests, African and African-American history lessons, and charts of deadlines on what needed to be taught and when. A handful of schools that used the exam in a pilot program first semester received the information before school started.
Also, Meehan acknowledged, most of the information given to teachers covers subjects that they should have been teaching anyway, based on the Sunshine State Standards. The state standards outline exactly what a student should learn at each grade level. 
The scores from this year's test will be evaluated and changes to the test or scoring scale could be made, Meehan said. 
"We're hoping this year to get baseline data from the scores, but also information from teachers such as whether the test is aligned to the textbook," Meehan said. 
William T. Dwyer High School Principal David Culp questions the low passing rate on the grading scale. He understands it's the first year for the history test, but said even a student guessing at most questions should get 25 percent right. 
"If I have an educated guess, I could get 30 to 40 percent correct," he said.

Hi Governor,

 

A few months ago I sent you an email about the possibility of your awarding a Points of Light award to Organ Donors (both living and diseased) and their families (Organ Donor Families) in recognition of the tremendous sacrifice that they have and do make to all of us by giving the most precious gift…. The gift of life.

 

The United States National Transplant Games will be held later this month in Orlando (June 25th to June 30th) and that would present a great opportunity to make the presentation.  It would be great if you or a surrogate could be there for the opening ceremonies or at some point during the competition to present the award.

 

Hope it is in the works.

 

Warmest, friendly regards,

Dear Governor Bush,

I realize this falls outside the realm of appropriate protocol so I beg
your indulgence in making this personal appeal for your consideration.
The Florida Children's Forum convenes an annual leadership conference.
This year, it is scheduled for October 23 - 25 in Kissimmee at the
Hyatt.

On the evening of October 23rd at 6:30 p.m., we will host a Leadership
Awards Dinner to recognize the leadership efforts on behalf of
children.  Representatives of school readiness coalitions, businesses,
and the legislature will be honored.  You are our chief leader as the
Governor of Florida.  It would such an honor to have you speak a few
moments to the attendees to encourage those engaged in these school
readiness efforts.  I anticipate an audience of at least 500.  If the
dinner presents a scheduling conflict, we will be convening the
conference on the morning of the 23rd at 10:00 a.m.  Again, it would be
such an honor to have you greet and welcome those attending.

David Lawrence was our wonderful keynote speaker last year.  In a major
systemic shift to a model of local control with our school readiness
movement, it is so important to recognize emerging leaders to encourage
and support innovation on behalf of children.  Your acknowledgment of
their efforts would speak volumes.

I hope you will be able to join us.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Phyllis Kalifeh, President/CEO

Melbourne, FL  32941-9000

Your May 19 special report, "School funding:  Is it a crisis?" provided an
exhaustive yet nevertheless incomplete and misleading portrait of Florida's
funding commitment to public education.  

It's true that public education saw deep cuts in the early 90s.  But it is
Florida's more recent funding record that should be most relevant to your
readers and most important in evaluating whether our schools are currently
in "crisis."  These are the facts about Florida's public schools over the
past four years:

Funding is up.  Our four-year funding record - in the aggregate, per
student, with inflation, however you want to count it - is better than that
of either of my predecessor's two terms.  And while real
(inflation-adjusted) per-student spending in Florida declined over the eight
years of the previous administration, under our watch, it has gone up.
Per-student funding was even up last year, despite the economic slowdown and
terrorist attacks.  In Brevard County, for example, we have increased public
school funding by 24 percent over four years, or 17 percent per student.

Your special report repeatedly compares where we are now with where we were
10, 12 or 15 years ago, but not with where we were just four years ago.  You
repeatedly compare Florida with other states - using apples to oranges
comparisons, by the way - but not Florida today with Florida four years ago.
It is Florida's four-year funding record that is most relevant, and most
extraordinary.

Can we spend more?  Should we spend more?  Yes, which is why I look forward
to soon signing a state budget that will provide a $1.1 billion increase for
Florida's public schools.  This represents a one-year increase in total K-12
funds of 9 percent and a per-student increase of 6 percent, a rate two to
three times the projected rate of inflation.  In Brevard County, that works
out to an additional $265 per student next year.

The true "crisis" in Florida's educational system is that no matter how much
we spend, some still see spending as the primary (or even the sole)
criterion for judging excellence in our public schools.  Student achievement
is the key, and any funding increase is squandered if it does not yield
greater achievement and greater accountability.

Fortunately, under the A+ Plan and our other visionary reforms, Florida's
student achievement is rising.  FCAT scores in many areas show great
improvement - including in Brevard County -- and this year we have raised
school grading standards because our teachers, administrators, parents and
students excelled under the original standards and proved they are ready to
meet the next challenge.

The "crisis" in Florida's public schools lies behind us, not in front of us,
unless we return to the policies that created the crisis in the first place.



Sincerely,



Jeb Bush

the following article appeared today discussing the newly released Commerce data. 

http://www.floridatoday.com/!NEWSROOM/localstoryA20458A.htm 

I have several comments: 
(1) Though this may not really matter that much, the article says the revenue numbers are taxes per capita.  This is incorrect.  These are all revenues, including federal funds.

(2) This is a crude interstate comparison, in which no adjustments are made for interstate differences in: 
        --cost-of-living or cost-of-inputs, 
        --functional responsibilities between state and local governments (looking at combined state and local government spending and revenues solves this problem)

        --demographic composition. 

Failing to adjust for demographic composition can be particularly important with respect to school spending.  Because Florida's school aged population as a percent of total state population is low compared to the U.S. average, a simple per capita comparison makes Florida spending look artificially low.  

The conclusions drawn from a simple per capita comparison of state government only, is methodologically questionable.

May 29, 2002

Governor Jeb Bush,

In an act of complete and utterly disgusting malfeasance, my
fourteen-year-old child was seized under color of law by a
Department of Children and Family Services protective investigator
who seemed to be more interested in her own personal agenda of
increasing the number of placements made with openly gay custodians,
than she was in the safety and well being of my child.  My son was
forced to go into the custody of a malicious, predatory, conniving,
pedophilic homosexual who had ALREADY been reported to the DCFS for
his inordinate attempts to "LURE" my child.

The man had no job and hadn't worked in nearly a year!  He lived at
the apartment of a local stripper who worked at Club Madonna at
South Beach.  Neighbors say she also worked as a prostitute.  Many
of the neighbors, not only reported these things to the DCFS and the
Florida Abuse Hotline, but they also reported that these two
unmarried, DCFS-chosen "Caregivers" (NEITHER of whom was an American
Citizen) were regularly using illegal drugs and having Ecstasy
Parties in their apartment!

The Miami Beach Police Department, subsequently, informed me that
this pedophilic homosexual was under investigation for the sexual
molestation of my child.  This man has since fled to avoid being
brought in on "pedophile" charges - and, now, cannot be found.  The
stripper has disappeared as well, it seems.  The DCFS came before
the Honorable Judge Cindy Lederman and said that they were moving my
child: because the Caregiver's mother had taken sick; and, therefore
this Caregiver had to leave the United States - so he would be
returning to his own country to see his sick mother.  This was
absolutely and completely false information!

While under the care of these DCFS-recommended Caregivers, my child
was repeatedly offered drugs and even "FORCED" to inhale drug smoke,
on at least one occasion.  The DCFS had already been made well aware
(by many concerned people from our neighborhood) of the imminent
dangers of this placement.  They responded by pompously * YELLING *
at me in the court room of Judge Lederman that the homosexual would
NOT BE SEXUALLY MOLESTING MY CHILD and that there was nothing
illegal about their placing my child with a stripper/lap
dancer/alleged prostitute.  The DCFS contended that this foreigner
(who, it was arrogantly bragged, could bring in
one-thousand-dollars-OR-MORE-a-night from her "catering" business)
could provide a better, more wholesome home for my child.

Both the stripper and this pedophilic homosexual reported that they
were making their living by working as "food caterers," when they
had asked for Custody of my child.  The DCFS investigative
protector, her DCFS Supervisor, and the accompanying Police Officer
all witnessed the evidence of this blatantly fraudulent report that
had been made by these two prospective Caregivers.  This unlawful
fraud, all the warning calls from the neighbors, and the obviously
questionable characters of these two prospective Custodians WERE
PURPOSELY OVERLOOKED and CONVENIENTLY IGNORED; and they were given,
at the recommendation of the DCFS, legal custody of my child.

THE ABUSE OF MY CHILD STILL CONTINUES, even now, under the
State-paid care of the DCFS!   My child, since being moved from the
pedophilic homosexual's custody, has been BEATEN UP and EVEN HAD HIS
EAR TORN!  No one seems to care!  Certainly, the DCFS is not going
to make these things known to the public.  My child was forced, by
the DCFS, to live in five different locations and was required to
attend three different schools within the first five months of his
"protective" care.  Now, he's failing in school and has decided that
he no longer even wants to go to college.

It has been eight months; and I still have not been allowed to
present my side of the story, in court - nor have I been allowed to
visit my child, a single time.  I have been repeatedly threatened,
at the instigation of the DCFS, that if I even try to speak a single
word in my defense in the court room - then, they will have me
arrested on the very spot (right in the court room, itself!).

The DCFS even made a concerted attempt to pursue a course of
"malicious prosecution" against me for my efforts to try and protect
my child from their irresponsible, negligent and abusive placement.
They actually brought formal charges against me and tried to have me
arrested for reporting my fears - of the possible dangers of their
placement - to the Florida Abuse Hotline.  The police, thank God,
saw the absurdity of these malicious charges and threw them out!

The DCFS still holds my child and staunchly refuses to allow him to
appear in court, to refute the false and slanderous allegations
still being held against me. The reason given by DCFS is that a
court appearance would be "too stressful" for my child (even though
he has specifically asked to be present).  There is no Guardian ad
Litem, that I know of, on the case; and there seems to be no way to
halt the DCFS' relentless abuse or to defend ourselves against their
spiteful, venom-spitting, ass-covering lies and continual
falsification of reports.

The first five times I went to court there were FOUR DIFFERENT
JUDGES presiding!  SEVEN different lawyers have ALREADY handled my
case.  Once, I had TWO State-appointed lawyers assigned to my case
AT THE VERY SAME TIME (for nearly a month) - one of whom, I had no
idea had even been assigned to represent me.

I now have no money and, therefore, cannot carry out the necessary
depositions; because my last State-appointed lawyer failed to show
up for the Pre-trial Hearing and has, repeatedly, refused to give me
an appointment for legal counsel.  This lawyer was appointed to my
case on Feb 26th of 2002.  It's now almost June, and this
State-appointed lawyer has only seen me once (back on April the 9th
of 2002) - for 20 minutes!  He has stubbornly refused to give me
another appointment; admitting that what they pay him is nothing but
"chicken-feed."  This man gets regular referrals by being on the
Juvenile Dependency Wheel (and probably, in reality, doesn't want to
"rock the boat" of his employees by revealing the abusive atrocities
that have been perpetuated against my son, during the DCFS' handling
of this case).

I HAVE NO HOPE; unless someone hears my plea for help --- against
this out-of-control, all-powerful, child welfare system that is
malevolently destroying our society, family by family, with their
un-assailed incompetence and spiteful "manufacturing" of slanderous
allegations to support their ever-growing "Abuse Industry," which
has so out-stripped it's original purposes that it is now, in many
cases, actually waging an unjustified and certainly unwelcome "war"
against the good citizens of our State.

Subject:	Re: We have just begun to fight.

For all those that worked on HB 1307,
    Governor Bush has signed HB 1307. :**(
    I want to thank you all for standing by your convictions and always 
keeping what is best for individuals with disabilities and the people of 
Florida as your driving force. Personally, I am Republican, and can't tell 
you how devastated I am with Governor Bush and his staff for the signing of 
HB 1307. I believed he would always put the concerns and safety of the people 
of Florida first. 
    There were so many emails and faxes and letters sent from our community. 
There is a letter that is supposed to be distributed with the bill, and I 
suppose there will be an explanation, but to take our community backwards 
toward discrimination and unequal access is inexcusable. The way this 
amendment got on the bill is unacceptable. There was nothing on the bill that 
had to go through this session, and our lives will be irreversibly changed 
because of the inaccessibility that the bill will allow.
    For those of you who tried to bring it to the Governor's attention, 
Thank-you. I appreciate the time and the heart that went into your efforts. I 
wish he had veto'd the bill, but since he hasn't, I'll let you know if there 
is anything we can do to recover the lost accessibility. 
    Please forward to anyone you know that had the integrity and fortitude to 
help individuals with disabilities keep Florida's accessibility standards.
Blessings,

Below, please find a copy of Admiral Natter's bio for Governor's meeting on
Tuesday morning at 8:15.  

Admiral Natter's visit with Governor is a courtesy call.  He can be expected
to brief the Governor on Navy's plans to utilize Florida-based assets to
conduct preparedness training (Key West, Pensacola, Eglin Range, and Avon
Park).  We have been working with the Navy (and to some extent Eglin AFB)
for over a year on bringing increased training missions to the state where
feasible. Upwards of $700 million in next few years is expected to come here
as a result.  Attached, please find a press release by Governor on this
issue. 

Also attached below is a Navy public affairs plan addressing their proposed
use of the Gulf Coast Range Complex.  The Navy put this together per my
request so that we could jointly use it to address any potential issues
regarding future Navy use of the range.  I have arranged for Katie, Liz,
Brian, Lisa, and David to meet on Tuesday morning with the Atlantic Fleet
Public Affairs Officer while Governor is with Admiral Natter to discuss any
outstanding concerns, issues, scenarios, etc.

Finally, on Monday, I am hosting a community-based meeting in Bay County
where Admiral Natter and Tyndall AFB leadership will meet with community and
business leaders.  This meeting will be followed by an editorial board where
local press can ask relevant questions pertaining to Navy co-training with
Air Force on Eglin range--and how that will impact Tyndall area.  This
meeting came about as a result of an email that William Harrison sent to the
Governor with concerns that Tyndall would be negatively impacted by shared
services use of range.  Since that email, we have resolved all concerns and
this community meeting should be a love fest.  Governor is credited with
being responsible guy who resolved this well for all concerned.

Subject: here's the complete story.........COPY> ...Tampa News

Dear Sirs,
 we have a great story for your investigative news team. 
This is going on during the states massive budget cuts.

My name is Rick West and I’m the PSA chairman for the Tampa chapter of the Florida Motion Picture and Television Association and my daughter Christy was a victim of an on going Modeling agency scam in the Tampa bay area.
By Networking with another victim Mrs. Gina Hughes> 813-685-6094 and with help from the Florida Bluesheet a concerned trade publication 
>407-292-7458 we learned about #42 other victims within Florida and in Georgia.  

We have uncovered a clear pattern of fraud that prays on the dreams of the children and adults both young and old in Tampa and Atlanta.

Now here’s the real story. 
It’s been well over a year since the ST. Pete Times exposed the fact that the Department of Professional Regulation in Tallahassee whom is charged with enforcing the talent agency licensing laws under Chapter 468 of the State Statute and the DPR has failed to do so allowing these scams to continue unabated.  
Additionally, we have uncovered an agency that fails to bring any action to protect the public when violations of law are reported to them. 

Case in point,
 Model 2000 Inc. ran a continuous advertisement under the General help wanted section of a local newspaper for modeling and acting jobs. 
When people phoned them they were told to come in for an interview. 
At the interview they filled out an employment application, which also asked if they had any current comp cards and which they were promptly told that they needed to have done for these jobs. 
To sell these expensive 800.00 plus comp cards
many people were promised and guaranteed modeling assignments with the JC. Penny Company for their catalogs and they were told that “they would make back the comp card fees in no time” along with other such employment. 
Model 2000 Inc. claimed to have an Atlanta partner who handled this for the JC. Penny Company and most clients were given a list of other agencies to send the comp cards to. Model 2000 inc. claimed to send them out too.

Most of the victims reported that they were never called for any auditions and or, jobs by Model 2000 Inc. or by anyone else.
And after repeated phone calls to them some were told “that things were slow right now” while they ran the continues help wanted ad or that Model 2000 Inc. didn’t remember them or that they needed to buy more comp cards from Model 2000 Inc. 
And, when 50% of the comps cards that we sent out came back we called agents who told us that the comp cards were of a poor quality and that agents only keep one and throw the rest way. 
Clearly, contrary to state law,
 Model 2000 Inc. makes money from these comp cards and not by commissions.  

 We later discovered that Model 2000 Inc. had an un-registered office in Atlanta and we obtained a letter from the JC. Penny legal counsel stating that Model 2000 Inc.
 must stop using the JC. Penny name because they had no right to do so.
They were in fact offering non-existent jobs.
   
And, we later learned that Model 2000 Inc. was in direct violation of Chapter 468 because they didn’t give clients the required contracts or fee schedules and they didn’t keep client contact records nor did they post the required information in the business. 

 What they were doing was running a photo service outside of the offices on Gandy ave during hours that they weren’t listed to operate in according to their filed combo commission schedule/ hours of operation. 
 Chapter 468 prohibits these agencies from charging photo or registration fees yet every client was sold these expensive comp cards.
And, Model 2000 Inc. has a photo service occupational license. 

Model 2000 Inc. tried to tell Judge Eric Meyers that photo receipts were valid contracts. Judge Meyers ruled that both parties did not dually sign them nor were they the contracts required under chapter 468. 
However, verbal contracts are legal in Florida so Model 2000 Inc. will be held accountable for their pattern of promising the advertised non-existent employment.  
 
We have obtained a letter from a photographer who was an employee of Model 2000 Inc. regarding Model 2000 Inc. selling these to people that didn’t meet the industry requirements to Model.
 
This Photographer stated that he and the makeup person were paid 25.00 per person to take these photos. 
We found that the average printing cost was 100.00 and most people paid over 800.00 each for these comp cards. 
We learned that the photo receipts needed to show sale tax on it and they don’t. 
And, we learned by discovery that Model 2000 Inc was shooting 10-20 people a weekend for these comp cards at 800.00 ave. each but that they were only reporting making 6k and 9K for the last two years.  
This is ripping off Florida’s  children and the tax payers too.  

The DPR states that the complainants must use their forms and must contact them.  
We have learned that both the BBB and the DPR have suppressed prior complaints made against this company.

The Tampa Police Departments Economic Crimes Unit has interviewed many of the victims however the DPR refuses to contact them regarding these complaints of grand theft and fraud yet they claim to protect this states consumers.
 The State Attorney will get this case.




Most of the victims were kids that have been ripped off here. 
We learned that other talent agents sit on the regulating board and they admit to having limited power because they can’t get restitution nor shut down such scams. 
Therefore, these agencies have a state license to steal.

 
We have an upcoming civil trial in Tampa and have filed criminal complaints with TPD, the DPR and with the Florida Attorney Generals office. 
The Florida Attorney General said that we did every thing right but I learned that they wondered why the DPR who was charged with handling the case wasn’t doing anything for the 42 reported victims of this scam.
We received a letter from the DPR that they were waiting to take action until the civil case was over. 
The staff Attorney for the DPR explained that it was because they didn’t want to file in piece meal. 
Criminal action isn’t civil action so they should charge the business with fraud.
Other states have closed down these scams and the companies have moved to Florida. Any wonder why? 

We know that there are many more victims in the Tampa area so we are asking for your help with this urgent matter. 
I have a file that’s a foot thick with documents regarding supporting evidence to backup all statements and claims made within this letter. 
Sincerely,
 Rick West  727-862-0133

Subject: Florida Air Guard "lands" Personnel Conference for Orlando

Governor,

The Florida Air Guard, led by Brig Gen Titshaw and Col Balskus, has landed a
600+ person conference in Orlando later this year. This is the annual
Military Personnel Conference.  As you know, we lean forward in hosting
conferences in Florida for obvious reasons....tourist, travel, and a chance
to showcase your Fla Guard and our great state.

Various states make presentations to host conferences.  We have been very
successful during the past year in getting our share of the business.  We
are looking at a couple of "big" ones next year.

Regards,

Doug

Governor: I'm doing great- thanks for asking!  I am enjoying putting together a whole year of classes for the medical students on health policy, and writing articles, etc.  The family is healthy, growing, and sassy....the latter to be expected with two teenage girls in the same house:)

We have set up a statewide conference on terrorism for Monday, September 9th at the Turnbull Center.  I know you have Florida Missing Children day that morning, but any chance you would honor us with a short visit (and say a few words) after lunch?  John Agwunobi is going to be there, and Tim Moore said he'll be there in the afternoon.  Craig Fugate has agreed to speak, and we're trying to also get a national speaker like DA Henderson, or Tom Ridge.  It will be only two days before the anniversary of 911, and I think there will be press interest, and it could be a good time for you to reflect on the past year and what 911 has meant to us as a state.

We continue to pray for you as a family.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do to help you.   Regards,  Bob

Subject:	Osceola County Schools Financial Appropriations

Dear Governor Bush;

I manage a beverage manufacturing facility located in Osceola County and as
a corporate citizen of the county our company supports the State Legislature
approved moneys of $10 million to support school systems in Florida's
fastest growing counties and trust that you will seek ways to help make this
happen.  

Our plant employs a large percentage of people who reside in Osceola County
and many of these folks have school age children who will benefit from these
appropriations today and in their future school years.  In addition, we rely
heavily on the local population base to draw upon for future employment
needs as we hope to grow our business in the near future.  Having young
adults come out of local schools well prepared for the work environment for
today and for tomorrow not only benefits our business but also benefits the
economy of Osceola County as well as the State of Florida.

I appreciate the opportunity to be able to share this message with you and
trust that these moneys will made available to those counties experiencing
rapid growth so that our young people coming out of school will be well
prepared to step in and carry on the economic development of Central
Florida.



Sincerely,

Roger W. Dickey, Plant Manager
Quaker Foods and Beverages Kissimmee Plant

Dear Jeb:

On behalf of Mote and other cultural organizations in the state, we urge
you to support funding for the Cultural Facilities Program for
FY2002-03.

Cultural facilities grants are competitive, peer-reviewed and require
matching funds as a pre-requisite.  100% of the funds are passed
directly into the local economy where they promote job creation and
enhance tourism.

Mote's $500,000 request for cultural facilities grant was rated number
one in the state and we have already raised substantial matching funds.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kumar

Jeb: We have recieved word from the Division of Cultural Affairs at Dept. of State that you are that 
you are contemplating a veto of the Cultural Facilities Program. We have already called your staff and voiced our concern, but this is to you personally.
 
Please reconsider. We have two projects in rural Highlands County on that funding list. Both non profit organizations have a major impact on our quality of life and the economy. The Theatre Project in Lake Placid will mount an outdoor production depicting Florida history and the Highlands Little Theatre Project will allow for stabilization of their building and expansion of their facilities, allowing them to serve our expanding population. This is the only program available to provide this assistance. Highlands County is an underserved area and needs the help the Dept of State makes available through the Cultural Facilities program.
 
We understand the difficult decisions that you must make each year with the adoption of a budget. Especially this year. But this program creates construction jobs and improves our quality of life factors. These programs also provide educational opportunities in the arts for our youth, an area that is always the first to go during tight fiscal years. The cultural organizations throughout the state are picking up the slack in that area from School Boards.
 
Thanks for your time and consideration.

We will bring a budget package to the mansion shortly. 

It will include: 

o All code changes we have made since we met with you. They are clearly marked so you can see what we did and fix them if I was wrong.

o A new "M" list 

o A new list of all projects, reflecting recent code changes 

o Queeb lists, marked with codes 

o New totals and new WCF balance 

o Member appeals. These codes have not been changed, and are not reflected on any of the above. There are only a handful, based on committee review this afternoon (Hayden, Alan, Greg, and I went through each member and reviewed what they have and what they asked for).

It was nice to have you in Orange County to sigh The Growth Management Bill. Water, as you said, will be a big part of future growth management.  Our award winning Project ARROW (Apopka Regional Reuse Of Water) has been in operation for over a decade. Soon we hope to take reuse water from other  wastewater plants for home irrigation through our distribution system. The goal is to use 100% of reuse water available so that none is wasted.
Thanks for your leadership.

Subject:	Film and television incentives

Dear Governor Bush:

As President of the Orlando Chapter of the Florida Motion Picture and 
Television Association (FMPTA) I have written to you and various members of 
the legislature on at least two other occasions to express our collective 
opinion regarding what the State of Florida is doing to help keep what is 
left of our Florida film and television industry from vanishing completely.  
Now I feel I must do so again.

The following article tells me that the Governor of California is a genuine 
supporter of his state's entertainment industry.  The California Legislature 
seems to be backing him up with an incentives bill that will help level the 
playing field between that State and foreign countries, such as Canada, who 
are avidly luring away American film production through government subsidies 
and incentives that make it far more economical to film there, even with all 
the snow and cold weather.  

The Directors' Guild of America (DGA) just modified their list of designated 
Production Centers, and Florida is glaringly absent from this list.  However, 
two cities in Canada are on it.  Apparently, there's not enough production 
going on here (outside of commercials and videos, which were not counted in 
the  DGA's calculations) to warrant such a designation.  For an industry that 
is reported to bring some 3.9 billion dollars into Florida businesses every 
year, we don't seem to be making much of an impression!

California is getting organized to fight this "runaway production."  But we 
in Florida cannot rely on the West Coast to fight our battle for us -- after 
all, as far as they  are concerned, Florida is part of the problem.  We're 
another example of runaway production, and as soon as they've won the battle 
against Canada, they'll be coming after us -- provided, of course, that we're 
still here.  

Florida has to save itself, and we need our political leaders behind us.  
Next session, the Legislature needs to take up the incentives bills again -- 
and if there are any adjustments to be made in the overall funding, they need 
to be made in an upward direction.  We're not trying to get fat off the 
public trough; we're just trying to survive in an environment rife with 
unfair subsidies and uncaring accountants.  

You have said time and again that you support our film and television 
industry.  Then why do we continue to see State offices hiring out-of-state 
production companies to produce documentaries and commercials, funded by our 
taxes, when there are plenty of qualified production houses here in the State 
of Florida?  It's time the leadership of the State got behind this industry, 
to which it owes so very much, and stopped acting as if it doesn't exist.  If 
you're ignoring this industry in hopes that it will go away, believe me, it 
will -- and so will all the jobs and income (and taxes!) that it brings to 
the State.

If California can rally to save itself, why can't Florida?

Sincerely,

Mike Conrad
President
Orlando/Central Florida Chapter, FMPTA

Calif. law to aid film production gets major boost

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California lawmakers Wednesday gave a boost to a law 
meant to curb the number of film and television producers heading out of 
state for work and taking millions of dollars in spending power with them.

With only one dissenting vote, the California State Assembly passed a bill 
that provides for a 15 percent tax credit on the first $250,000 of qualifying 
wages for all movies and TV programs with budgets between $200,000 and $10 
million.

The measure must still be approved by the state Senate and signed by Gov. 
Gray Davis, who has proposed his own tax incentive plan to keep film and TV 
production in the state. If enacted, the law could take effect as soon as 
January 1, 2004.

The bill is aimed at stemming the tide of so-called "runaway" film and TV 
production to states outside of California and countries outside the United 
States.

The California bill closely mirrors two federal proposals in the U.S. Senate 
and House of Representatives. It is aimed at movies and TV shows with low- to 
mid-level budgets made mostly by independent producers who then sell those 
programs to the major TV networks and Hollywood studios for distribution.

Those producers can shave 20 percent to 30 percent or more from the cost of 
programs through tax incentives given by countries such as Canada, which is 
getting the lion's share of runaway film and TV production.

"Wage-based tax incentives allow California to remain competitive when vying 
with other states and countries for production," said Joseph Aredas, 
chairperson of the California Coalition for Entertainment Jobs, a group 
supporting the bill.

A study issued last December by the Los Angeles-based Center for 
Entertainment Industry Data and Research showed that in 2000 the number of 
films with budgets between $5 million and $50 million made in Canada rose to 
31 from 16 in 1999.

The overall economic impact from runaway production was some $1.8 billion in 
business revenues and 22,400 jobs lost.

Those figures were for movies only.

A separate report issued by the U.S. Dept. of Commerce in 2001 showed that 
film and TV runaway production cost the U.S. economy $10 billion a year.

GOVERNOR BUSH,
 
ADAM WAS ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL TUESDAY BECAUSE OF A LUMP (THOUGHT TO BE AN INFECTION OF A LYMPH NODE) BUT A CAT SCAN SHOWS THAT THERE IS A "MASS .  AS YOU CAN IMAGINE........... I AM SCARED AND HAVE BEEN AT THE HOSPITAL BY ADAMS SIDE 24/7 SINCE TUESDAY.  TODAY, I CAME HOME TO DEAL WITH THIS CRAP THAT DISTRICT 14  IS CONTINUING TO  PUT ME THROUGH. THIS LETTER TO YOU IS MY LAST EFFORT.  IF YOU CAN OR WILL NOT  DO SOMETHING, PERSONALLY, (BESIDES TELL SOMEONE ELSE TO DO SOMETHING WHICH HAS ALREADY NOT WORKED AS CARL LITTLEFIELD WAS NOT HELP AT ALL )   I WILL JUST HAVE TO TAKE ADAM OUT OF THE DISTRICT 14  DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES  (DCF)  DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES (DD)  PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY ARE MAKING MY LIFE A LIVING NIGHTMARE.   HE GETS NOTHING FROM THIS DEPARTMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT ANYWAY.  AS A SINGLE MOTHER OF 17 YRS OF 2 SONS, ONE WITH ADD AND ADAM BORN WITH SPINA BIFIDA (DEVELOPMENTALLY DELAYED AND PARAPLEGIC),   MY LIFE IS HARD JUST TRYING TO FOOD AND CLOTHING ON THE LESS THAN $9000.00/YR. I GET FROM THE GOVERNMENT MUCH LESS THE FACT THAT TO GET THEM A FREE AND APPROPRIATE PUBLIC EDUCATION IS NON EXISTENT. EVERY DAY IS A BATTLE AND I CAN NOT BATTLE  THIS AGENCY ANYMORE.  I AM BEGGING YOU TO TAKE ACTION TO GET THIS DISTRICTS DCF DD PROGRAM TO SETTLE THIS ISSUE.   EVERY TIME I HEAR FROM THEM,  THEY CHANGE THEIR STORY AS TO ADAMS CASE.   NOTHING WILL PROCEED FOR ADAM UNTIL THIS IS SETTLED AND THEY REFUSE TO GIVE MONIES BACK TO ME THAT ARE DUE ME BY A VOTE OF OUR FAMILY CARE COUNCIL (FCC).
 
FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW THE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES  (DD) PROGRAM (ERIC OLSEN) HAS FOUGHT BACK AND FORTH WITH ME ABOUT $1631. THAT BACK IN 1999 ADAMS CASE WORKER SENT TO ME BECAUSE I WAS ON ABC VOUCHERING.  THE MONEY WAS SENT TO GO TOWARD MAKING ADAMS BATHROOM WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE. (COST WILL BE $5000.00 OR MORE TOTAL)   THE DISTRICT WAS REQUIRED TO OBTAIN MORE THAN ONE BID AND WHEN I GAVE THAT PAPERWORK FROM A MAN WHO WORKED AT HOME DEPOT  TO LINDA COLKITT, ADAMS CASE WORKER AT THE TIME,  I TOLD HER TO JUST HOLD ON TO IT BECAUSE THE MAN WAS GOING TO USE HIS 13 YR. OLD SON TO HELP HIM AND I WANTED TO CHECK TO SEE IF THIS MAN HAD A CONTRACTORS LICENSE.  TEN DAYS LATER A CHECK FOR THE $1631. ARRIVED JUST AS ALL MY OTHER ABC VOUCHER MONIES HAD ARRIVED.  
 
IN A MEETING TO SIGN ADAM ONTO MED WAIVER IN MAY. 2000, WITH MARK YOUNG , THE DISTRICT 14 DD PROGRAM MANAGER (WHO WAS ACTING AS ADAMS SUPPORT COORDINATOR (SC) AT THE TIME.... HE QUIT DCF DD IN DECEMBER 2001) I REMINDED MARK THAT I HAD TO PAY VIA CREDIT CARD THAT $1631. TOWARD THE TOTAL COST WHEN THE BATHROOM WAS REMODELED.   WHEN ADAM GOT ROBIN NASON AS A SC IN  OCT. 2000 AND SHE CAME TO UPDATE ADAMS HAB PLAN,   I AGAIN REMINDED HER THAT I WOULD NEED TO PAY $1631.  TOWARD THE  BATHROOM WHEN THE DISTRICT ACTUALLY DID THE REMODELING.  I REPEATEDLY BEGGED ERIC TO SETTLE THIS MATTER BY LETTING ME PAY THE MONEY WHEN THE WORK WAS DONE AS I HAVE NO WAY TO GET $1631. CASH TO HAND TO THE DISTRICT.  HE HAS REFUSED AND AT A MEETING AT THE DISTRICT OFFICE ON MARCH 29, 2001, IN WHICH ROBIN NASON WAS FIRED FOR INCOMPETENCE,  LINDA BROPHY STATED TO ME,   "ALL OF ADAMS SERVICES WILL HAVE TO BE DISCONTINUED UNTIL YOU PAY US BACK THE MONEY"  NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I CALLED GARRETTS,  THE MEDICAL SUPPLY STORE (FROM MARCH 2001 UNTIL APRIL 2002 ...EXCEPT FOR JAN. 2002 WHEN MARK HAD QUIT AND SOMEONE APPROVED ONE MONTH) THAT WAS CONTRACTED TO SEND ADAMS SUPPLIES, APPROVAL WAS NEVER GRANTED. NOTHING ON ADAMS  HAB PLAN OR APPROVED ON HIS COST PLAN WAS IMPLEMENTED DURING THAT TIME.  LINDA BROPHY TOLD ME TO SEND RECEIPTS FOR THE MONEY AND I DID. IN A LETTER DEC. 2001, MARK YOUNG TOLD ME THE RECEIPTS WERE "UNACCEPTABLE'.  ERIC TOLD ME TO "SEND RECEIPTS FOR WORK DONE" SO I CALLED, FRANK MURILLO OF PRO-TEX CONTRACTING,  THE CONTRACTOR THAT ROBIN NASON HAD HAD COME OUT AND SUBMIT A BID IN MAY OF 2000.  HE CAME HERE ON APRIL 3, 2002 AND THE FOLLOWING OCCURRED:
 
    1.  THAT WEDNESDAY, HE AND 2 EMPLOYEES LOOKED AT THE BATHROOM & ASK  ME WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE AND I TOLD HIM AND TOLD HIM I ONLY HAD $1631. TO DO THE  WORK ( A DOORWAY FROM ADAMS ROOM TO THE BATHROOM, A SINK WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE AND AN EXHAUST FAN) AND I ASK FRANK WOULD THAT BE ENOUGH AND HE STATED"FOR YOU I WILL DO IT FOR THAT".
 
    2.  HE HAD ME MEET HIM AT HOME DEPOT AND HE FILLED A CART WITH SUPPLIES.  I TOLD HIM AT THE STORE THAT THE SINK HE BOUGHT WAS WRONG AND THAT THE DOOR HE WANTED ME TO PURCHASE WOULD NOT WORK.  HE MADE ME BUY IT ANYWAY. (THE DOOR,  SINK, FACET, AND EXHAUST FAN HAD TO BE TAKEN BACK BY ME THE NEXT DAY AND EXCHANGED .... WHICH COST ME $90.00 MORE.) THE SUPPLIES THAT DAY WERE CHARGED TO MY CREDIT CARD.  FRANK MURILLO LEFT ME THERE IN LINE TO PAY.
 
   3.  APRIL 3RD,  FRANK MET ME BACK AT MY HOME AND I GAVE HIM THE PAPERWORK FROM HOME DEPOT FOR THE SUPPLIES AND HE LOOKED AT THE PAPERWORK AND ON THE INSIDE OF HIS FOLDER,  DID THE MATH TO TAKE THAT AMOUNT OFF OF THE $1631. WHICH LEFT $1307. WHICH FRANK PROCEEDED TO TELL ME THAT HE REQUIRED AT LEAST 1/2 OF THE TOTAL THAT DAY AS A DEPOSIT.  HE TOOK MY CREDIT CARD AND CALLED HIS OFFICE AND CHARGED THE $1307. TO MY CREDIT CARD.  I TOLD HIM I WOULD TRUST HIM SINCE HE WAS PAID IN FULL INSTEAD OF JUST 1/2 AS A DEPOSIT. 
 
  4.  HIS EMPLOYEE SHOWED UP AT MY HOME THE NEXT DAY, THURSDAY, REEKING OF BOOZE AND I CALLED FRANK RIGHT AWAY.  AN HOUR LATER,  FRANK CAME AND TOLD ME "IF YOU WANT ANY WORK DONE, THEN THIS MAN IS THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN WORK TODAY OR YOU GET NO WORK DONE". HE TOLD ME THAT THE EMPLOYEE, MIKE, HAD TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD BEEN TO A PARTY AND DRINKING UNTIL 3:00 AM BUT HAD NOT BEEN DRINKING THAT MORNING.  I HAVE ENOUGH EXPERIENCE TO SAY THAT THIS MAN APPEARED TO BE UNDER THE INFLUENCE AN I TOLD FRANK THAT I DID NOT WANT MIKE TO RUN ELECTRICAL WIRING IN MY HOME THAT DAY.  FRANK TOLD MIKE NOT TO DO ANY ELECTRICAL WORK AND TOLD ME THAT CLAY WOULD COME AND DO THE ELECTRICAL WIRING THE NEXT DAY.  WHEN CLAY WAS NOT HERE BY 10:00AM,  I CALLED FRANK AND HE INFORMED ME THAT NO ONE COULD COME THAT DAY WHICH WOULD LEAVE NO AVAILABLE SINK ALL WEEKEND FOR THE BOYS.  I REMINDED FRANK THAT MIKE HAD NOT DONE MUCH WORK THURSDAY AND HE TOLD ME THAT I SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAVE LET MIKE IN THAT THURSDAY AND IT WAS MY FAULT.  HE THEN TOLD ME AGAIN NO ONE COULD COME THAT DAY.   HE TOLD ME TO GET SOME ONE ELSE TO FINISH THE JOB.  I TOLD HIM THAT HIS MAN HAD CUT THE DOORWAY 38 1/2" INSTEAD OF 36" AND THAT HIS MEN WOULD HAVE TO FIX THE MESS.  FRANKS MAN PUT 2X4S UNDER THE SINK TO HOLD IT UP AND I COMPLAINED SO THERON MADE SOME CABINETS WHICH WERE HORRIBLE (SIZE REQUIRED THAT THE SINK JUST SAT ON  THE SIDES OF THE  CABINET,  THE SINK COULD NOT BE CENTERED, AND THE COLOR WAS NOT AT ALL COMPATIBLE TO ANY WOOD IN OUR HOME MUCH LESS THE WOOD MIRROR CABINET ABOVE THE  SINK.   ON MAY 1ST, FRANK FINALLY HAD THERON JUST PURCHASE THE SINK STAND THAT I HAD TOLD FRANK AT HOME DEPOT ON APRIL 3RD, THAT I WANTED AND HE HAD REFUSED.  I KNOW NOW THAT FRANK BOUGHT JUST THE MINIMUM SUPPLIES AND CHEAPEST SUPPLIES IN  ORDER TO INCREASE THE LABOR MONEY HE WOULD GET.
 
  4.  MAY 2, 2002  HIS MAN, THERON, FINISHED INSTALLING THE STAND AND SINK AND LEFT STATING THAT HE WAS FINISHED AND NOT GOING TO RETURN.   
 
THE WORK IS AWFUL.   ANOTHER CONTRACTOR IS  TO BE HERE  TOMORROW MORNING CONTACTED BY ADAMS NEW SC  TO FINISH TO MAKE THE BATHROOM WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE .....   (I AM GOING TO CALL AND CANCEL THIS APPOINTMENT AS I WILL NOT LEAVE ADAM ALONE AT THE HOSPITAL AGAIN WHEN IT IS OBVIOUS TO ME THAT THIS DISTRICT DD DOES NOT INTEND TO SETTLE THE MATTER OF THE $1631. NO MATTER WHAT I DO AND DO NOT INTEND TO  PAY FOR WORK TO PROCEED TO FIX THIS BATHROOM AND PUT IN A ROLL IN SHOWER FOR ADAM TO BE INDEPENDENT NOR INTEND TO REIMBURSE ME THE MONIES FROM THE FND CONFERENCE)..... THIS NEW CONTRACTOR TOLD ME HE HAS PICTURES OF FRANKS PRIOR JOBS THAT  HE USES FOR STATE WORKSHOPS THAT SHOW WHAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN YOU USE THE WRONG CONTRACTOR. HE TOLD ME TO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING AND HE WILL TAKE OF GETTING THE BATHROOM DONE RIGHT FOR ADAM TO USE. DD IS SUPPOSE TO COVER THE COST OF THIS.
 
  5.  FRANK MURILLO WENT UP IN FRONT OF THE CONTRACTOR LICENSING BOARD ON MAY 9TH.  HE DID NOT COME BUT HIS LAWYER GOT THE CHARGES DROPPED BECAUSE THE MAN WHO FILED THE CHARGES TOLD ME THAT FRANK PAID HIM OFF WITH $3000.00.  FRANK MURILLO  HAS HAD HIS CONTRACTORS LICENSE TAKEN FROM HIM BEFORE THIS AND NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW HOW HE GOT ANOTHER LICENSE  TO MAKE MONEY (HIS LICENSE IS UNDER HIS SONS NAME AS I UNDERSTAND IT NOW).... ANYWAY, I TELL YOU ALL THIS TO MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND HOW THIS DISTRICT 14 DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES (DCF) DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES PROGRAM TREATS THEIR CLIENTS AND THE FAMILIES WHO LOVE THEM AND CARE FOR THEM...... THIS MAN NOW HAS TOLD DD LIES BY STATING THAT HE NEVER SAW THE PAPERWORK FROM HOME DEPOT TO DEDUCT THE COST OF  SUPPLIES FROM THE $1631. TO GET THE $1307. THAT HE CHARGED ON MY CARD AND HE STATES THAT HE RETURNED $200.00 TO ME WHICH HE DID NOT AND NOW THE DCF DD PROGRAM ON TOP OF THE $1700. I HAVE ALREADY INCURRED ON MY CREDIT CARD FOR THIS WORK, DEMANDS THAT I GIVE THEM $200.00...... WHY WOULD DISTRICT 14 DD PEOPLE CALL ME A LIAR BECAUSE I WROTE BACK TO BRENDA BRYAN WHEN SHE WROTE TO ASK  THE DETAILS AND I EXPLAINED TO HER EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE TOLD YOU....

Subject:	New landfill technology getting recognition the world over!

Importance:	High

Enstech Inc.
Environmental Services and Technologies
 
Friday, May 31, 2002
 
          Our Enstech system of landfill maintenance has continued to receive widespread acclaim from everyone from the steel industry to environmental newspapers in Europe. We are looking to receive even more coverage, however. The latest article describing our technology is on edie.net:
 
 <http://www.edie.net/news/Archive/5579.cfm> http://www.edie.net/news/Archive/5579.cfm
 
          We have also been asked to co-chair the Environmental Innovations Summit 2002 ( <http://www.performanceweb.org/EIS2002.html>  http://www.performanceweb.org/EIS2002.html), where people such as Christine Whitman, Senators Tauzan and Abraham, and other government and waste management officials will be on hand. This will be sometime in September.
Also attached at the bottom is a letter we recently sent to the EPA. This letter, and also our website at www.enstechinc.com <http://www.enstechinc.com/> , describe our leak detection and repair technology for landfills in detail. Please visit our site, read the letters and the article, and feel free to email me or contact me by phone about this.

RE: New generations of safe landfill containments that can pinpoint the liner leaks, contain the escaping leachate, and repair the leaks, allowing landfills for the first time in history to be able to be maintained.
 
Dear Sir or Madam,
 
In the 10 years of the R.C.R.A. rules becoming law, every aspect of the way this nation and industry addresses its waste has dramatically improved to better protect our environment, except for landfill containments. The same basic landfill design and technology used 10 years ago is still used today, and all past and present day landfills contain a serious flaw. 
The current landfill designs and systems lack the ability to monitor their barrier liners. The lack of ability to accurately monitor their lining systems prevents today’s lining systems from being maintained. Any science or technology that does not have the ability to accurately evaluate it’s own integrity in regards to its intended purpose and usage by using reliable checks and balances, is flawed and incomplete. The current need for improved landfill science and technology becomes apparent when it is estimated that out of all of the disposal methods used today, 47% of all waste generated goes into landfill containments.
After 10 years of research and development, there is a new science and technology that will allow all new landfills, containments, and their liners to be maintained. I have created a web presentation of the ENSTECH system, showing how the system works in a typical landfill application, on www.enstechinc.com <http://www.enstechinc.com/>  . The web presentation will show how the ENSTECH system will work in pinpointing the leaks, and then contain and repair the leaks in municipal, industrial, hazardous, and cold radioactive landfills. It must be understood that until the ENSTECH system’s development, no previous containment technology has had the ability to accurately find, contain and repair any leaks.
Not shown in this web presentation is the Enstech high heat resistant metal lining system. For an example of the liner module made of heat resistant metal, refer to the diagram at  <http://www.enstechinc.com/diagram.jpg> http://www.enstechinc.com/diagram.jpg . As you watch the web presentation, in your mind, replace all the plastic lining and piping with nuclear grade stainless steel or titanium. This containment system can be used under heat generating sources in industrial manufacture, such as hot caustic or cooling tanks. The same system can be employed under heat generating nuclear material and waste, such as radioactive water, sludges, and solids including used nuclear fuel rods. By using this simple design change, the public and government alike can be assured that no radioactive waste or material has escaped from the containment. The same critical assurance can be made that no out-of-containment water will leak back into the containment. With the development of the Enstech high-heat lining system comes the ability to safely contain and monitor hot waste and materials.
I have sent this same letter to Administrator Whitman, asking for her help in establishing this new containment system as Best Available Control Technology (BACT). I have also asked for her help with all E.P.A. programs and awards that will apply in bringing this technology to this nation. I hope to gain written permission to use the E.P.A. logo endorsement that has been given to other such technologies.
Please review the presentation and write me back with your thoughts and suggestions regarding this new technology. I look forward to your response regarding this matter. 
 
 
 
 
 
Thank you,

Hello.  I am just your average, tax-paying citizen who also happens to be a graduate sutdent and social worker.  I am really concerned with a lot of things that have been going on recently with DCF, the cutting  of funding for group homes for children, etc.  We always hear the negative about DCF.  I have read your Blue Ribbon Panel's suggestions.  Not bad.  However, unless adequate funding is diverted to social services (and not just DCF), things like this will continue to happen.  I worked at DCF in District 13 during the Kayla McKean disaster.  I am still involved with the child protection system in a different capacity, with a different agency.  I have worked the front lines, behind the scenes, etc.  Lack of funding, lack of ways to  encourage retention of employees (i.e.m - cutting tuition waivers for sate employees to better themselves and further their professional development and enhance their skills), lack of professionalization of the agency as a whole (requiring social service professional instead of anybody (Any Body) to fill a vacant position, these are just a few of the issues that plague DCF and other agencies.  Even with adequate funding for a long-term period (with no cuts) it would take several years or more to rejuvenate and revamp the child welfare system in Florida.  Just as there are incompetent people without ethical and moral consciences, there are just as many and many more caring, devoted, hard-working men and women that believe in our children and their right to be protected and nurtured.  They certainly don't work for the state of Florida for the wages, job incentives, etc.  We need to prioritize our budget and figure out what is important.  Where are all of the children going to go when funds for residential treatment are cut?  Back home?  In the community?  Into DJJ facilities?  Into the already beleaguered foster care system?  There are so many issues that I could go on and on, however I won't.  Just wanted to drop a line and say my small piece.  Thank you for your time.

Prior to my going to Tara for a possible date, are you interested in doing
an interview pre-UK trade mission with London Financial Times per request of
Enterprise Florida?  Another will be held during UK mission. I believe them
to be good ones.

1)  Request for 1/2 hour pre-mission (in Tally or by phone) interview on UK
mission w/ Foreign Direct Investment section of London Financial Times.
With it comes a series of benefits in the magazine to include a 6 page
Florida spread. 

2)  Request for interview in UK during mission with London Financial Times.
This is already built into your schedule.

Katie and Lisa are neutral on these since it is international media.  Your
call.

Confidential records sold at DCF auction

Thousands and thousands of confidential files left in an abandoned
building
where the public was invited in for an auction. A reporter from 10 News
was
able to purchase boxes containing some of these records that the public
should never have been allowed to see. The incident shows apparent gross
negligence by the Department of Children and Families

 
56k Modem | High-Speed
 
 
The auction was held Thursday at the W.T. Edwards Building that housed
local
DCF offices for several years. When the agency vacated the building, the
records were left behind.

All over the building were signs that said "shred all", as well as
printed
on the boxes. Obviously, the contents were never shredded. Anyone who
registered for the auction could have bought these boxes.

The problem is that confidentiality is the cornerstone of child
protection.
Workers are told they are never supposed to break confidentiality. When
district headquarters abandoned their old building to move. The agency
seemed to forget that rule.

When the Department of Children and Families was questioned about the
records, a spokesman said it was not their fault, but the auctioneer who
made the mistake of selling them is responsible.

Auctioneer Tom Hicks says people from the department walked through the
building several times. They were completely aware of what was being
sold.
They opened the doors to the offices. When he asked prior to the auction
if
there was anything they didn't want him to sell, they asked for the
building
blueprints 

DCF says it is firing the auctioneer because he shouldn't have sold the
files, and they are halting the auction. The auctioneer says he has a
contract for what's called an absolute auction, which means everything
in
the building is sold.

Governor Jeb Bush says he's angry and upset that the Department of
Children
and Family services allowed thousands of confidential records to be put
up
for public auction.

He thanked 10 News for bringing it to his attention and asked if he
could
take possession of the records.

10 News turned them over to him and he says the other records we bought
will
be shredded Monday. He says DCF needs to take responsibility for the
mistake.

Governor Bush,

I understand that you received a copy of flyer protesting the Durable
Medical Equipment (DME) Competitive billing process and an attached letter
expressing concerns signed by Dolores (Lolly) Gonzalez. The flyer includes a
picture of Dolores with her 20 year old medically complex son, Oscar
Gonzalez. We tried to contact Oscar and his family to offer assistance with
DME needs, but both very politely refused to discuss any issues relating to
DME. It turns out that Oscar is one of witnesses for the plaintiff who has
filed a protest against the Agency for issuing the DME request for
proposals. The family has been advised by legal counsel not to discuss any
issues relating to DME. In the meantime, we reviewed Oscar's current
services and provider claims to ensure that his health care needs are fully
addressed.

> Oscar is currently receiving 24 hour skilled nursing care due to multiple
> chronic conditions.  Our notes indicate that he suffers from
> Werdnig-Hoffman disease, has a tracheostomy, is ventilator dependent,
> requires the use of a customized wheelchair, and appears to have some type
> of colostomy problems.
> 
> His Medicaid-funded DME and supplies include a Bear-33 ventilator, O2
> stationary and portable, suction machine stationary and portable,

> catheters, and gloves.  The customized wheelchair was paid by Medicaid in
> 1998.  Within the next year, he will be aging out of the Children's
> Medical Services system and transition planning is underway.
> 
According to provider DME Medicaid claims for Oscar, the provider the family
uses is called Pedi-Stat.  All of Pedi-Stat's claims have already been paid.
We do not have any record of pending requests or claims on Oscar's behalf at
this time. If Oscar's needs change, we will continue to provide assistance
necessary to ensure access to quality health care.

While AHCA appreciates the concern of DME providers, families and
recipients, particularly on the needs of children, the services procured
under the RFP will continue to be of the same or higher quality then
provided under the existing system.  Additionally, as all proposers are
existing Medicaid providers, and AHCA is going to confirm that none of them
have had fraud or abuse issues. The contractors will be providers who have
proven reliability in delivering high quality goods and timely services to
the medically needy population.  

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you need additional information or
assistance on this situation.

Sincerely,

Shelly Brantley
Chief, Health Systems Development
Agency for Health Care Administration

Update as of 6pm today.

Good news for students!

The current enrollment (participation #)
of students in McKay for this year
(2001-2002) was 5000.

As of today, we have 5114 students
indicating they will be participating
in the program for coming year 2002-2003.

We have exceed current 
enrollment figures, and we are one
month early (first qtr deadline is
July 1, with 3 other chances during
rest of the year...)

This is good indication that parents:
A.  Want choice
B.  Are opting for this program
C.  Are pleased and remaining with
the program.

We have 300% increase from
year 1 in private schools participating.

400% increase in student participation
from year 1.

School Yr. 2002-2003 is year 3.

Other info...

We received 525 calls from parents
yesterday.

Approximately 250 calls today.

We are averaging a daily
call rate of 230 calls, and the
letters sent to potentially eligible
students (300,000) are just now
arriving in homes.

The calls may indicate (then)  
that information
is getting to parents and they are 
responding with interest, even if they
have not yet received letter.

Subject: nursing shortage


Jeb, 
Thanks for taking the time to meet with us on Tuesday about the nursing shortage. It was a pleasure to meet you. I have been thinking about it a lot and came up with an idea that I would like you to consider. Being a pediatric nurse practitioner I think a lot about the health and well-being of the children of this state. I do believe that having school nurses makes a huge difference in the health maintenance of school-aged children, but that is not all that they do. They are also a great role-model for the children. We talked about having nurses go to schools to talk up nursing as a profession. Why not assign school nurses to every school and have them also present nursing as a profession to the students via the classroom and by example? I think that this would be a great way to promote nursing from a very young age. What do you think? I'd be happy to help in any way that I can to see that this gets presented as an option. 
Also, I would like to invite you to my place of work and play, the Boggy Creek Gang Camp. The camp is for kids with chronic and life-threatening illnesses and we operate year round. You should come and check it out sometime and see what nurses love to do with their volunteer hours. 
Thank you for your time, 
Kerry Mullen, CPNP, ACRN
Nursing Director, Boggy Creek Gang Camp

Subject:	Cultural and Historic Importance.

Governor Bush,
Perhaps a monster was created when the system of sending  money to Tallahassee for redistribution back to the source of the money (local communities) was created. But that is the system we have and we have to make it work!
 
If local communities get short changed on the return of money for important projects, then the system won't last.
 
Of primary importance to local communities - especially historic communities dependent on tourism - is the ability to maintain, support and enhance our cultural and historic heritage. For St. Augustine, it would be the kiss of death to starve these important aspects of our community. Without history and meaning historic interpretations, St. Augustine is nothing. 
 
I urge you to sign the legislation on your desk for Preservation and Cultural Monies allocation. Those funds are important for all of us.

Subject: DCF Problems


Gov Bush 

It would appear that at DCF government knows best!  I received a disturbing call today from some assisted living facility administrators in the suncoast region, they said they left a meeting with DCF staff and were told that the people in charge at mental health in Tallahassee had issued an "order" to remove all the mental health consumers that are enrolled in the Florida Assertive Community Treatment (FACT)Program from licensed limited mental health assisted living facilities. 

I have asked DCF for a policy clarification on the utilization of licensed limited mental health assisted living facilities.  I just think it is not the place of government to spend so much time trying to determine or channel where people should live or not live.  Why not allow the market place to determine the most appropriate setting where people should live.  I believe that government should just step out of the way and let consumers, their families and case managers select the housing setting that suits their needs.  In stead government and the FACT teams are referring people to the housing settings that they believe are in their best interest. I think government should simply the whole thing and just make available to consumers what the options are and then step out of the way, this would allow the free markets to do their thing without being manipulated by DCF. 

In Jacksonville I received a call from a concerned social worker wanting to know why the local FACT team was sending everyone to a boarding home licensed under the divsion of hotels and rest   ( ie Honey Babes) instead of a licensed ALF?  I could not answer the social worker's question, Honey Babes does not offer any protections under a bill of rights and these facilities are often considered undesireable for consumers.  I suspect it has to do with the fact that placements at Honey Babes are less expensive than placement in a licensed ALF. 

In addition to active governmental interference with the marketplace I am not sure that the people currently running the adult mental health system have any understanding that they cannot discriminate against thousands of small and minority business owner because they hold a bias against ALF care.  There is no systemic data or other information that indicates a widespread breakdown in the ability of licensed limited mental health assisted living facilities ability to care for their residents. Licensed limited mental health ALFs are a great enconomic deal for the consumer and taxpayer the current rate of $27/ day is perhaps one of the most cost effective housing alternatives available to consumers and the taxpayers. 

I know you appreciate the value of open market competition and the liberty that comes along with our free enterprise system of commerce.  The situation at DCF has become so problematic it really requires someone with clear sense of direction to stop the nonsense.  Thank for taking a look and helping the DCF find its way.

Dear Governor,
It was so nice to talk with you last night at the Melbourne event. Jim is sorry to be out of town.

I was ecstatic to hear about the deal you made on the off-shore drilling, and to hear you say that Republicans care about the environment, some of our local folk need to be reminded of that! Thank you for your support of the land preservation funds, you are right, it sets a bad precedent and will further erode the trust of the voters.

I promised to let you know which Cultural Affairs item not to cut, this is a problem with caring, involved people, we have too many issues! We have a proposal in Cultural Facilities for $250,000 for a match for an Eckerd Family grant of $500,000 for an Educational Complex at the Brevard Zoo, or East Coast Zoological Society.

The short story of the proposal is that we are building three classrooms at the zoo for a "Zoo School" which will allow us to house the 5th graders at three low performing schools. We have had one working at the zoo for 5 years and the results are outstanding. We have tracked the progress of the students and they have significantly improved gradesand test scores. Behavior is better and attendance is up. This has become a national model for "at risk" kids. As you know, this is the emphasis of the Eckerd programs, and we feel that this school has shown as you said, all kids can learn and should have the opportunity to succeed.
This is really the short version and we would be glad to give you more information or provide a tour. I understand that you are in a very tough position and appreciate all that you are able to do.
Thank you,
Jonnie Swann

Adoptions have increased dramatically. The kids in foster care are down since we are getting them in permanent homes a lot quicker. Case loads are down. We are making progress because of the reforms we have made (there is much more to do!) and the dramatic increase in funding.

Hello.  I am just your average, tax-paying citizen who also happens to be a graduate sutdent and social worker.  I am really concerned with a lot of things that have been going on recently with DCF, the cutting  of funding for group homes for children, etc.  We always hear the negative about DCF.  I have read your Blue Ribbon Panel's suggestions.  Not bad.  However, unless adequate funding is diverted to social services (and not just DCF), things like this will continue to happen.  I worked at DCF in District 13 during the Kayla McKean disaster.  I am still involved with the child protection system in a different capacity, with a different agency.  I have worked the front lines, behind the scenes, etc.  Lack of funding, lack of ways to  encourage retention of employees (i.e.m - cutting tuition waivers for sate employees to better themselves and further their professional development and enhance their skills), lack of professionalization of the agency as a whole (requiring social service professional instead of anybody (Any Body) to fill a vacant position, these are just a few of the issues that plague DCF and other agencies.  Even with adequate funding for a long-term period (with no cuts) it would take several years or more to rejuvenate and revamp the child welfare system in Florida.  Just as there are incompetent people without ethical and moral consciences, there are just as many and many more caring, devoted, hard-working men and women that believe in our children and their right to be protected and nurtured.  They certainly don't work for the state of Florida for the wages, job incentives, etc.  We need to prioritize our budget and figure out what is important.  Where are all of the children going to go when funds for residential treatment are cut?  Back home?  In the community?  Into DJJ facilities?  Into the already beleaguered foster care system?  There are so many issues that I could go on and on, however I won't.  Just wanted to drop a line and say my small piece.  Thank you for your time.

Dear Governor Bush,

Last year, my family and I moved to Florida for a better quality of
life. I
met my wife in Orlando when I was stationed at McCoy AFB in 1962. The
USAF
transferred us to other states during the Vietnam War and my 23 year
enlisted service.   We returned to Florida in 2001 after being gone for
38
years, 23 of those years in the USAF, 3 years attending college in New
Mexico, and 12 years of employment with MCI in California.  In October
of
2000 Florida Power and Light  offered me a management position working
in
their new start up company, FPL FiberNet with an office in West Palm
Beach.

My wife and son arrived at West Palm Beach in May of 2001.  Since June
of
2001 we have been working with the Department Of Children and Families.
For
the past 10 months we have been trying to get funding for our
34-year-old
autistic son (Shannon Lee) so he can join a program to help him in
development and to help us with respite care. Shannon has no physical
impairments in mobility.  He loves to participate and be part of
programs
during the day.  Before moving here from Southern California, we spoke
with
the Department of Children and Families.  They assured us there would be
support and activities available for our son.  After our move we met
with
the department agency here in West Palm Beach.  Our son was evaluated
and
accepted as a client.  The shocking news that has since followed is hard
for us to accept.  We were told there is no funding and Shannon is on a
waiting list that may be as long as three years before he will be
funded.

I observed your speech last week about your family issues.  I was
impressed.  My wife and I also display our feelings when we talk about
our
son.  We are having a hard time seeing him sit at home every day with
nothing to do and no development program.  We are writing to you to see
if
there is anything that can be done.  Your assistance would be
appreciated.

Also, regardless of Shannon's issue, we believe you are the right person
for the job of Florida Governor.  You will have our support at the
polls.

I am writing in reference to page 416 section 28. PLEASE do not cut our budget, Mr. Bush. It seems that every year we get cheated because we are a small school district. Mr.Bush, I am not sure if you are aware that we are THE FASTEST growing school district in the state (and many more housing developments still being built) but we get the LEAST amount of funding per capita for school construction. What is wrong with this picture? I have a 9 yr old son and he had 29 students in his class last year. That is WAY too many kids for a third grade class. I strongly urge you not to cut our budget.
