Gary Sprott,
 
Thought you might be interested in a story involving State Attorney Bernie McCabe.
 
Attached is a recent appeal opinion that reverses my trespass conviction in the local Panama City Mall for seeking petition signatures for ballot access to run for Clerk of Court in Bay County.
 
Bernie McCabe’s assistant, Bruce Bartlett, prosecuted me on a special assignment by the governor.  He won a conviction against me in county court on the misdemeanor trespass charge.
 
The News Herald did a story on my conviction on 9NOV2000.  You can find the story by going to their search page at:
 
http://66.21.108.67/interconnect/index/search.asp
 
In the News Herald search box type in the following Boolean search phrase (include the quotes):
 
“mumbo jumbo” and wood
 
The Florida ACLU made my case “Case of the Month” for August 2000.  This can give you some detailed background.  It can be found at:
 
http://www.aclufl.org/caseofthemonthaug2000.html
 
The phrase “mumbo jumbo” was used by Bartlett in his closing argument to the jury in response to my attorney arguing my constitutional right to petition in a mall.  Obviously, the appellate judge, Costello, did not agree that the constitutional argument was “mumbo jumbo.”
 
Bartlett’s attitude towards constitutional rights as “mumbo jumbo” is a threat to our freedom in this state and country.  He took an oath to uphold an defend the Constitution, not belittle it.
 
This is another victory for the little peoples’ rights.
 
If you have any questions please feel free to contact me.

Honorable Governor Jeb Bush;
After reviewing all the kind things said about my son Scott in his efforts to serve our fair state on the St. Johns River Water Management Board I suddenly realized I had remained silent.  
I voted for Barry Goldwater for president and knew him to be a wonderful, kind and gentle man who was much maligned by our liberal "friends" in the media and the malicious campaign against him.  As a result of that experience I became disenchanted with politics until I was walking down the hall of our home in Ormond Beach many years later and noticed a life-sized picture of Ronald Reagan, who was campaigning for president, on Scott's bedroom door.  He and we have remained loyal Republicans ever since.  We were at your Dad's inauguration to the presidency in 1990 and my wife Dale and I attended a rally for Mr. Bill Grant in 1989 at which time we were privileged to have our photograph taken with your Dad.  He was a most gracious and charming man and both you and I are very lucky to have such wonderful Fathers.  
In 1987 I served on the Medical Committee at the inauguration of Hon. Bob Martinez and my son-in-law, Charles Parker of Georgianna Methodist Church in Merritt Island served as chaplain at recent Gubernatorial functions in the Brevard County area.
If you chose to not act favorably upon this appointment we, our whole family from Robert C. RyalsSr., 95 on Feb. 9, 2003, myself John Richard Ryals, MD, my son Scott and my son-in-law Rev. Charles Parker, will STILL support you as we support you, not for what you can do for us, but for what you can do for the state of Florida and the content of your character (apologies to Dr. King!).
I apologize for bothering you with such trivial matters in such troubling times.  I thank God every day for you and your brother being in positions of leadership at a time when our country is in such great danger.
Good luck, good health and God's speed Jeb Bush we need you!
Sincerely,
John Richard Ryals, MD

In his article "The Patience of Jeb" [Style, Feb. 23], Mark Leibovich refers to former first lady Barbara Bush's eyes as being "bugged." Obviously, Leibovich is unaware that Mrs. Bush suffers from Graves' disease, a condition that is the leading cause of hyperthyroidism. Bulging of the eyes is one of the symptoms associated with this disease.

Graves' disease is a very serious, yet treatable condition. Leibovich should not make snide references to someone's physical characteristics without having all of the facts first.

-- Lori Pleines 

•

It's a shame that Mark Leibovich was unable to put aside his apparent personal dislike for Gov. Jeb Bush. His barbs and sarcastic humor portrayed a man unfamiliar to those of us who know and admire Bush.

The personal comments about his wife were unnecessary, and the constant analysis of the inter-personal relationships between Jeb Bush and his family seemed more like Raelian psychobabble than journalism. The writer ridiculed everything, including the Bush family eyes, the governor's personal contact with constituents through e-mail and his commitment to "being a better father and husband."

There was almost no mention of his deep faith, his family-values agenda, his personal qualities and his solid achievements as governor. Perhaps your reporter was concerned that if the people knew too much about the real Jeb Bush, they might just send him to the Senate in 2006.

Dear Gov. Bush, 
I sent you an email the other day but it was to your office, so you probably haven't gotten it.  As you can see, or maybe you can't, but it is 2:30am and I can't sleep for thinking about my sister in jail for something she didn't do.  I know you will be getting more emails regarding her situation, because those who know her, know she did not do what DCF has accused her of.  They took her daughters situation, and hounded her until she told the story they wanted.  Anyway, on behalf of myself, and many others, we are asking for mercy for my sister.  She has a darling 4 year old son who is in my oldest sisters care, and he wants his mommy back.  He is smart, talented, and just a wonderful child.  My sister has done a great job with him. Her daughter has had problems since she was a young child; she is now 14.  I love my niece very much, and have let her know that, but she is lying, and has done an extremely damaging thing to her mother and to her little brother, and many others. I don't want to take up so much of your time, as I know you are a busy man.  I asked one of the priest at my church for advice, and he said to contact someone political regarding this.  I love your family, and what you stand for, and I am praying that there is something you can do about this.  My sister is not a child abuser and never has been.  If anything, she should have spanked her daughter more when she was growing up, and maybe she would be better behaved.  My kids, as well as my older sister's children were spanked and they are wonderful children. Of course they weren't spanked much because they are such good kids. My oldest sister, Gail Cain, is a neighbor of a good friend of yours, Else.  My nephews take care of her yard for free, and have for many years.  She is a dear.  My sister who is in jail is Christine Stanley, and the judge that she had was Judge Mathis who doesn't believe in spanking and he picked all of the jurors who ALL didn't believe in spanking. None of the defense's evidence was allowed in the trial which could have cleared my sister. Is there anything you can do, or recommend my family to do? We are all distraught over this and are having a very difficult time.  Knowing our sister is innocent is heart breaking. 
Sorry to bend your ear so much.  I do pray you respond at your earliest convenience.
God Bless, Janice VanOrmer

Some things I forgot to mention with regard to the Christine Stanley Case.  The "investigation" such as it was, or if it was, did not include questioning Christine's family members, who certainly could shed light on the family situation.  Another thing is that while the court allowed a "bruise specialist" to testify that the bruises the teen had on her were old and not inflicted the night of the incident, they refused to allow the jury to know that the teen had attended "boot camp" just prior to the incident [where her family contends she got the bruises].  Also, Children and Family Services seems to be concerned with getting the teen back in contact with the young brother she threatened to kill in his sleep, which doesn't sound like a good policy to me.  I am also told that every person on the jury was against giving a child a spanking, which seems to me to tilt the scales of justice from the beginning.  Also, there is talk of letting the teen be removed from the state by the lady she is currently staying with.  I may be wrong, but that seems to me to be removing the child from the jurisdiction of the state and possibly forever separating her from her family.  Her family still loves her and wants to save her from herself and the streets.  Please help this family if you can.  They are losing their mother to jail and their daughter to whatever she is into that is ruining her life.  There is so much out there today for kids to get into, what with drugs, alcohol, gangs, the Internet and all types of bad other inflences, there's no telling what a teen can fall for and become involved in.  The sad thing is, some of them end up paying for their bad decisions for the rest of their lives.  She may want revenge on her mother today, but what kind of guilt with she face later when she gets older and realizes how much her mother loves her and how hard she was trying to save her, only to be put in jail because of an immature teenager?
All the way around, this seems like a no-win situation to me for this family.   Anything you could do would be appreciated.

Sure!  She's approached this in a very thoughtful way.  I've tried to answer it from a broad governor-esque perspective, but also from a perspective that lets her know you know your reading research -- and that the research is driving your initiative...
 
Please don't roll your eyes -- let me know if you want a shorter response.  You may want to leave out the budget information.
mlo
 
 
Thanks for your email, Catherine.  I really appreciate your thoughtful comments.
 
I would agree with you that the majority of Just Read, Florida! activities in the past year have focused mainly on the early grades.  That is partly because of the abundance of clear research that tells us what needs to happen in K-3, as well as the support from the feds through the Reading First grant to implement that research.  The focus is there also because of the 3rd grade retention law -- so that we stop sending children to 4th grade when they cannot read independently.
 
I would also agree with you that we need to bring research-based efforts to middle and high school struggling readers and teachers as well.  In my proposed budget, I recommend 30 million dollars for Just Read, Florida! and plan on directing a large portion of that to the training of middle and high school teachers, as well as to helping districts put the best proven reading programs in place that can help middle and high school students catch up.  I'll also point out that we have recommended earmarking 3 million of the Critical Teacher Shortage Funds specifically for reading, so that middle and high school teachers can go after our new reading endorsement.
 
As you’ve said in your email, it is true that "with sustained effort, every child can learn to read at the 3rd or 4th grade level." But it is important to recognize that there are many children that will need explicit and systematic instruction throughout their academic careers in order to prevent some from becoming part of that 70% prison population with low-literacy skills.  And, as you have said, it is also true that "substantive change in current teaching and assessment practices and policies" is needed to develop proficient readers. Our reading endorsement is poised to address that very issue.
 
We cannot assume that just because a middle or high school student can pronounce a word on a page means that student is a fluent reader.  The only way we can ensure that a student is fluent, with a good vocabulary and strong comprehension skills is to track that student's progress throughout the year.  Our assessment model of screening, diagnosis and progress monitoring will assure that students are progressing as they need to.  And we must ensure that teachers have the skills to do this.
 
For too long we have confused literacy instruction with literature instruction. Middle and high school students that are not fluent readers will not be able to comprehend well. And, finally, as you had done so well at Savannah State University, we can and must explicitly model higher-level thinking skills in order for students to comprehend challenging text.  But in for order for students to handle the amount of ideas and the volume of work demanded at the college level, we have to ensure that students are independent readers.

Thanks again for your email, and I look forward to continuing this discussion with you.

Subject: Literacy issues
Importance: High



Dear Governor Bush,

 

I recently read an article about you in the Washington Post when I was in Washington a few days ago, and mention was made of your preference for email. I thought I would introduce myself to you this way, since we are not likely to meet in person. I did attend the meeting you held with the state university presidents and the education deans, but there was little opportunity for any extended dialogue. I would like to share with you my perspectives on reading based not only on my experience as the dean of education at your flagship university, but also as one who has done research on language and culture issues (I have dual training as both an anthropologist and psychologist), and finally, as a former English teacher. 

 

First, I would like to commend you on the intense focus you have placed on helping children become more proficient readers, especially your emphasis on the early grades. You are absolutely right in your insistence that if children do not learn to read, they will be a serious disadvantage later in life. No doubt you are familiar with the statistics that indicate that 70% of people in prison have a third grade literacy level or less, and that many occupations will remain inaccessible to those who cannot read well. I also believe your Just Read Florida initiative will be successful because it incorporates parents and community members into the reading process more extensively. These are laudable goals, and you certainly have the support of many of my college faculty behind you in this campaign. 

 

However, I am deeply concerned that the current campaign appears to be focused too narrowly on the early grades, and does not emphasize strategies and practices that are necessary to help children achieve higher levels of literacy. After about fourth grade, reading ability takes a qualitative jump from simple decoding skills to higher order abilities such as analyzing and synthesizing information, interpreting multiple kinds of text, and critical reasoning skills. In short, children have to acquire and use multiple literacies from a number of domains in order to be successful. The fact is that with sustained effort, every child can learn to read at about the 3rd to 4th grade level.  Getting every child to read at grade level (e.g., 12th grade by the time they leave high school) is a Herculean task, and one that I do not believe will be accomplished without substantive changes in current teaching and assessment practices and policies.

 

Let me list some of the problems, and then relate an anecdote from a workshop I recently conducted at Savannah State University in South Carolina, a historically black college. The first problem is that most reading materials in our culture basically are written at about the 6th to 7th grade level. The most popular newspaper, USA Today, is written at this level, as are many well known magazines. The average high school textbook has been dumbed down with extensive pictures to be at about the 8th grade level. It’s no wonder that students who then go to attend a first rate university are in shock when they encounter college texts, since they really are written at that level. Furthermore, this culture does not reward people who read extensively and well; in fact, such people (outside the academy) are considered “nerds.” The only way to get more proficient at reading is to do quite a lot of it, but students’ attention today is captured by a variety of media where concentrated, sustained engagement with the object of study is not necessary. Unless students have extensive experience with a high quality curriculum taught by an expert teacher who can engage them with a text, and sharpen their thinking skills in the process, they are not likely to achieve these higher literacy levels. 

 

My points above were vividly brought to life in the workshop I taught at Savannah State. I had been called in to give them some technical advice on the Georgia Regents Reading Test, which all college students in the state must pass in order to graduate. The test consists of 10 passages, with about 6 questions each, for a total of 60 questions. The test is one hour in length. The questions assess students’ competency in four domains: literal (ability to understand factual information); vocabulary, inferential (ability to draw conclusions), and analysis (ability to recognize tone, genres, and figurative language like metaphors). Savannah State has the lowest student passing rate in the state, and I was asked to provide strategies for helping students perform better. 

 

In working with the students, you may be interested to learn what I discovered. One, all of the students could read the passages in the sense that no one had a decoding problem or couldn’t recognize letters, sounds, etc. Two, they generally did well on the literal questions, and had problems with only a few vocabulary words. The main problems were with the inferential and analysis questions, and these problems can be traced back to students’ lack of familiarity with these kinds of materials and teaching techniques for helping them understand what they were reading. In other words, it was their lack of knowledge that held them back, not their lack of ability. Once I showed them how the text was constructed, and probed their thinking about it, they were able to respond. One of the English professors at the university was in the room with me, and she noted that when she taught a similar workshop, all the students who worked with her passed the test. A common reaction expressed by many of the students was regret that they had never been exposed to this form of teaching (what I call teaching for conceptual understanding) and more sophisticated reading materials. Given that most of them came from poor rural schools with few resources, I was not surprised at these comments. 

 

What I hope you will thoughtfully consider is that the mode of instruction, and the corresponding assessment, used in the early grades to build basis literacy skills are not the ones that should be used in later grades. Unfortunately, what I see in Florida is a one size fits all approach to instruction and assessment, and that approach is unlikely to produce the results you want. Even worse, the poorest children are the least likely to get the most skilled teachers who really know how to build a conceptual understanding of literacy that is grounded in rich contextual experiences with multiple texts. While you have funded initiatives to support the development of early reading skills, a direction I certainly agree is important, I hope you will also support initiatives that promote conceptual understanding of literacy across different domains. I believe there are faculty available at UF and around the state who can assist in this effort, and I would be happy to answer any questions you might have as to how this might be done. 

 

By the way, have you ever thought about what would happen if we actually did succeed in enabling every student to leave high school reading at grade level?

Sir, this op-ed by Linda Chavez in today's Washington Times should be read by Republican leaders. I'd like to see Republicans fight for the Miguel Estrada nomination the way they fought for Florida in the 2000 election aftermath. The stakes are almost as high. If necessary, Republicans should litigate what is clearly a separation of powers issue-a minority of Senators should not be able to thwart the President's constitutional authority to appoint judges and the judicial branches authority to administer justice.

Dear Governor Bush;  I am a supporter of the Bush
family in every way.  I am also the neighbor of Else
White who knows you personally and she gave me your
e-mail and she can vouch for my character.  My boys
take care of her yard for free simply because she is
elderly and a widow and we should do that.  My sister
Christine Stanley is in jail after a conviction on
2/20/03 in the St. John's County for child abuse.  Her
trial was so unfair.  They would not even allow much
of a defense and Judge Robert K. Mathis pre-selected
the jurors who all believe in no spanking.  They made
my sister out to be a monster.  She has sent you
several e-mails in the recent past pleading her case. 
You will probably be getting more e-mails regarding
this situation.  My niece lied about the incident and
claims by her and the DCF that she was tortured.  I
saw her right after the incident and she was not
tortured.  She fought her parents who were tring to
discipline her and she went crazy all over the house. 
A Bruise Expert says the bruises were older than the
incident and another child that was in the Diversion
Program with Andrea saw most of the bruises before she
got spanked.  Andrea was in the Diversion program for
assaulting an officer.  She has lied on other extreme
matters and not one family member believes her.  My
sister is not guilty of child abuse.  I have temporary
custody of my sister's 4 year old, Christian Stanley. 
His father is doing the case plan to get him back but
the DCF keep adding more on him.  This child has never
been abused and loves his parents and want to go home
with both of them.  He is well taken care of but we
are not his parents and he is very very bright and
wants to go home.  Not one family member was
questioned on this incident.  They solely took the
word of Andrea who took this opportunity to get away
from her strick home and live elsewhere.  The mother
of the family she is now with has a prior drug use
conviction and Andrea has been raped by a 21 year old
while in their care.  The DCF has yet to remove her
from this family and not only that, they let her move
to Lakeland with them.  The DCF organization is
appalling as they destroy families and do not try to
mend them.  I have heard so many complaints.  I guess
what I am asking at this point is, can you request
that Judge Mathis have mercy and on the day of her
sentencing April 17, 2003 and say sentence served in
full? Please, this is the most unjust thing I have
ever witnessed.  I am pleading with all my heart and
so are the rest of my family members.  Christine
Stanley does not deserve to be in jail.  Christian
Stanley needs to go home with his Daddy Virgil Stanley
and Christine needs to come home to them both.  Andrea
needs help not rewards.  She is 14 years old and has
much to learn.  She was doing cheers in the courtyard
of the courthouse while the jurors were deliberating
whether her mother faces jail. The bible says in the
last days the children will rise up against the
parents.  This is coming to pass. Please help us and
God Bless, Gail Cain, 12829 Helm Drive, Jacksonville,
Fl. 32258

Dear Gov. Bush,
As a parent of a daughter in 11th grade, as well as a teacher, I would
like to see you make some accomodations for students who want to go to
college after high school, but can't pass the FCAT, even though they are
earning A's and B's in their classes.
Colleges require a high school diploma for entrance, but what is my
daughter to do if she can't pass the FCAT again?
 She wants to be an elementary school teacher. She was only 7 points
away from passing the last FCAT tests, she has all A's and B's in her
classes, but what IF she and others in her same circumstance can't pass
the FCAT by graduation? Are they supposed to work at McDonalds the rest
of their lives?
Don't you think there needs to be some other considerations for students
who want to go forward with their education and have grades above a 2.0
in their high schools?
To the many students who just want to graduate and work at any kind of
job after high school, a standard diploma isn't as important to them,
but to students who want to go to COLLEGE and do more with their lives
and for society, there needs to be some sort of flexibility in your
rules. 
Please consider this suggestion.
                  Thank you,

Dear Governor Bush,

This is an unabashed promotional piece for me and my company, Com <http://www.comnective.com> nective. I'm hoping to get your attention away from your duties as Florida's leader for a moment to let you know what I'm doing in the hope that you'll remember me if you need or learn of someone who could use the help of someone with my skills.

For the last 20 years, I've been involved in helping my various employers and clients communicate with their customers, prospects, government, the media and other key audiences. Fifteen years ago, I started helping people apply computers and other technologies to enhance their efforts to communicate with key audiences.

Three years ago, I founded Comnective with the intent of helping people and organizations understand and cope with the fact that their future success will at least partially depend on how well they manage "the point where communication and technology meet" for their organization.



  <http://www.comnective.com/Images/bf.jpg> 



In other words, I believe that there is an appropriate, unique and cost-effective mix of old-fashioned and high-tech communication tools that should be brought to bear by every organization. The choices people make today about how to take advantage of this convergence will determine tomorrow's winners and losers. Currently, too many people and companies get advice about communicating messages and assistance with the tools necessary to distribute messages from separate sources. The "cart" isn't even attached to the "horse."



  _____  



Tools that can expand your reach


  <http://www.comnective.com/Images/reachstar.gif> 	
Recent developments in Internet technologies allow me to help organizations deliver interactive personalized messages, action alerts, newsletters, meeting notices and other key communications instantly without having to deal with the costs associated with hard-copy communications. 

This e-mail is an example of what I refer to as "Branded Group Communications." While this "rich-format" message appears to be addressed only to you, it actually was automated to be personalized with your name and some other pertinent phrases, then sent to a list of some of my elected and appointed friends.  Not only is this kind of mail attention-getting, but it also makes communication to lists more secure.

How many times have you gotten messages in which your e-mail address is exposed either in the "To" or the "Cc" field, along with numerous other addresses?  Are you aware that your information can easily be captured by any of those recipients (or those to whom the message is forwarded) for inclusion on other lists?  The potential for your information being harvested for "spamming" purposes is great.  You certainly do not want to put your clients, prospects or friends in such a similar situation.  My methods help you avoid such difficulties.


	

  _____  


So, Governor,what I'd like for you to do is... 


When you find yourself grappling with which technical communications tools are appropriate for your needs, wondering how to maximize the return on your existing technology investments, or becoming interested in automating some or all of your key communication to staff or constituents, remember that I'm here to help. Then call me at (954) 532-5956 or drop  <mailto:finch@comnective.com?subject=I%20received%20your%20%20message%20and%20I%20would%20like%20to%20discuss%20what%20you%20can%20do%20for%20me!> me a note so we can get to work!

I really appreciate your taking the time to read this communiqué. It is not my desire to intrude upon you in the future if you aren't interested, so I am building a list of people who wish to receive periodic communication tips, commentary, technology alerts and other useful information.

Rick Barnett, a local real estate broker, ran against Richard on the republican ticket in the last election.   Richard won the race but it was close.    Rick has every qualification for the job.  In addition, he is a loyal hard working republican who was very active in your campaign and the campaign of your brother, our wonderful president.

Governor, I had the honor yesterday of notifying Senator Toni Jennings that she has been named a Woman of Distinction by the Girl Scouts of Citrus Council (Orlando).  You may recall this is the event that honored Mayor Glenda Hood, Sara Trollinger and Raiza Tamayo last year.  Today I read in The Orlando Sentinel that she is under consideration to serve as your Lt. Governor.  What a great choice she would be for you, for women and, most of all, for the State of Florida.

Mary
 
We agree with everything you say, and we want to add
a different spin
 
Eight years ago we were told our daughter was not 
college material because she was three years behind in
reading and would probably fail the high school
test, which was used at that time instead of the FCAT
 
We then developed a program to help her.
 
Julie will graduate this year from the University of Florida
and become a Special Education teacher -- she improved her reading 4.2 grade levels in 7 months and since then we have helped hundreds of students with some students improving their reading 2, 3 and even 4 years within a year
 
Along the way we learned several key points that could
help the students both this week and in the longer term
 
Advice For This Week

*	If they have an accommodation in their IEP that allows them to take the tests untimed make sure this happens -- I would go as far as to escort my child in on the first day of testing and make sure this happens -- these students often process slowly and extra time is a fair and legal way to level the playing field

*	Children will be tense, do whatever you can to calm them down and especially fill them with confidence

*	If the school allows it make sure they have water with them and they sip it --it helps

*	Spend a few minutes going over practice tests and give them little hints -- even eliminating wrong answers will help

*	Remind them that even in the worst case this is not big deal

In the longer term:

*	Help your child get better -- fighting is good but addressing the issue is vital to your child

*	If your child has ADHD and it impacts their academic performance you may qualify for an IEP under Other Health Impaired 

*	Check for your child's learning style and to see if they have vision issues -- there is a free assessment at www.3dlearner.com

*	Find a way to improve their attention -- we recommend the Interactive Metronome (R), while we can help the people near Coral Springs, you can locate a provider near you at  www.interactivemetronome.com 

*	Get help for them -- these problems can be addressed but schools are not the only the source of educational assistance-- there are other professionals like us, and you want to find one that fits your child's needs

*	For your information the kind of child we help: 


*	Is good at remembering places they have been and movies they have seen 

*	Learns best when they see and experience information 

*	Is often smart in many ways, but reading comprehension is often a major issue

Again a FREE Assessment is available at www.3dlearner.com 
 
We have programs for individuals, groups and we offer teleseminars -- we also have a speech for either parent or professional groups entitled
 
The Right Parents & Professionals Make The Difference (TM)

Subject: FCAT levels of comfort

Dear Mr. Edmonds,
 
It is with great concern that I read your quote,
 
"Our sense is that people are losing their apprehension for the FCAT," 
said Bill Edmonds, a spokesman for the Department of Education. "Most 
families are growing comfortable with it, and hopefully, learning to 
appreciate its value."
 
I am grateful for your remarks in that they encouraged me to craft the following rebuttal:
 
Your statement is uninformed and rather glib in the face of a test that has actually caused physical illness and more. Moreover, as the mother of seven children, I have had exposure to this test, and the stress is severe for each child approaching it anew. Furthermore, my twin children who are experiencing it for the first time this year have been tested for enrollment in the gifted program in our town because of academic achievement, and yet one of them is in danger of failing the FCAT because of his inability to concentrate well. My children are much too concerned about succeeding for their teacher and for their school than any child should be. The threat of failure hanging over their heads at this age is more stressful and damaging to the family unit than you can imagine, apparently. We are clearly not learning to appreciate it, as you suggest, because it is a poor tool to use in measurement of educational quality of schools. It comes with a price all too dear for most of us - the health, self-esteem and well being of our children... not to mention teachers, parents, and administrators.
 
A comment about one of the factual situations for those whose children have disabilities but for whom there are no accommodations, such as the young, intelligent man from Port Orange who has dyslexia - the failure of this test will define him - and therefore so will his disability define him - which is a poor measurement of this young man and his skill and talent. He has proven that he seeks success as his academic record shows. Should he be redefined as a failing, non-graduating senior by virtue of FCAT? Of course in this day and age we are all enlightened enough to realize that a disability is not a defining measurement of a person... Wouldn't you agree that failure of this test which could be directly attributed to the student's dyslexic condition and lack of accommodations for it would certainly effect his self-esteem and confidence? I imagine that his family would never "appreciate the value of FCAT".
 
Many successful people have achieved their personal success in spite of their disability, and yes there are those who have achieved great success without even being able to read using normal standards. I implore you to ask yourself why then it should be permissible for a state to set the stage for failure as they have done through FCAT testing. 
 
I would be remiss if I didn't mention that there are many other scenarios that I didn't address, where FCAT is of negative impact to the life - not just the grade level - of a child and their family -just look in the paper, on the internet, etc. Conversely, I have read and heard very little about those who feel that it has had a positive impact on the academic experience of their child. We await a better plan. We have paid, elected officials who should be burning the midnight oil creating a positive solution instead of harmless children laying awake in fear of failure. 
 
I welcome feedback from you as well as from others to which this email has been sent, and in the meantime, after having worked every evening with my kids on this frightening test, look forward to March 13th as the end of an exhausting, intimidating, and unnecessary two and one half months. ...And we hope that our kids are able to exemplify to the state what their teacher and I already know about them.
 
Sincerely,
 
Mary O'Meara

Jeb, 

I am asking for your help in a matter to do with our Tournament Referee Alan Mills and a temporary Visa.  Alan Mills has been our Tournament Referee for the over the past 10 years.  We applied for his visa in September as we always do and for some reason this year we still have not received anything from INS.  The only information we can get is that it is still pending.  As you know the tournament is only 2 weeks away so we are getting a little concerned.

We have contacted Ileana Ros-Lehtinen's office and she is submitting a letter for Monday delivery to Evelyn Upchurch, Director of INS (Texas Office) to ask for her intervention.   He is due to fly into the U.S. on March 13th.  If there is any way you can help to expedite this matter it would be greatly appreciated.

Let me know. 

Thank You,

February 28, 2003

Mr. Jeb Bush,

I have never been one to get involved in the political realm other than
consciously voting during every election.  As a public school employee,
I
feel it is time to speak my mind.  It is my hope that Mr. Bush himself
will
take the time to read this letter.

My daughter, Sarah, is probably one of the hardest working students you
will
ever meet.  She is the type of young person who pushes herself to the
limit,
studying nightly till 9:00 p.m. or later to make sure she gets the best
grades possible in school.  As you know, she and her fellow students are
now
required to pass the FCAT in order to be awarded a high school diploma.
This is a requirement she, and many others, will probably never meet.
It
isn't because she isn't trying.  She visits the FCAT Explorer site
daily,
has two tutors, and stays after school four days a week for additional
help
on the test.

Depending on the report you study, Florida ranks somewhere between 48'TH
and
last in its high school graduation rate!  What are we thinking?  I fully
understand the need to raise educational standards and have always
supported
doing so until the FCAT requirement.  It is a crime for a good student
to
attend school for twelve years, earn 24 credits, hold at least a 2.0
grade
point average and then walk away without a high school diploma because
of a
single test!   It appears to me that we are leaving quite a few young
people
behind!

Obviously, as a teacher, I am a believer in the public school system.  I
have learned that private schools are not required to give this test.  I
would guess that most of our legislators probably send their children to
private schools.  However, for most of us, this is not an option.  Have
you
and our legislature taken the time to closely examine the FCAT?  My
guess is
no.  I doubt seriously that most of our legislators could earn a passing
score on the test.

Again, I understand the need for standards.  Not all students are
college
bound, but all students are required to attend high school.  I have no
problem with entrance exams at the college level, but to deny our young
people a fair beginning in life is just unfair!  I wish you could meet
Sarah
and the thousands of students like her.  This next week will be a
particularly difficult time for each and every one of them as they take
the
FCAT.  Many will simply give up!

I honestly believe that the State of Florida will pay dearly for our
poor
graduation rate.  In ten years there may not be enough prisons to hold
all
our young citizens who were doomed from the beginning of their adulthood
when they were not awarded a high school diploma.  Please carefully
consider
this letter.  There are literally thousands of parents who feel the way
I
do.  Let's find a better way to educate the State of Florida's youth!

I eagerly await your response to my thoughts...

Respectfully,
Jim Way

Subject: Stolen Marriage Vows


Good afternoon Governor Bush,

The time has come to put a stop to the endless stampede of divorces in this wonderful state of Florida as everything about a marriage termination adversely affects our society, including the state welfare budget. Let us STOP the divorce industry, cut the budget, and give the money to those who need a raise. 

Most people have been touched by a divorce, either their own, or that of a relative, friend or a co-worker. While divorce certainly devastates the spouse, how do you think the children feel? I'm sure they truly want to keep the marriage and family together, but don't know how to make that happen. Certainly having a loving family and home on which to build their lives is needed. Divorce removes BOTH of those...for LIFE.

I know there are exceptions, but we are talking about those who do not want a FORCED DIVORCE because they cannot defend themselves in divorce court. Correct me if I am wrong, but the procedure right now is: NO voice, NO choice, NO appeal...DONE DEAL......B-E-F-O-R-E court convenes. 

I'm sure you would agree this is a society issue. The sniper had 2 divorces done to him and his actions are a real possibility after any divorce. Life is tough enough without fearing the actions of a DIVORCE RECIPIENT. The Oklahoma bomber came from a broken home. The American citizen fighting from Afghanistan against American citizens came from a broken home. The 15-year-old who flew a plane into a tower in Florida came from a broken home. 

Many of the students in the school shootings came from broken homes.

I believe you are a compassionate man and have the kind of influence which can do something about the injustices done to marriages and families in the divorce courts. Please do whatever is within the power of your office to warm up the YES vote for marriages and families. Your actions will determine the outcome of this as the general public keeps a close watch on you and your family members. 


Why not make this the year when Florida "leads the way" in stabilizing our society by granting due process to the defendant in a divorce case? It is guaranteed by the Constitution of these United States, but not practiced in divorce courts in Florida. 

There are many in Florida who are waiting for you to take the necessary action on this issue by doing what is right and standing against the "marriage and family quitters" who are rewarded for their actions as well as those in the legal profession who get richer as marriages and families are destroyed. 

As one who has experienced the injustices of the divorce court in Florida (Brevard County),   I will keep holding on with prayers of expectation (HOPE - 1 Timothy 2) for the power of God's divine influence to prevail in the heart of my lovely wife Cheryl so she will see how the enemy has deceived her into thinking other pleasures are more important than honoring the promises we made to our Heavenly Father (and each other) on the glorious day of our wedding (8-15-82), I ask for your help in changing the system.

Respectively,

P. S. For a description of the problems associated with the No-Fault laws from a point of view by a fellow Christian (Michael McManus of  <http://www.marriagesavers.org/> www.marriagesavers.org )I would encourage you to take a look at a commentary he recently wrote (  <http://www.marriagesavers.org/Columns/C1111.htm> http://www.marriagesavers.org/Columns/C1111.htm ) as I'm sure you will find it to be most enlightening. 

I personally know the person he names in the commentary (Billy Miller of Alexandria, Louisiana), as he is a fellow believer who is also "standing in the gap" for a restored wife and experiencing the joy of a healed marriage. 

The following is what he recently shared with me about the matter. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PLEASE consider helping us make this a "national issue" with outcry from the masses as has been done over the sexual abuse in the Roman Catholic Church. Some who have had the "divorce court treatment" in our group are Catholic. Thanks for whatever you are able to do. The courts MUST protect our marriages because they are protected by the Constitution of these United States.

Billy Miller - RECONCILIATION!
 <mailto:billyrm4@bellsouth.net> billyrm4@bellsouth.net 


"I do" is for a LIFETIME! I said "I do" and I STILL do.

Success in marriage is BEING the right person, not FINDING the right person.
Being wife-Mother and husband-Father does not carry an expiration date.
Divorce is not a solution to any marriage problem.


You will definitely want to read the book Stolen Vows by Judy Parejko (  <http://www.StolenVows.com/> www.StolenVows.com ) for extensive information on this subject and to see how mediation "feeds" the divorce industry, rather than bringing healing in a sick marriage. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I would also be glad to share a copy of the Press Release for Stolen Vows and the Divorce Awareness Proclamation document, which President George W. Bush signed when he was Governor of Texas.

Subject: Re: Osceola County

Shelly,

The parents with children with DD who I know are already taking care of and
now the information is giving to the schools, I made sure of that. What I
meant was there is a lot of parents who were discouraged by this worker
Myrta Perez..The other night at the ESE Family night, I was listening to a
parent who registered her child but the file was lost. This parent
registered two years ago when Myrta was still working in Osceola
County...Now they have to start allover again.
What I was really asking is if there was anything that DD could do for
these children who were victims of a bad worker who basically did
everything to discourage people..She did it to me too, when I called 3
years ago even that my child was registered with DD in 1989 when we moved
here from NY. She said that I could move in another State if I wanted
services..and when I told her that I was not going to move, she said that I
could put my child in a foster home and loose my rights as parent. After
that I found her Supervisor number and I refused to talk to her ever again.
I had tears of rage in my eyes and I called the local Newspaper to take the
story but they wouldn't. Now, imagine the other parents...They gave up..I
didn't...
As a group leader I know quite a bit of parents and children now, it does
bugs me that I can't do anything for them.
Thank you for taking the time on the week-end to answer me back.

Beatrice

    I just got back in town from Washington D. C. and hear you might
need
another plane to fly. I am glad that nobody was injured but you are
going to
have to be more selective on choosing your mode of transportation. Also,
I
heard that you were considering Gaston Cantens for Lt. Gov. I have had
the
opportunity to work with Gaston these past few years. He has been a
pleasure
to work with and seems to be very honest and hard working. I know the
Florida Home Builders and myself thinks he would be a good addition to
your
team.
    Last week  I met with a couple of the members from the Worker Comp
task

had
time to read it but, I do know that my company as of March 31 will not
be
able to renew our worker comp policy. I have heard from several people
around the state with the same problem. It seems that we will have a
severe

I
can be of help. Say hello to your wife and I hope all is well her.

  _____  


TALLAHASSEE -- Senate President Jim King has so little use for Gov. Jeb Bush's scorched-earth budget -- "butt ugly," he called it -- that when he said the Senate might enact it line for line some people figured him to be bluffing. 


He wasn't. King's strategy, born of desperation, was to drive home to the public "that this is not a make-believe crisis." He hoped to ignite public pressure on the governor and the House for new revenue. If worst still came to worst, it would be be the governor's budget, not the Senate's. 


"If no one is going to give me a single dollar more," King explained, "then if I go into the governor's budget to 'fix it,' I have to fix it off the backs of somebody else. . . . Have I really done anything other than reorganize the angst?" 


But that was before. Now, King -- the lonely moderate among Florida's top three politicians -- needs a new strategy even more desperately. Bush's budget turns out to be unbalanced, says King. The constitution requires balanced budgets. So the Senate could not pass it without major changes that would bear the Senate's fingerprints. 


It's a tangle over trust funds, moneys earmarked from taxes levied for such specific services as affordable housing, environmental lands and toxic waste cleanup. 


According to Sen. Ken Pruitt, R-Port St. Lucie, the appropriations chairman, Bush's budget writers helped themselves to "hundreds of millions of dollars" more than can be legally or prudently diverted to fund schools, Medicaid and other programs. Pruitt's staff expects to pin down the sum early this week. 


The options would then be to cut the programs thus funded even more deeply than the governor did, propose taxes that would be dead on arrival at the House, or lob the budget back to the governor for a supplemental recommendation. 


As the Legislature prepares for the formal opening of its 2003 session Tuesday, few members believe that the constitutionally prescribed 60 days will see the end of it. Some wonder whether they will have enacted a budget in time to avoid a government shutdown on July 1. 


Legislatures have gone to the brink before, but seldom have the stars been so misaligned as now. Though all the key players are Republican, that's about all they have in common. 


Bush, a libertarian at heart who dreams aloud of emptying government buildings, opposes new state taxes. He implies he would accept them next year, which would be unlikely, even with his support, in an election year. Meanwhile, Bush's $54-billion budget would hit the universities hard to help pay for reducing class sizes in public schools under a constitutional initiative, Amendment 9, that Bush opposed. College students would pay higher tuition with nothing to show for it. 


"Tuition increases are a tax hike," says Pruitt. "They're being hypocritical when they say they don't have a tax increase." Similarly, Bush would pass off to the counties $64-million in juvenile detention charges. 


Democrats complain, and some Republicans privately agree, that Bush is using Amendment 9 as a pretext to continue shrinking the state government and as an excuse for more private school vouchers. At this point, Bush appears to have muted the public school lobby (and split the education community) by treating the universities much worse. 


Though Bush repudiated what he once called a "devious" scheme to undermine Amendment 9 with unpopular consequences, there's widespread belief that this is still his strategy. King, despite asserting "an obligation to do my very, very, very best to fulfill it," said it's not out of the question that legislators might ask the voters to repeal the initiative. But to do so in time to affect the next budget would require a three-fourths vote in each house, which is unlikely. "I wouldn't get all the Republicans," King said. 


Johnnie B. Byrd Jr., of Plant City, the House speaker, is Bush's ideological soul mate in regards to taxes, smaller government and private school vouchers. He was a key obstacle to Senate President John McKay's tax reform efforts last year. This year, Byrd got House-Senate relations off to a memorably foul start by accusing the Senate and King of a secret scheme to raise taxes by $11.5-billion. There was no secret and no scheme, only a publicly issued list of well-known revenue options totaling that much. Byrd has behaved himself since, but King got the message: Don't bring taxes to the House. 


King, oldest (63) and by far the most politically experienced of the three -- he was elected to the House in 1986, two years before Byrd moved to Florida -- is a moderate, a pragmatist, and, as it happens, the only member of the ruling triumvirate who attended the Florida universities that would be the biggest losers in Bush's budget. His experience and instinct are a good fit for a Senate that prizes its collegiality and bipartisanship. His problem is that the House -- King calls it "the house of No" -- is run from the top down. No one but the marginalized Democratic minority, who trail the Republicans 39 to 81, is prepared to openly buck Byrd's policies. 


For incoming House members, the only sure path to leadership before their eight years run out is through the patronage of those already in power. This is not a factor in the Senate, where most members are continuing career paths that began in the House. 


The agenda would be tough even for a more harmonious legislature. A record six insurance issues, all of them contentious, are on the table: medical malpractice, no-fault auto insurance, worker's compensation, nursing homes, the state's hurricane fund, and the shaky state of the private health insurance market. A bitter fight is already brewing over Senate efforts to weaken the antismoking initiative voters approved in November, and some legislators want to repeal the high-speed rail initiative from the 1998 election. 


Gambling interests are angling again for slot machines at Florida's race tracks, touting taxes from a so-called "video lottery" as a painless palliative for the budget woes. But opposition from the governor and Byrd make this unlikely. 


Gambling is only one of many sources the Senate would consider, but King and Pruitt see no point in voting on any without some sign of interest from the House. 


Pruitt says Senate budget hearings in mid-February were disappointing because there was less of a public outcry than expected. Pruitt blames that in large part on the public schools, which he says "deserve an F" for not asking for more than Bush proposed. The same goes, he said, for the university and college trustees, who left it to their presidents to make the case for more money. 


"The trustees have forgotten the definition of 'trustee,' he said. "This is ground zero. This is where it was supposed to happen, and it didn't happen." 


Now, a free-for-all begins.

Governor:
 
I’m forwarding you a copy of a letter that one of my Miami associates, Steve Brodie, mailed to Phil Bond at the U.S. Department of Commerce. Isaac Serure’s problem to date has not been remedied.
 
In Tampa, I know of a chemical company experiencing a similar business problem in Peru.   It would be helpful if Enterprise Florida or some government agency could look into the matter to determine if this is a pattern of Peruvian business behavior.  If there is a problem, perhaps the findings can be of help to businesses with Peruvian problems and to companies planning to do business there.
 
A participant in your trade mission to Spain told me that you did a fantastic job and the scheduled activities were excellent.
 
Good luck on the upcoming legislative session.  I know it’s tough.

Dear Mr. Bond:
 
            I like to thank you for taking the time to talk with my partner, Governor Bob Martinez.  As Governor Martinez discussed, our client Isaac Serure is facing some challenging and unfair treatment in Peru.  Pursuant to your request, we are providing you with this letter which addresses some of these issues.  Further, if possible, we would appreciate if you could schedule a meeting for Mr. Serure to meet with the U.S. Secretary of Commerce during his trip to Peru.
 
            Mr. Serure is a U.S. citizen who resides in Miami, Florida.  Mr. Serure is a businessman who has spent a great deal of my time promoting business throughout the Caribbean basin and Latin America.  As a businessman in South Florida he understood a number of years ago that South Florida would serve as the gateway for business between the United States and Latin America.  As such, he was one of the pioneer businessman who traveled to Latin American countries and tried to identify business opportunities.  Mr. Serure always operated under the belief, that it was in the best interest of the U.S. and the foreign countries for Americans to invest in these countries.  
 
            Mr. Serure is actively involved with businesses throughout Peru and Brazil and, has been active with the respective Chambers of Commerce to promote trade and business between the U.S. and these countries.  However, he has recently experienced and has heard from other U.S. businesspersons that there is a lack of equality of how these foreign governments and their judicial systems treat U.S. businesspersons.  While Mr. Serure hates to claim that Americans are discriminated against in these foreign countries, it is clear that they are not being treated fairly.  
 
            In particular, Isaac Serure as a trustee for various business enterprises has had many problems with both the business community and judicial system in Peru.  There are currently several cases in the Peruvian court system that are being curtailed solely due to the case involving a foreigner.  The following are just a few examples of some of the problems which confront Mr. Serure.
 
1.	Funds were loaned to a real estate developer. Notes were signed by the appropriate parties. The notes came due and the borrower defaulted. The borrower then refused to pay the notes. The borrower is currently being sued. Their defense is that the notes were paid. The lender asks only to show proof that the loans were paid (i.e. check, wire transfer, etc.). Nothing has been forthcoming. The courts have done nothing to assist in this matter. The courts are constantly delaying in making any rulings. An accountant was hired by the borrower, to prove their case, and he said that the loans were repaid. However, when proof of the loan payoff was requested, again, no proof was shown. This case is still in the courts. 
 
2.	In another instance homes were built with investors funds (project 1). The developer charged costs from another real estate project (project 2), that was being built, to project 1. An accounting showed that some of the costs of project 2 were charged to project 1. When the developer was confronted with the proof he denied the allegations and had the accountant who prepared the analysis deny that he prepared the worksheets showing the fraud. A hand writing expert was hired. The expert states unequivocally that the spreadsheets were prepared and signed by the accountant. A fingerprint was also taken from the spreadsheets that proved to be that of the accountant. This case is still before the courts. 
 
            It appears that corruption is effecting remedies available to U.S. businesspersons.  If the United States determines that it is in our best interest to promote business in those countries, then the U.S. government should develop treaties and such other means that ensure U.S. investors will be treated fairly and honestly. 
 
            It is our understanding, that the U.S. Secretary of Commerce is in Peru and that one of the primary purposes of the Secretary’s trip is to address these exact issues.  Since, Mr. Serure has been involved in this region for such a long period of time, it may be beneficial if the U.S. Secretary of Commerce would have the opportunity to learn first hand of some of the obstacles faced by U.S. investors.  Accordingly, it would be greatly appreciated if you could either arrange a meeting for Mr. Serure with the Secretary in Peru, or at least, arrange an opportunity for him to speak by telephone.  Mr. Serure is 


presently in Peru and can be reached at his home number 4214-406, or his cell phone number is 870-5039.  
 
            Mr. Serure strongly believes that in order for the Secretary’s trip to be as successful as everyone would like, having the Secretary learn of actual events can only assist him when he addresses these issues to the government of Peru.
 
            Once again, I thank you for making the time to discuss this matter with Governor Martinez.  Looking forward to hearing from you .  Thanks again.
 
Cordially,

I wouldn't be sending you an email unless something was terribly wrong and 
it is. Jeb, the government is ripping me off. My mother doesn't want her 
financial situation discussed in public, if you even had a clue as to what 
the US government has done to my family you would be horrified. I am beyond 
it. I have yet to receive my tax refund although it was suppose to be in my 
account on the 21st. Today their computers are down! Jeb, I have nothing! I 
had to borrow money so they wouldn't forclose on my house, the company I 
worked for is corrupt (I have no job now) yes, I reported them, my husband 
started a job the day after my dad's funeral. He recieved one paycheck of 
$300 for a couple of days. They pay every two weeks but hold the first 
paycheck. DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO NOT HAVE A DAMN DIME? Needless 
to say there is no work today the day the are suppose to pay him, the IRS is 
"Unavailable", and my mother has not even recieved a damn penny since before 
January from both State and Fed. Now, she doesn't want me talking about it, 
but why the hell is my mother still waiting on her money from an annuity my 
father had with the federal government , she can't even ask for the money 
until she receives the paperwork, WHICH THE GOVERNMENT NEVER SENT! I am 
angrier than I have ever been in my entire freaking life. For real. My 
father has been robbed by the very government he spent his entire life 
working for. How dare this government do this to my family. If you knew the 
entire story you would cry. GOD DAMN IT WHY IS THE GOVERNMENT DOING THIS? 
I'm told less is more by my daughter, but you know I had son turn 16 on 
valentines day and her turn 17 yesterday. You try to get Noelle a present 
with no money. You just try to even get the damn gas money to go to the 
store. But no, you are Jeb Bush and I am just a noone. My faith is gone. My 
dad would always tell me it'll all work out! My dad is dead! And your 
wonderful banks want to take my home. They won't work with anyone. Now, 
right before my dad died back in December I switched car insurance 
companies. GMAC notified the state that I didn't have insurance. I have, I 
do have insurance on my cars (one died the day my dad died)but the State is 
going to cancel my license, my tags and fine me? I have to send 
proof!!!!!!!!!!! BUT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WON'T PAY WHEN SOMEONE DIES IN 
A TIMELY MANNER THEY CAN PAY WHEN THEY WANT? BULLSHIT. I DEMAND DISCLOSURES 
FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ON A PAY DATE ON POLICIES, MY FRIEND LOST HIS 
BUSINESS CUZ INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT HIRED HIM TO DO THE WORK NEVER PAID. I 
AM COMING AFTER INSURANCE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN IN THIS STATE OR THE 
FEDERAL LEVEL. MY FATHER LEFT ME WITH ONE THING, WISDOM. Wisdom to know to 
walk away or turn and fight. I am now fighting. BTW, I overheard a 
conversation the other night, March 3, 2003 is the day we are suppose to get 
hit by terrorists again. 3/3/3 it's the sign of the trinity, you know we are 
in a holy war. The government runs around taking my money for this war that 
obviously is not gonna happen cuz we are all to weak to go to war, we have 
to wait and pay some scumbag country. This government is a mess. Both on a 
state level and federal. Watch pearl harbor the movie, we are just like that 
again. Please pray for my family because it's bad, really bad. I give up on 
your peace processes, peace only exists in the mind not in the world. Oh, I 
have no computer, that died too just like everything else. It's a cold world 
out there Jeb, but you wouldn't know anything about that.

Hi Jeb -  A situation has come to my attention that I need your direction 
regarding.  My mom is one of the youngest of 13 children, all fifth 
generation Floridians.  Her sister next to her in age, now 73, resides in a 
group home in Martin County operated by ARC, and is considered a level 4 or 5

closing their group homes throughout the county due to an underfunding at 
this consumer level.  It is my understanding the current level of funding for

Lucy said that they had to make administrative personnel reductions in addition to the budget reductions already called for, and my position was adversly effected ( or affected?). She was very kind and said I should look for something in one of the districts that I would like to do and would make me happy. That was very nice and very considerate. I didn't contact you to cry about me but to alert you that the function of director of community resources would be deleted. The managers do very well when managed. The DA's follow what can and cannot be solicited when there is someone there to say you can or you can't. Large corporations and donors will get involved when there is a central point of contact and some sense of authority on behalf of the agency like an office and a director. Since Laura called, Amy K has suggested that I stay and work out of a district and do the district manager job and also the statewide job. Both are full time positions and I am not able to do the heavy lifting required in the district. I wouldn't hire me. They either need to leave the position in Tallahassee at central office maybe under external affairs or the office of the Secretary or have another employee in Tallahassee do the job. This won't change after the move to CBC because in the start up phase the lead agencies will need help with coordination and resources. I am sorry to stir up anything but you have been so supportive of our efforts in the past and present I just didn't want the clients hanging out there without the things we provide for them. I know it's a tough year for money and if my salary will make things better than like I said, I am out of here. 
Thanks for caring when you are so very busy and watch that lightning.

I can put this on the agenda but I need to know how much time you think you may need ( I am thinking 20 - 30 minutes) and also what time you would like to be on the agenda. Our board begins with an executive session for board members only from 9 to noon. I can put you in that time frame but you will be unable to sit through that portion of the meeting except when you are "on". I can rearrange the agenda to meet your needs.

I am duly concerned about making any waves this legislative session. I am affiliated with a number of groups ranging from homeschooling to housing to education and everyone is shaking in their boots over the budget. Is it really wise to try to make a change on an 'accountablity' issue when people are going to be in a real bad frame of mind altogether.....

Those are my thoughts -

Marcy,
I am contemplating making some changes to the Home Ed. law. I would like to discuss these changes with your Board before proceding. I will be willing to come to the Feb. 8. Board meeting to have the opportunity to get input from your Directors. They all have working experience with the law and their views will be of great value to me since they work closely with the school districts.
I am just drafted the proposed changes and will be running these by the attorneys on my Board. Then, I will run it by my entire Board. I will have the final wording by February. 
Let me know whether you can accommodate this issue on the agenda so that I can make plans to be in Orlando.

Dear Jeb,
 
  Hello.
With this being the season for the Legislature formal meetings to begin, I bring to you, again, my yearly request.  I ask that you read The Jennifer Act.  
Jim McDonough has a copy of it.  
I wrote The Jennifer Act  because there are families who hurt and suffer and struggle as I am, (for over seven years) with a child addicted to drugs.  These families in crisis need assistance,  support, services and the Law of the Land to be their compass and guide through the crisis that they face. The maze through the court system can be overwhelming.  Families give up trying to assist their loved ones because the challenges they face are many. I have found elected government officials who are compassionate and kind and many who don't care. 
 Families of the addicted face a long journey of set backs, disappointments and relapses.  I know.
 I am in the trenches every day of my life.  I look at it as a war.  The enemy (drug addiction) continues to steal my daughter's life.   I fight for her life, my baby grandson's life and try and use what I have learned to help others who are in the same situation.  It is not easy.  I will never give up on my daughter, Jennifer, or her baby, my only grandson.  Their lives are precious. 
I have asked God many times, "why"?  Through brokenness, He uses us.  His perfect plan and purpose is carried out through us.
I pray that your daughter, Noelle's treatment and recovery is a success. It is for the thousand's of other's who are struggling, that I write The Jennifer Act.
 
In Christ~

My dearest Lord,



I hear the words of those who are hurting.

They are everywhere.

They all need your saving grace, your loving arms to hold them.

Some of them are scared.

Some are full of anxiousness.

I hear daily of depression, unfulfilled lives and souls that are deeply troubled.

I know many who battle addictions to drugs and alcohol

Families are torn apart by divorce or parents who didn't bother to even marry.

I hear of brokenness.

I hear of not having purpose and direction.



Help me to listen, dearest Lord.

You know my heart.

I am imperfect trying to comfort the grieving.

I weep for those who hurt.



The only answer I have is come to the Lord in prayer.

Bring your load and empty it.

There you will find rest and peace.

I intercede for those who need You,

Dearest Lord.



Amen

Mr. Governor, 

Needless to say, your call came as a bit of a surprise this morning...a 
pleasant one, but a 
surprise nonetheless.   I was walking to work in the newly fallen snow 
after dealing with a dead 
car battery, challenges that I will hopefully avoid in Tallahassee! 

So your call brightened an otherwise dreary morning.  It was an honor. 

I hope I did not put Secretary Agwanobi in an awkward position, as it 
was obvious that his 
staff had not had time to relay my phone calls of last evening to him or 
yourself.  I spoke to 
the HR director and incumbent Communications Director last night around 
8:00 p.m. 

I have nothing but respect for the Doctor and the great work his staff 
does for Florida at DOH. 
 I spent the day there last Friday and it was very obvious to me that 
they were a motivated, 
happy, and energized staff who believes in what they do and in their 
boss.  To an outsider with 
an eye for fabrication, it was obvious that their "spark" was genuine. 

As I said, the fit for me at State is better and I am pleased to be 
joining Secretary Hood's 
team on June 16th.  

I will bring the family by during the March 5-7 time frame for a 
courtesy call.  I will work 
with my chief-of-staff at DOS to see if there's a five-minute window in 
your schedule that week. 
  

I am being completely and totally honest when I say that the #1 dream 
job on my career 
transition plan was a spot on your team, sir.  After a 20-year career in 
the Navy, the thing I 
feared I'd miss the most was being part of something larger than myself 
and the sense of noble 
purpose.  This job at DOS gives me all that, and more.  

At the end of the day, I judge myself on one yardstick: Was I of any 
service to others today? 
I know I'll be able to say "yes" working in your administration.  You 
will not find another 
person with more "fire in their belly" than me, sir. 

I look forward to meeting you. 

Very respectfully, 
Bill Spann

For Bush, picking a No. 2 is full of risks
Gov. Jeb Bush could make history this week, just not the kind of history many in his Republican Party would like.

Sure, he could appoint Florida's first Hispanic lieutenant governor with state Rep. Gaston Cantens. Or the first female lieutenant governor with former Senate President Toni Jennings.

But conservatives fear that Bush is close to naming a No. 2 who supports abortion rights and campaigned for a tax increase.

Bush is expected to announce a replacement for Lt. Gov. Frank Brogan as early as Monday, just before the Legislature's annual regular session begins. The state Board of Governors will approve Brogan's new job Monday as president of Florida Atlantic University.

The lieutenant governor has just one official duty in the state Constitution -- taking over if the governor dies or resigns -- but Bush's decision could signal the heir of his massive political machine in anticipation of the 2006 governor's race.

The choice could haunt Bush, who is always aware of his brother's 2004 reelection campaign and his own potential presidential ambitions.

MODERATE REPUBLICAN

Jacksonville Mayor John Delaney has the backing of his city's business leaders, including several key Bush confidants and former business partners. But he also comes from the GOP's moderate wing, which does not support an abortion ban and views government as an ally, not an enemy.

Delaney is a popular mayor whose term ends in the spring, but he exhausted a great deal of political capital in the state GOP base for his passionate support of a penny sales tax increase in 2000 and his refusal to support Republican congressional candidate Jennifer Carroll over Democratic incumbent Corrine Brown.

A Lt. Gov. Delaney might have a hard time, for example, keeping a straight face arguing on behalf of his boss against raising taxes but in favor of slashing healthcare services to the poor.

On abortion, Delaney favors restrictions such as parental notice for minors and a ban on so-called partial-birth abortions -- the typical fallback for Democrats and moderate Republicans who oppose an all-out ban but fear being branded a liberal.

If Delaney is picked, said Carole Griffin, state vice president of the conservative Eagle Forum, ``I guess we'll have to continue praying that Jeb is able to continue his term in office.''

COURTING WOMEN

Some in Bush's inner circle want him to pick Jennings, a conservative from politically critical Central Florida.

Jennings is a good choice at a time when the GOP is trying to soften its image with women voters.

But there is some baggage.

As Senate president, Jennings was criticized for her unusually close relationship with Orlando lobbyist Oscar Juarez, whose list of corporate clients doing business with the Legislature expanded dramatically with his friend's power.

While insiders say that Jennings and Bush have gotten along well since she left the Senate in 2000, their relationship was testy at best when they were forced to work together. They are very different people whose personalities could clash again in close quarters.

A CUBAN AMERICAN

Cantens is said to be running third, but of the known finalists he could be the smartest pick.

While some worry about his lack of experience -- four years in the state House -- and his ability to operate on a statewide stage, the former prosecutor has good relationships with legislators in both parties and could help Bush navigate the session.

Many Republicans were impressed by his nearly successful bid last year to become speaker of the House. Some say Cantens could have gotten the votes if he were more savvy and hadn't been outworked by Rep. Allan Bense.

Cantens would become one of the best-positioned Cuban Americans in Florida for a statewide run in 2006 -- just as Republicans nationally are looking for prominent people to court increasingly important Hispanic voters.

A Lt. Gov. Cantens would also become a fascinating contender for Miami-Dade mayor, a Republican with an immediate statewide fundraising base and the ability to float above the ever-present local scandals and controversies that could complicate matters for other potential candidates.

In the end, Bush may surprise everyone by choosing someone not on the list that has made its way into print over the past few days.

Most are betting on Delaney, Jennings or Cantens -- in that order. Each would make history in his or her own way, and each would be a gamble for Bush.

Dear Gov. Jeb:    

For your consideration as you decide your choice for LG.. 
In October 2002 Rep Gaston Cantens was our guest speaker at the Old Cutler Republican Women's Club informing us about the Constitutional Amendments on the November ballot.  In a word, he was SUPERB.  He was extremely knowledgeable, well-spoken, respectful, well-dressed, charming.  And he was passionate about his conservative principles and his SUPPORT for YOU.  And he exhibited the spirit of a team player, mindful too of the cooperation necessary to translate those principles into legislation.  I have heard him speak a number of times over several years and I believe him to be a man of integrity and ethics.  He did not ask me to write and we are not personal friends, but I write because I think it important you know how he has acted when "no one was looking" and what it reveals of his character.  I think he would make the State of Florida proud.

Dear Senate President King: 

I am so disappointed in your appointment of Sen Wasserman Schultz to Vice Chair of Appropriations.  She has and continues to show herself as a bitter Democrat partisan.  During the run-up to the November 2002 elections, a friend of mine attended a nearby Democrat Power meeting at which the Senator spoke with vitriol and hatred towards our Gov Bush.  It was not just politics, but personal and destructive commentary.  Most recently she was quoted in the Miami Herald attacking Gov Bush regarding his budget, "First it's Sept. 11, and then Amendment 9 and now the war.  Why isn't it ever his fault?  It's always something else, never bad decision making."  I fail to see how these comments are constructive to resolving the impending budget crisis.  And they are personal.  It escapes me to understand why you would give power to someone so anti-Republican, anti-Bush.  She presents herself as happiest when Republicans fail and I fail to see what she will contribute to a Republican agenda for Florida.  Certainly there are other capable and contributing Democrats in the Senate interested in Florida first.  I for one would urge you to reconsider this appointment. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yea...I wondered about that.  (You sound like a correspondent for Jeb) but let me ask you something else.
 
Jeb knows me and how far I've gone to get the Sexual Predator (aka "luring law") on the books, and the "State's position on it's current problems trying to repeal the law based on an isolated case law case in Miami Dade County area.  Jeb said that it's was going to be overturned (I can't remember if that were his exact words or not) but "not to worry".
 
Again...I MUST worry.  Governor's don't have THAT much power. I know from my days working so closely with Lawton over a little girl's case that involved a military base, and therefore, she was unprotected based on UCC laws.
 
Is there anything I should be preparing to do?  Working with Sen.. Christ, or making a journey up to Tallahassee or getting a petition together to do same?
 
Isolated case law can throw the baby out with the bath water.
 
I doing a speech on this March 6th so it's timely to ask.
 
Also, what else the "State of Florida" should be HIGHLY CONCERNED about is the EXTREME budget cuts for the children in this state as I am reading in the newspapers and how that means that DFC will be bombarded with more cases with even less money to stretch to accommodate to this State-wide disaster.  If you don't have a good counseling program (for instance) for troubled children...guess what? They grow up into troubled adults, rebel, hang out with characters of like-kind and become criminals that KILL people because after all...no one cared about them?  That's just the way they think.  I know.  I was a victim of crime from an early age, and foster homes for most of my early teens until I got married to get out of being the "Property of the State of Florida".  I was lucky.   I put myself through college and made something of myself, but I probably couldn't have done all that without PAID FOR COUNSELING provided by the State that certainly helped me see myself as a person who had potential.
 
Please, reconsider this budget cut!!!!
 
And tell me what I can do (of if I have to do) to bring up the issue of leaving the Sexual Predator Registration ACT on the books and NOT letting the judges be the "judge" of who is dangerous and who is not!  I've got case studies from not only Florida but various other states to show why THAT is preposterous.

Subject:	Consideration

I wonder why a luxury tax on alcohol is so legislatively repulsive:

Underage and adult excessive drinking account for half of the alcohol beverage industry's sales -- $56.9 billion of the total $116.2 billion Americans spend on alcohol each year -- according <http://www.jointogether.org/sa/news/alerts/reader/0,1854,561887,00.html>  to an analysis by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) at Columbia University, published in the February 26th issue <http://jama.ama-assn.org/issues/v289n8/rfull/joc22321.html>  of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). 

The study, which analyzed three national data sources, reports that excessive drinking by adults constitutes 30 percent of all alcohol consumed in the U.S., with underage drinking accounting for an additional 20 percent. 

Public health experts concur that alcohol -- in the form of underage and excessive drinking -- is by far the nation's number one drug problem, inflicting massive economic, social and health burdens on society. But Califano, in a joint statement with former First Lady Betty Ford, charged that alcohol producers have long tried to play this down.

"The alcohol industry has consistently underestimated the cost of underage and excessive drinking in the U.S. and this JAMA study gives the American people the facts for the first time," said Mrs. Ford and Califano. "This JAMA article makes clear that alcohol is a premier drug of abuse in America," Califano added.

Join Together's David Rosenbloom, director of Join Together, a project of the Boston University School of Public Health, says that successful efforts to reduce excessive adult drinking and underage consumption fall into three general categories.

"First, raise taxes. We know that raising the price of alcohol is effective in decreasing consumption, especially underage drinking." Because excise taxes haven't kept up with inflation, it's actually much cheaper to buy alcohol now than it was 30 years ago, he notes. Alcohol taxes can have an additional benefit: funding prevention and treatment programs.

With states facing severe budget shortfalls, advocates for raising alcohol taxes, like the Center for Science in the Public Interest <http://www.cspinet.org/booze/taxguide/TaxIndex.htm> , think the timing is right for progress. Some states, like Alaska <http://www.jointogether.org/sa/news/summaries/reader/0,1854,554812,00.html>  and Arizona, have already done so; others are pondering the move, though not without vociferous opposition from the alcohol industry. The beer industry, for example, is aggressively lobbying Congress for a nationwide beer tax rollback <http://capwiz.com/jto/issues/alert/?alertid=136663> .


Unfortunately, it appears progressive thinking regarding attacking the abuse of alcohol will be passed over this legislative session again.

March 2, 2003



Dear Governor Bush,

As a Registered Nurse with 22 years of experience, I am distressed by the
impending loss of our Level 1 Trauma Center.  What a devastation to a
community who services an international airport and a huge tourist industry.

With paramedics and air ambulance personnel already paralyzed by our
overcrowded facility,  I wonder who now will be free to transport trauma
patients 80 miles down the road to the closest Level 1 Trauma Center?   When
Neurosurgeons leave our facility because they can no longer afford the
liability and insurance premiums,  Neurosurgeons still practicing in Level 1
Trauma Centers elsewhere will begin to leave as well.  There is no possible
way that an already overburdened medical system, anywhere in Florida, can
take on or afford to take on any more Level 1 Trauma and the liability.

As a parent you will understand when I worry how someone  I love,  who needs
Level 1Trauma Care, is possibly going to get to a facility in time when
seconds count.  As we watch trauma victims  evacuated by scarce resources,
it will become the most incredible 40-80min hoping and praying that once
they arrive at the next Trauma Center there is a physician available to care
for them.

I was encouraged to write to you by our mutual friend, Bill Bucknam. I urge
you to take the lead in assisting to reduce insurance premiums and limiting
jury awards.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Teresa J. Loomis RN, BSN

Subject: homelessness




Governor:
I know that it is unusual to have me supporting something other than professional liability reform.  
 
I am Chairman of the Program Service Committee of the Broward Partnership for the Homeless.  Four years ago we instituted a "Benchmark" program to intervene in our clients lives by providing intensive behavioral health intervention.  We soon learned that the only way to "cure" homelessness is by modifying our patient's aberrant life-styles, and treating their alcohol and addiction  problems. 
 
Our research found that 42% of our residents were "dual diagnosed" with mental health disorders and alcohol/substance abuse problems. Fully 82% of our population had alcohol/substance abuse issues.  Henderson and BARC do not provide anywhere near the level of support that these people require.  Out of 1517 residents, we were able to place only 145 in Henderson and 449 in BARC.  The other 800 were treated by our in-house psychiatrist and staff.
 
 We have been enormously successful:  
1. last year, 759 of our residents were placed in transitional or permanent housing.
2. at three months, 100% of a sample population remained on their medications,
3. 60% remained employed;
slightly less than half were on disability
4. only 8 of 59 were homeless again, three months following their discharge.
 
There is ample data to show that for each dollar invested at the front end, government can save $10 on the back end.  Consider that Sheriff Ken Jenne performs 572 mental health evaluations per month!  18% of Broward's inmate population suffers mental illness.  This costs the taxpayers of Broward County $125 per day (vs. $78 for the normal inmate population.)  
The Broward Partnership for the Homeless is able to provide housing, food, and behavioral health/substance abuse intervention for around $50 per day.
 
However, less than half of our revenue come from the county.  We depend on other sources of revenue.  Heretofore, Florida has been very generous providing $250,000 per year to enable us to provide these behavioral health interventions.  It is critical that we continue to receive this grant.  100% of these dollars are spent on mental health.
 
Please provide your support for the continuation of this grant.  Rep. Mack has submitted this grant proposal and it has been assigned a tracking number #1420.
 
Should there be the feeling that this grant "only" benefits Broward residents, realize that homelessness respects no geographic boundaries.  
 
Thank you for your anticipated support of this grant submission.

Jeb doing a good job
    I thank Gov. Jeb Bush for the way he is handling the budget crisis. At 
my house, when a crisis occurs, sometimes savings that have been earmarked 
for one project might need to go toward the immediate problem. Gov. Bush 
warned the state of Florida what would happen if people voted for reduced 
class sizes and so forth. I'm glad he has decided not to raise taxes.
     My husband and I are tired of working hard, just to have so much taken 
out in taxes to fund those who sit back and think the government owes them 
because they are part of a special-interest group. I home-school my two 
children, Tyler, 15, and Savannah, 11; and in our home we teach, if you 
don't have the money to buy, do without. If you have an emergency, pay out 
of savings.
     This is what Gov. Bush is doing, and this middle-income family thanks 
him for staying out of our pockets as he goes through the frustrating task 
of balancing the budget! We realize that there may come a time to raise 
taxes, but it's good to know that our governor is trying to do all that he 
can do without going that route.
    Since we can't shake Gov. Bush's hand, we would like to send him a big 
thanks for the great job he is doing in such a diverse state as Florida!

  Trust-fund burden
     I read with great interest the story by staff writer Dinah Voyles 
Pulver ("The Governor's Hit List: State's trust funds in jeopardy," Feb. 
25).
      I was unaware that our state had 450 trust funds set up for various 
reasons. I was further unaware that 58 percent of the state budget goes to 
these trust funds every year. Although I am sure some of these funds have a 
viable and legitimate purpose, 450 seems a bit extreme. I was further 
intrigued by the fact that these trust funds have $3.9 billion in cash 
reserves as of 2002.
     I must take exception to the heading of the article, "The Governor's 
Hit List." These trust funds are not on a hit list.
     Residents should demand that our elected leaders review these items. We 
are in this tight situation for many reasons, part of which may be that 58 
percent of the annual budget is tied to these trust funds.
     The addition of constitutional amendments for the high speed rail and 
the reduced class size also impacts the budget. When we as voters fail to 
fully understand the ramifications of what we are voting for, this is the 
result. Money must be found to pay for these projects as they are voter 
mandated. When we do not educate ourselves as to the consequences of our 
vote, how can we complain when it is we the voters who created the 
situation?
     Perhaps it is time to do away with all special-interest trust funds and 
assign a priority to each and put all the money back into the general 
budget.

Dear Governor Bush,

This week the SAC (State Advisory Committee), and the FDDC (Florida 
Developmental Disabilities Council) met and I had the opportunity to share my 
excitement and enthusiasm regarding Web-Based Assessment.  Mary Laura 
Openshaw, Director of your Just Read Florida Program, gave a presentation to 
the SAC on Tuesday and detailed Florida's leadership in the implementation of 
NCLB. 

It is a VERY exciting time right now, and having Florida lead the way makes 
me very proud to be involved in your initiative to bring Web-based Assessment 
to our ESE population first!  My Michael and I are looking forward to meeting 
with Vantage, NCEO (National Center on Educational Options), and leaders of 
the ATIA  (Assistive Technology Industry Association) to discuss the message 
that we would like to move across the country. 

Vantage met with Secretary Paige the week before last (braving the blizzard!) 
and really hit a home run in terms of how policy makers view Web-based 
Assessment as a way to meet the requirements of NCLB.  Secretary Paige also 
saw how Vantage is providing more efficient ways to administer, score and 
report assessment results.  They offer SOLUTIONS!

It would be excellent if you could join us at a meeting with Secretary Paige 
to demonstrate not only your commitment to NCLB, but your shared commitment 
to students with disabilities in the state of Florida.  Your leadership has 
moved Florida into the forefront, but this country needs to see that when 
Florida says NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND, we mean it...and our students with 
disabilities are NOT being left behind, but are leading the way!

I will always appreciate your leadership, but your advocacy is appreciated 
even more.  Thank you, and please let me know if your schedule permits 
meeting with the Secretary.  I remain,

From the Heart,

Karen

DCF is in the process of adding reading corners or rooms to areas where
parents wait with children. This waiting time can become quality time with
their children and they are encouraged to take the books home. Suzanne is
the Broward Community Resources Manager. Initially there was concern that
parents or children would steal the books. I can only pray that we are so
successful that that happens!

This is officially off the ground in our South and Central ESS offices.  We
have books from the school board coming in monthly and we are starting a
book drive within the district to allow staff to donate books as well.  I
am in the process of getting tables and chairs and book shelves for
toddlers donated for the service centers.  The parents waiting in our
centers are enjoying this and are starting to read to their children
instead of using volunteers which are hard to recruit on an on-going basis.
It seems to be working out well.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
	I am honored to recommend Clay Simmons to you as a Judicial Candidate for Seminole County Circuit Court, in the 18th Judicial Circuit.  
 
Clay has practiced law in the same firm in Seminole County for the last 22 years.  He has helped groom that firm into the largest full-service law firm in Seminole County.  Clay is greatly respected by the judiciary, the legal community and by the business community.  

Clay is the consummate professional.  He is hard working, smart, always prepared, and tough.  But, these qualities are always tempered by his dignity and his respect for his fellow man.  In other words, he has the perfect temperament to be a judge.     

Clay also has the experience that is necessary to be a great judge.  He has represented individuals, businesses, cities, Seminole Community College, Seminole County Sheriff's Department, and the school board.  He has tried many cases, and knows his way around the courtroom.  His broad range of experience would be invaluable on the bench.  

Finally, Clay and I just completed an intensive Bible study together.  This was a wonderful opportunity to get to know Clay even better.  I can tell you without reservation that Clay would make a wonderful judge.

Ph:(850) 523-0688  Fax:  (850) 523-0745

 

March 3, 2003

 

Dear Dr. Bowman,

 

Thank-you for your lengthy four page response to The Coalition of McKay Scholarship Schools’ questions to Governor Bush concerning the McKay Scholarship program and our problems in communicating with your office and DOE.  Unfortunately, your response reminds me of George Bernard Shaw’s statement “The problem with communication is the illusion that it has been accomplished.”  

 

The Choice Office held a stakeholders’ meeting on February 17th which most of the board of The Coalition were able to attend.  Your letter stated that we knew of the meeting prior to our letter being sent. This was not the case.  In fact, we heard of the meeting through another private school administrator and I took it upon myself to call The Choice Office to find out about the meeting.  The only way that our board members heard of the meeting was through my contacts to them.  Many of the other stakeholders told us, at the meeting, that they had less than a week’s notice of the meeting.  

 

The stakeholders meeting answered two of the four questions we sent to the governor.  1) There are no longer advisory boards being developed but stakeholders meetings will be held.  The group did suggest to Dr. Metty that these meetings be held three times a year, publicized well in advance, and moved around the state so that more stakeholders could participate.  2)  The second question answered was that the DOE is making no suggestions for legislative changes concerning the McKay Scholarship Program and will not support any changes to the program.  Unfortunately, we know there are legislative efforts to attack the McKay Scholarship Program.  We trust that there are no DOE staff members encouraging these efforts and you will keep abreast of the situation.

 

Our major questions remain unanswered.  On February 7th, when The Coalition received your letter, you assured us that the questions regarding services for unilaterally placed students in private schools would be answered by MS. Shan Goff’s office within ten days.  It is now March 3rd and I wanted you to be aware that we have received no answer to the questions we have asked since October 4th.

 

We have continued to ask  for a definition of active vs. inactive IEP.  If a student is not enrolled in a public school in the summer, could a district say they did not have an active IEP?   A definition and an answer would be appreciated.  To reply, as you did, that this was addressed in a “technical assistance document” is not an answer; it is a bureaucratic response.  Dr. Metty said at the February 17 stakeholders meeting that he would address in writing the issue of “inactive vs active IEP’s”. We have not received this answer at this time.

 

Dr. Bowman, these are not trick questions.  The Coalition and the schools that it represent have, and will continue to have, legitimate questions which we will continue to ask for answers.  As taxpayers and voters, and intelligent persons, we expect to have legitimate replies not bureaucratic responses.

 

Sincerely,

 

 

Robyn A. Rennick, MS

Subject:	Destination Florida Commission - Final Report

Dear Chairman T. O'Neal Douglas, dear Secretary Terry White,
 
I have read your final report and as you have seen in the St.Petersburg Times, already commented on it. So did you!

I think the main concern of many citizens familiar with the issues is not the fact that you are trying to get the migration flowing again and suggest to advertise for it aggressively. It's more the fact that the committee has been approached by many concerned citizens asking to improve the existing living conditions before starting the advertising campaign. You have heard during the public comments about the problems many retirees encounter in Florida. While other States are trying to improve conditions for retirees, Florida has so far failed to address many main issues. Business sense tells us that Florida can only stay competitive if we can advertise with improved conditions, not with just empty advertising. 
Please note that these comments are not meant to criticize your efforts, but increase the effectiveness of the outcome of the lengthy deliberations of your Commission.
Please read my final comments at our WebPages at :
http://www.ccfj.net/DestFledfincomment.html
Many concerned citizens feel that an approach of improvement before advertising would be more promising. 
This is just some food for thought, but should possibly be considered by our legislators before committing money for advertising campaigns.
Many of these improvements are possible without committing big tax dollars but would make the planned advertising campaign definitely more effective!
Thank you for listening to my concerns!
 
Warm regards

All I ask for is Kinder through 3rd grade (K-3rd). This is where I think children would mostly benefit from such intervention as caping class-size. However, let me stress that his whole issue is a very dangerous fervor. If not handled properly it will be very damaging. The children are in the hearts of everyone and I believe even the divine are perplexed so to ease the pain at least K-3rd should be on the ballot. I don't believe this is something you can disappoint the will of the spirit.

Dear Ms. Rodriguez:

This letter is on behalf of Clay Simmons, a Sanford attorney who is being 
considered for the position of Circuit Court Judge in Seminole County. Clay 
tells me the Nominating Committee has indicated his application has made the 
short list of candidates.

I have known clay, primarily in a professional capacity, since about 1990. My 
previous personal attorney recommended him to me in a divorce proceeding. He 
represented me in that regard and in several other smaller matters since then.

I have found him professionally adept and, at the same time, the kind of man 
who takes a personal interest in his clients and their situations. Clay 
counseled with both my ex-wife and I in the beginning of the divorce, Later, 
that was very helpful in reaching a fair and amiable solution to our 
relationship.

As a reporter who has regular dealings with attorneys and judges, I believe 
Clay has many of the best qualities of the men and women I respect in the 
legal area. Clay is a family man who has participated widely in the community 
in a number of ways that have been beneficial. He is a devoted family man. I 
believe he has the knowledge and experience, combined with a perspective that 
mirrors his background as a common, working man, to be an excellent judicial

Good evening, Governor,

Ed Easton from the Miami-Dade school oversight board testified before the
K-20 Education subcommittee today, essentially saying that the district is
so dysfunctional that it can't fix itself. He would like to see an
independent board of some kind be given direct authority over land purchase,
construction and maintenance operations. 

He did not want to specifically suggest what format it would take, but it
seems clear that such a change would require a new law. Is this something
you would be open to supporting in the Legislature and signing if it came
across your desk?

Thanks in advance, and best wishes,

My students are Special education high schoolers. They are learning pre-algebra. Since the FCATS the kids are finally coming into high school with some skills. Previously ESE students entering our high school could not even identify the parts of a fraction or divide (they often could add and multiply, but not even subtract reliably). For the first time, they at least recognize these concepts and know how to perform them in general.

The FCATS are making teachers look at what they present and STRIVE to present it, or fail; as they used to say: "The proof is in the pudding." My students often make 30-100 point gains because I have to teach them THINKING skills now. I applaud your boldness. Something had to be done. I have been a teacher for over 30 years, and originally we prepared students for YEARLY Regents exams in EVERY academic subject (In NY). Failures repeated the class, even if they had A's, because who could really say what an A in Mr So and So's class means.  

This is a positive step to ensure that no child will be left behind. Do NOT give up, do NOT give in. Give us MORE. Our goal is not to make kids happy or even to make parents happy. Our goal is to give PEOPLE skills they need to be good, productive citizens of our country. Anything less is wasted effort, and cannot be justified under the United States Consitution, which promotes education under the aegis of  "good for the common welfare" clause.

Subject: Frances Odum Turns 50

Dear Jeb,
 
I hope this letter finds you doing well.  Marty fills me in on the latest happenings in Tallahassee and around the state.
 
On March 21st Frances will turn 50.  In my efforts to make this a special birthday celebration for her I am producing a "Happy 50th Birthday, Frances" video.  I'm under the impression Marty has already spoken to you about this.  In any event, I have been doing this as a hobby for about two years, and if I do say so myself, I'm getting pretty good at it.  It will be set to music and full of fancy editing, baby pictures, nostalgic photos and on camera birthday wishes from her friends.  She would be thrilled, as would I, if you would do a short birthday greeting to her.
 
The video is intended to be funny, rather than serious.  Most of the comments so far center on the theme "Gee Frances, you don't look 50", or "I can't believe you're 50", and include a line or two of happy birthday greetings, and/or a personal message.  A typical greeting is generally between thirty to sixty seconds, but since you are the Governor you can take as much time as you'd like.
 
Please let me know if you would be willing to do this.  I don't think it would take more than five to ten minutes to tape your greeting, and it would be very special to have you be a part of this memorabilia.  
 
Thank you very much,
 
W. Guy Odum, Jr.
 
P.S.  This is a surprise which requires some creative measures be taken in communicating about this.  Without being presumptuous, if you e-mail me, please e-mail my Assistant, Tammy LeMaster at tammy@tourturf.com.  If you have somebody call me, please make sure they don't say that it's about the video in case Frances answers.  My number is (904) 285-3097.

Subject: Thank you & Update on Our Situation (Space Adventures in Florida)

Dear Governor Bush: 

I wanted to thank you for your letter of January 14th, 2003 in support of our effort to open up commercial human space flight, space flight training, and space tourism in the United States, and specifically in the state of Florida. 

We -- Space Adventures (www.spaceadventures.com) -- are the company that arranges for private citizens to fly in space. For example, you have probably heard about us with regard to our work with NASA and the Russian Space Agency to fly people like Dennis Tito and Mark Shuttleworth to the International Space Station for about $20,000,000 each. We have so far done the two flights of these type, but we have several more clients who would like to go. This type of thing is especially important in the wake of Columbia as every time we do this it really helps the public awareness for space, educates people, gets the general public enthusiastic about space exploration, and provides valuable cash to help the Russians subsidize their costs in servicing the space station -- especially important while the Shuttle fleet is grounded.

Additionally, we are developing a remarkable new space flight program that will really open this kind of thing up to a lot more people, and that will lead to small spaceplanes being used for actual transportation on Earth - like flying from Miami to London in 30 minutes. It's called sub-orbital flight and currently we are working with some of the best aerospace companies in the country to make it happen; companies like XCOR Aerospace (whose new space system was on the cover of Popular Science as one of the inventions of the year in 2002). 

We can think of no better place to begin operating these vehicles than in Florida, the center of America's space operations and the country's top tourist destination all in one!  Anyway, we still need your help. In addition to investing tens and hundreds of millions of dollars to develop commercial space flight itself, we are developing and implementing various space flight orientation and training programs that people can participate in right now. The most important of those programs right now is our F-104 Starfighter "astronaut orientation" program that is all ready to go, with one exception ..... we are still delayed in our final FAA approvals. That's why you wrote your letter of support to the FAA on our behalf back in January, and that's what I am asking for your help again now. 

If you could call FAA Administrator Marion Blakey (her number is (202) 267-3111) and reassert your support for our endeavors, I beleive it would help speed things up for us, and get this economic activity "off the ground". 

Right now all of this "space tourism" activity goes on overseas. This is an unbelievable shame, and something Space Adventures is working to change. We want Florida to be the center of space tourism, not Moscow!!! The space flight training and space flight orientation role of the F-104 is vital with regard to the realization of all of the above endeavors, which is why the FAA's positive and timely response to our requested exemption is so important to the country.

I will be happy to provide you or your staff with any more information about this process should you require it. My contact information is below.

Most Sincerely,

Subject: Recommendation Of Clay Simmons; Circuit Court; Eighteenth Judicial Circuit


March 3, 2003

 

The Honorable Jeb Bush

Governor of the State of Florida

 

Dear Governor Bush:

 

The purpose of this letter is to express my support for the appointment of Clay Simmons to the position of Circuit Court Judge in and for the Eighteenth Judicial Circuit Court. I know that you are receiving many letters of support, but I hope that my views might present you with a unique insight into Mr. Simmons.

 

I was originally going to lead off this letter with a litany of the outstanding legal ability of Mr. Simmons.  I was not going to go into the area that I am about to start off with.  But, the news story about the female college basketball player from New York who turns her back on the American Flag when the National Anthem is played before games resulted in my starting out this letter on a different foundation.  Thus, my comments about my view of Mr. Simmons as a practicing lawyer over the past 20 years will have to wait for a minute.

 

Clay Simmons in not just a top-notch lawyer who is well respected by all who know him in the legal community. He is a man who put career success in jeopardy by continuing to faithfully serve his County in the United States Air Force Reserve after leaving active duty.  He is now a retired Lieutenant Colonel.  This achievement came with no little sacrifice.  I know of the pressures that he faced in remaining faithful to his family and law practice while continuing to serve his Nation in the United States Air Force Reserve. I know of the pressures that he faced when he still took on community service as he served on City of Lake Mary boards and committees such as the Planning and Zoning Commission while still fulfilling his obligations in the Air Force.  I know of the pressures that he faced when he continued to teach as an adjunct professor at Seminole Community College to help support his family while also being a student himself in the schools that the Air Force required that he complete while also serving his annual stint as an active member of the Air Force.  Mr. Simmons could have rested on his active duty service in Vietnam and ended his service to Country upon discharge after that War, but he did not.  Although I was an Army JAG officer myself, my father was a Lieutenant Colonel in the Air Force and I know full well the pressures of that position. That achievement demonstrates to me that he will be faithful to the appointment if you appoint him to the Circuit Court bench.  

 

Aside from success in military service, Mr. Simmons is, as I stated earlier, a very skilled attorney. I have litigated against him and with him. His integrity is unquestionable from both points of view.  Aside from just being a litigator, Mr. Simmons maintains an active office practice as a legal counselor. He interacts very well with people. He is a gentleman in the practice of law, but also a zealous proponent for the views of his clients.  He has sought out public service. He has served as City Attorney for the City of Lake Mary, College Attorney for Seminole Community College and has served as assistant School District Attorney as well as assistant city attorney for several Florida municipalities. He understands the private side of the law in terms of the business and enterprise that is so critical to a healthy economy. Likewise, he understands the function and limitations of government. He is well balanced in terms of comprehending private property rights while also appreciating the need for sound growth management and land use practices as well as the protection of the environment.  

 

Mr. Simmons is also a man of faith.  Although a person who respects the views and beliefs of others, Mr. Simmons acknowledges a faith in God and a dependency upon his Christian foundational core values.  I have seen him advocate, with equal zeal and commitment, the cause of a corporation with abundant financial resources in a commercial matter and the cause of a not well-to-do African American in a case that had much personal meaning to the client.  He loves his family and genuinely enjoys seeing the happiness of other families.

 

In short, Clay Simmons would bring to the Circuit Court a well-rounded person who understands the need to serve his fellow man, the need to ensure that high ethical standards are maintained, and, moreover, understands the fact that public service requires sacrifice and dedication.  He has served his Nation well, he has served his community well, and, upon your appointing him to the Circuit Court, he will continue to serve his profession with honor.  

 

Clay Simmons is someone who you will not regret appointing to a position of trust. He is a person with whom I believe you would share a commonality of values.  I was blessed with your appointing me to the Seventh Judicial Circuit Court Judicial Nominating Commission.  At the training session that I attended after appointment you addressed us and expressed your vision for the bench.  Clay Simmons would help bring to fruition your vision of the Florida judiciary.

 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. (I will follow up this e-mail with a letter on letterhead for the records of your office).  

 

Respectfully,

I watch my step in certain circles (political correctness appropriate for the environment) but in others have had the pleasure of offering insight to the need for the FCAT.  As a dividend volunteer and PTA executive board member I often have the chance to "turn" either a parent or education employee as to the need to return to the basics that so many children have been robbed of.  
A teacher that I volunteer with was an immigrant as a child and tells how she learned by the "sink or swim" theory as did everyone whom came to America some time ago.
Her story is interesting as I too have friends whom immigrated from Cuba and had to learn the "hard" way.  Why is it that when one is asked to be diligent and "work" towards a goal it is viewed as an extreme measure?
Thank you for your goals for our children.

Mr. Bush,

 

Thank you for taking the time from your busy day to read my email. 

 

I am writing you in regards to a situation that you no-doubt are aware of; the passing of our Bay County Property Appraiser Mr. Davis. With the passing of Mr. Davis, it is my understanding that the decision for appointment of a new Appraiser would be left up to your office.

 

I would like to recognize my support for Mr. Rick Barnett. I’ve come to know Rick over the last 4 years. We were actually candidates for separate elections back during the 2000 races. At that time Rick was the only opponent against Mr. Davis for the office. Though Rick lost that race by a narrow margin he continued the education and certification for becoming a certified property appraiser.

 

All over Bay County you can find properties that are still taxed on 5, 10, even 20 year old assessments of the property. This not only places a dent in the monies collected for tax roles but also deprives our school system of needed Millage funds that are tied to property taxes.

 

I truly believe that Rick Barnett has proven his desire and determination for this office and his commitment for improving our current system that needs work to ensure that we all are paying “Our fair share” of the taxes in Bay County.  This office needs new blood; it needs someone with new ideas, and someone that is not tied to special interests or developers and being that he is a good republican doesn’t hurt either. 

 

Rick is that man.

 

Thank you again for your time,

 

Should you have questions or need to contact me I have included my numbers below.

This is how all those telesales,marketing , etc. , can obtain your Tel #
even if you are not listed. In some cases they are calling from out of
florida , and feel they are not subject to the "Department of Agriculture
$10.oo "No Call List' It does go to only $ 5.oo per year after the first
year to stay listed , but it requires a lot of effort to file a complaint ,
fill out the form , and it requires quite a few complaints on the same
tele-whatever company for the Dept. of Agriculture to act in a punitive
manner .
What a State we live in ! I just found out the Pinellas County DMV owes me
refunds of Fifty dollers for the Handicap tags they charged me for at $15.oo
per , except the one I did over the Telephone with charge card , as I was
too ill to go to the DMV and pick it up.Actually , it may have been the
office of the tax collector , which is in the same building.
Does anyone know the new BATFE fee for Class B new requirments to pay for
all those E's they have to add on to BATF ?

Jeb:

Entre hoy y mañana todos los ojos van a estar puestos en tí en tu
selcción del L.G. y en tu discurso a los legisladores sobre el proyecto
de las clases.

Yo creo que en la selección del L.G. debes escoger una persona que
sobretodo sea leal a tí. No cedas a presiones y pongas a una persona que
va a estar en contra tuya, haciéndote la guerra todo el tiempo. En estos
cuatro años, tú  necesitas a alguien en quién confiar y que te alivie en
tu trabajo en lugar de crearte conflictos.

En lo que respecta a la legislatura, la mejor forma de salir de este
problema del tamaño de las clases, es presentar una visión donde se
utilicen los recursos existentes en la comunidad sin tener que crear
nuevas estructuras físicas.  En vez de tú decir qué hacer, pídele a los
legisladores que sean creativos y encuentren soluciones prácticas para
solucionar el problema sin derrochar dinero. Pónles a ellos la
responsabildad de sin tener que añadir nuevos impuestos, presenten
soluciones factibles.

Por ejemplo, ellos pueden sugerir la utilización máxima de las esucelas
con horarios dobles, escuelas abiertas todo el año, mejor distribución
del espacio. (En las escuelas existentes, hay muchos espacios sin usar
que almacenan computadoras en vez de ponerlas en las aulas de clase).
También en nuestras comunidades, hay muchos edificios vacíos que
pertenecen a la ciudad o de negocios y organizaciones que pueden ser
utilizados como escuelas comunitarias.

Lo más importante es que vean en tí un hombre con visión que sabe cómo
responder a momentos de crisis de una manera responsable y que no vas a
presentar un plan dudoso como tus enemigos esperan que hagas.

Que Dios te bendiga,

Arnhilda

Dear Voice.....
 
Having worked with Toni Jennings on State legislative matters and knowing her personally, I think the Governor's choice of her as our new Lieutenant Governor, is a very good appointment.  
 
As a State House Member, and later President of the Florida Senate, Lt. Gov. Jennings, is a moderate who knows Florida well. She brings a history of seeking balance between economic opportunities and conservation of our natural resources. 
 
Hopefully her past support and appreciation of the University of Florida and Shands will continue in her new position of influence.  Coming from a business background, Jennings knows that what is good for education at all levels, is good for business. We should all welcome her return to public service.

Thank you for your attention.

Governor Jeb Bush
The Capitol
Tallahassee, Florida 32399-0001

Dear Governor Bush:

I know you are a very compassionate man and care about the developmentally disabled. This is why I am writing in behalf of my son Andrew, since he is not able to speak for himself.  Andrew is 32 years old and has autism.  

Andrew is classic autistic, very trainable with splinter skills, but has a communication and language disorder that causes social and behavior problems.  When he is not with people that understand his disorder, he becomes anxious and his unsocial behavior increases.

When he was in the Broward County schools, he was in a program that understood autism.  They trained him and taught him many skills to use when graduated from school.  He is now out of school for ten years, and there are no community programs that fit his needs.  He keeps getting suspended from the programs that are for the developmentally disabled individuals that do not have behavior problems.  

We have had behaviorists write up plans that work well for Andrew, and the staff at the programs never looked at the plans.  They do not want to be bothered.  When you use techniques that prevent anxiety, Andrew has no problems.  Because these programs have no staff trained in autism, they keep changing his classrooms, and that causes anxiety. Then his behavior becomes bizarre, and he does strange things that he never did before.

Each developmentally disabled person needs to be in a program suited for his or her needs.  The goal is supported employment or community volunteerism.  Andrew should give back to the community that assists him, and not sit in a babysitting program with individuals that don't understand his disorder. The programs he has been in are for individuals that are not capable of doing work.  He needs guidance and a support coach to keep him on task.  

The reason I am writing is because there are no programs for adults with autism in Broward County, although the programs say they are for the developmentally disabled.  Autism is considered a developmental disability, and all programs in Broward County for the developmentally disabled should include staff trained in autism, a behaviorist and coaches for supported employment or community volunteerism.

Within recent years there has been an increase of children with autism.  What are you going to do with these children when they become adults, when you can't help one individual with autism?  

Looking forward to a reply, since Andrew needs a program suited to his needs as soon as possible.

Sincerely,

Dear Governor,

 

I have a serious question for you to answer,

 

How can it be that an office supply company in Tallahassee can be the priority contract with the city and the state offices, when 1) the owner may be a female, but does not hire African Americans, Hispanics, or any other nationality on the sales force because they don’t speak English she says and has told me so.

 

2) the owner only hires African Americans to deliver supplies and work in the warehouse.

 

3 ) her husband is a known abuser of words that describe all the above and will not hire African  Americans at his company.

 

I would like to know how in depth the committee’s check these companies before they award these contracts.

 

Please respond.

Her grandmother had a hip operation and is in a rehab hospital.  She has had all the patients praying for Caity and the FCAT test.  Some of them aren't too sure what it is, but they are praying for her anyway.  Did you remember???? Thank you........Marianne Bryant and Caity.

PRE-KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM, SHORT $500,000, IN PERIL


 BARTOW -- Already faced with a $4 million budget shortfall, the Polk County School Board is not sure it can continue to support a countywide pre-kindergarten program that is $500,000 in the hole.

 The Polk County School Readiness Coalition told board members this week that the program is a half million short due to changes in the state funding formula.

 Coalition representatives are looking to school officials to make up the deficit, which would cause the district's shortfall to jump to $4.5 million.

Governor –

 

I believe that you are meeting with Sheriff Tunnell on Thursday. I just wanted to remind you that this is the follow-up meeting from the time that you were interviewing potential agency head candidates. The Sheriff expressed interest in DOC just as you were selecting Sec. Crosby. Because the Sheriff was on vacation and never had a face to face conversation with you, this week’s meeting was scheduled to allow for you to thank him for his earlier interest and discuss whether there may be areas in which he is interested in serving.

 

Great pick and announcement Monday.

Jeb,

 

I am chairing the National Kidney Foundation of Florida Event being held on the 3rd Floor of the Capitol Rotunda today, October 4th, between 10AM and 3PM.  It is a free health screening and awareness program that the Foundation conducts throughout the State.  This program has assisted thousand of Floridians in detecting if they are at risk for kidney disease and providing prevention information.

Statistics show that more than one million adult Floridians have chronic kidney disease and another 1.2 million are at risk. Most are not even aware of this potential health threat. During March, National Kidney Month, the National Kidney Foundation encourages all Floridians, especially those at risk, to get tested for kidney disease.

While anyone can develop chronic kidney disease, some individuals have an increased propensity than others to develop it. Individuals in high-risk groups include:

*	Diabetics or those with a family history of diabetes 

*	Those with high blood pressure or family history of hypertension 

*	Those with a family history of chronic kidney disease 

*	African-Americans, Hispanics, Pacific Islanders and Native Americans 

Chronic kidney disease usually causes no symptoms until it reaches an advanced stage, but simple tests can be done to detect kidney disease early. If caught early enough, chronic kidney disease can be treated to prolong or even prevent associated complicating factors, such as cardiovascular disease. 

Early detection not only saves lives, but also saves millions of dollars by reducing long-term health costs.

 

Jeb, I know with the opening of the session it is going to be busy and hectic.  Please stop by and say hello to the staff and volunteers.

 

Warmest friendly regards,

 

CJ

Hollywood's geopolitical geniuses 


The United States is on the brink of war with Iraq. As Saddam Hussein 
begins to brace for the whirlwind, he's got few 
weapons left. One of them is very predictable: Hollywood. 


A group called "Artists United to Win Without War" planned a "virtual 
march" on Washington for Feb. 26, an electric blitz of 
phone calls, faxes and e-mails calling for delay, delay, delay -- the 
complete set of Tariq Aziz talking points. 


But wait a minute. Just how can one take these "artists" seriously when 
they give themselves a name like that? Just how does 
one "win without war"? We accomplished zilch-o with U.N. "enforcement." 
Now we're going to "win" by giving in to more of 
the same. Kumbaya. 


To get the Hollywood campaign going, the "artists" put out 30-second TV 
ads featuring ... themselves. Martin Sheen, NBC's 
fake president, declares, "Don't invade Iraq ... Inspections work. War 
won't." The ad does not include a laugh track. In a 
different ad campaign, sour-pussed "comedian" Janeane Garofalo informs 
viewers of a U.N. estimate of half a million casualties 
"if we invade Iraq." She asks, "Do we have the right to do that to a 
country that's done nothing to us?" 


Celebrity Garofalo has been on news channels everywhere decrying how 
news channels only want to talk to celebrities instead 
of real experts. If only she had the decency to abide by her own 
argument and shut up! Hollywood plasters itself all over the 
public policy debate, and after being picked up by news media, then they 
slam the press for being shallow. 


They're right. 


As the Iraq threat grows more serious, these cultural ambassadors just 
get sillier. On last week's Sunday "news" shows, while 
NBC poked at an actual acid-flashback sixties retread, Rep. Dennis 
Kucinich, CBS and Fox sank into silliness by inviting on 
celebrity Iraq "experts." Can you imagine being one of the roughly 500 
members of Congress who never get invited? If you 
want to match furrowed brows with Bob Schieffer, it would have been 
smarter to work first on the sets of "M*A*S*H" or 
"The Rocky Horror Picture Show." 


CBS matched savvy National Review editor Rich Lowry with radical-left 
actors Mike Farrell and Susan Sarandon. This is one 
week where liberals might have complained about the imbalance to the 
right, one conservative heavyweight and two leftist 
lightweights. It was painful to watch, and we were all in trouble when 
Schieffer began his interview with Farrell by chatting like a 
smitten fan about how much he loved him as "the other doctor" on 
"M*A*S*H." I loved that show, too, but it doesn't stop me 
from wanting to stomp on Farrell's wacky political agenda. 


On "Fox News Sunday," Tony Snow was wading warily through the gaseous 
fog that is Janeane Garofalo's mind. This woman 
makes Joe Biden look sophisticated. It's apparently riveting TV to match 
geopolitical wits with the star of "The Truth About 
Cats and Dogs" as she talks about "Operation Desert Fox." Maybe she's 
seen James Mason play Nazi Field Marshal Erwin 
Rommel in the 1951 movie "Desert Fox." Or maybe she was just thinking 
about appearing on Fox. Maybe she is a fox. I don't 
know. 


In yet another appearance on MSNBC, host Mike Barnicle asked Garofalo 
who was more dangerous, Saddam or President 
Bush. She claimed, "they are both very threatening to world peace, and 
to deny that is to be incredibly naive." Really? Well, 
sure. "There has been a war on the people of Iraq since 1990. The plan 
to go into Iraq for hegemony over the region has been 
in play for a very long time, and the ideologues in this administration 
want to go in." 


Spare us. Garofalo here is merely chanting the mantras of 
America-loathing crackpots like Noam Chomsky and Ramsey Clark, 
who spent the 1990s blaming the United States for starving Iraqi 
children with an embargo, even as Saddam Hussein made 
food unavailable to his people while he loaded up on weapons 
manufacturing. 


Giving these "artists" a little room to rant quickly reveals the lie 
behind their campaign's claim to be a "mainstream voice" for 
"patriotic Americans." Anyone taking the "artists" seriously must be 
prepared to deny the truth that the 
Sheen-Garofalo-Farrell-Sarandon crowd represent a hard-left fringe, 
decidedly outside the American mainstream on war and 
peace, and nearly everything else. 


I believe the challenges we face are too serious to play jokes on the 
American people. But then I consider that on the brink of 
war, we deserve a few laughs to ease the pressure. So I look forward to 
the next Garofalo interview.

This does not surprise me. You have always made bold and unique decisions. The types that appear to be influenced by the heavenly power from above and make you stand apart from the rest. May the Lord continue to bless you in everything you do.

Dear Governor Bush:

I would like to share with you one paragraph from today's "The Tribune", the paper in Fort Pierce, it's the last paragraph in today's editorial, "We believe the governor has done well in appointing an individual of Jennings' stature and we welcome her return to public service.  We're optimistic Jennings and Brogan will carry out their new roles with enthusiam for the good they can repsectively do for the people of Florida."

This is from a strickly Democrat paper.  It's about time they decided to give accolades to some Republicans.  The top of the next page was a picture of you and Toni answering a question. Don't know what the question was, but you had a scowl on your face.  So we basically won one page and lost the next.  Oh well.  One day the Republicans will take over Scripps Howard and we can make our views dominant!

My blessings to you and to Toni Jennings. May our Lord Bless you abundantly in this new working union you have began. May Jesus guide your steps and your decisions always.  May the Holy Ghost give you the strength and insight to keep us all safe and from harm.  

The prayer that guides me daily: "Oh that You would Bless Me Indeed, and enlarge my Territory, that Your Hand would be with Me, that You would keep Me from evil, that I may not cause pain, and the Lord granted my wish."  The prayer of Jabez, Chronicles something or another. Don't remember where exactly.  I write it daily in my day planner. I write it when I am making important decisions or when I feel the need for the extra guidance.

Dear Governor Bush;
     This is Samantha Feingold. Thank you so much for sending a letter of recommendation to several colleges on my behalf. I have worked very hard and hope to receive some good news very soon. Best of luck to you on your new lieutenant governor, Toni Jennings. By the way, Frank Brogan will be right down the street from me. I recently completed three college courses at FAU under the dual enrollment program.
     Just a little update on the teen trendsetter program I established at Spanish River High School and Calusa Elementary. There are twenty-five students receiving weekly mentoring. I hold bimonthly meetings with the high school students to provide lesson plans, reading materials and books for the students.  The grant money has been used  to order books and workbooks. Next month I am bringing in a "mad scientist" to perform interactive science experiments for the students and parents. As you know, one of my passions is science research and I feel strongly that students need more involvement and interest in science, especially since there will now be a science FCAT. 
     "Reading is the key to success, but science is the path to the future."
     Thanks again for your kind words and support. I am forever grateful.

Sincerely,
Samantha

Dear Ms. Rodriguez:

I have had the pleasure of practicing law with Clayton D Simmons over the

Attorney, I have handled 
several miscellaneous civil matters and have worked both with and against 
Clay in and out of

colleagues.

I have also worked with Clay in his role as president of the Volie E 
Williams
Inn of Court here in Seminole County. He did an outstanding job in 
representing 
our Inn. We worked together on programs and other Inn business and he ran a 
tight ship 
with excellent results.

Finally, legal ability and reputation aside, he has the temperament and well 
roundedness that
make an excellent judge. I have also worked with and know each of the other 
candidates in this
appointment process and by far and above, Clay is the best person for the 
job! He has my support
and my vote. I appreciate any consideration you can give him.

Dear Governor Jeb Bush,
I would like to start by saying, that I am sooo
thankful that you have become our Govenor once again,
for the state of Florida. I have nothing but respect
for your whole family. I am thankful that your brother
George is our president and you are our Governor. 
Your family as a whole has brought back Respect,
Honor,
Truthfulness, Patriotism, and Love for our God,
Country and our families. Thank you again so much, for
bringing Faith back into our Country!

On another note:
Recently our Private Homeschool group was informed of
the hiring of Dr. Alex Penn Williams.
Though I am sure she will do a fantastic job for the
public schools, I am a little concerned if she should
be the overseer of Private and Homeschooling
Education. 
I started Homeschooling 8 years ago my two daughters.
Still actively involved in 4-H, gymnastics, violin,
basketball and Church. I know this has been the best
source of education for my daughters. They are not
sheltered from the world on the contrary they are
quite involved as mentioned. But they are shown
constant love and support for there talents. My
daughter who is 12 even publishes her own magazine
every two months. 
Getting back to the issue at hand. When I was told
that Dr. Alex Penn Williams was hired to oversee us, I
was a little concerned. I know for a fact,
homeschooling is much different then the public school
realm. We find curriculums that work for the children.
We focus in on there talents and encourage them to
grow more in the gifts they were born with.
Homeschoolers and Private Schoolers score much higher
on there tests, then the average public school
students. I went to public school all growing up. I
know Homeschooling is a better atmosphere for
learning. They stay focused on there studies. After
school, we then have them get involved in other
outside activities. 
When we voted for our wonderful President. The people
of the country voted Him in.
When we voted for you our Govenor, the people of this
beautiful state voted you in.
When we voted for Mayor, the people of this city voted
Him in. 
Why can't Private Schools and Homeschoolers vote for a
person with Private/Homeschooling background be voted
in by us.
Someone who has successfully raised their children to
become successful, productive, caring individuals,
giving back to this country and others following their
footsteps. 
Please Govenor Bush, please consider hiring someone
with this background, who can speak for us their in
Tallahassee. 
Thank you for your time Mr. Govenor.
With great respect for you and your family,
I pray God will bless you and your entire family,
Mrs. Lori Snodgrass

Dear Gov. Bush,
 
  A really good speech.  I wish citizens really would care for each other and practice the Golden Rule.  Many do.  Too many don't.  There is way too much fraud in this state.  Particularly where elderly folks are concerned.  Is fraud business?  Or is it a crime?  FL regulators like those who AARP and I dealt with were ineffectual.  Some moved on to jobs with those they regulated.  Some, were promoted somehow.  I wish you could "can" so-called regulators and use the money to hire more teachers.  If "buyer beware" rules, who needs "do nothing" regulators?  Prominent Warning Labels would be cheaper and more effective.  Like the one I suggested.  PLEASE push for it.  Regards, Dave Jonsson

The County is currently undergoing a dredging project on Coral Gables Canal. In order to get equipment into the canal to dredge, they had to remove this guard rail.

State charges sheriff with 25 election violations 



Charlotte County Sheriff William E. Clement has been charged with 25 election violations by the Florida Elections Commission for alleged illegal activities in the 2000 sheriff's race. 


Though Clement won't face any criminal charges stemming from the commission's findings, he could be forced to pay more than $40,000 in fines. 


If the state decides to pursue criminal charges based on the findings, Clement could face six third-degree felony charges for allegedly making illegal promises in exchange for support and for accepting excessive cash contributions. A third-degree felony is punishable by up to five years in prison. 


"It's vindication for all the disgruntled deputies who told the truth," said Kenneth Dudding, the retired Sheriff's detective who filed the complaint more than a year ago. 


Dudding claimed Clement promised high-ranking jobs to him and several others in exchange for their support, then forced them out of the department once he took office. 


After a year of collecting sworn statements from witnesses, state officials found probable cause to charge Clement with 25 violations instead of just the original seven outlined in Dudding's complaint, according to FEC findings released Monday. 


The Sun could not reach Clement for comment Monday evening. He told local media he had not received the FEC findings. 


The FEC found Clement violated Florida law by offering Dudding and Louis Williams jobs as lieutenants in exchange for their support. 


Dudding claimed that Clement promised to promote him to lieutenant in exchange for Dudding collecting money from deputies to buy signs endorsing his campaign. 


According to witness David Scheid, at a September 2000 campaign meeting, Clement reportedly told Dudding, "If you want to be my lieutenant in internal affairs, you better get on the ball with the signs." Scheid was later asked to resign from the department after an internal affairs investigation. 


Williams said he dropped out of the 2000 Sheriff's race after Clement promised him a job as a lieutenant. After Clement won, Williams was hired as a community relations specialist but was fired six months later. 


The FEC found insufficient evidence to justify the claims of at least four other campaign volunteers who said they were offered jobs. 


The state also found that Clement allegedly broke the law by accepting donations from deputies to buy campaign signs, but not reporting the money. The signs were also a violation because they weren't marked as paid political advertisements, records show. 


In a deposition, Clement said deputies approached Dudding about buying the signs, and though he was aware of their activities, he had no contact with any of them and never saw the signs until election day. 


Dudding and two other witnesses, however, testified that Clement discussed buying the signs many times, the report stated. 


Dudding claimed 11 deputies contributed a total of $580 to buy the signs, but none of the contributions were ever reported by Clement. 


The FEC said Clement illegally accepted cash contributions in excess of $100 12 times, including the 11 deputies who contributed for the campaign signs, and a $5,000 loan from millionaire Barbara Hunt, who had also run for sheriff in 2000 but dropped out. 


Clement reportedly gave $1,500 from Hunt's loan to his sister so she would donate it to his campaign. He used $1,000 to make a donation on behalf of his own business, William Clement Investigations, and kept the rest for living expenses because he was running out of money, the FEC found. 


According to Florida law, Clement could be fined three times the amount of the illegal contributions. That could amount to $16,740. 


The commission also found that by accepting Hunt's loan, Clement broke the law against candidates accepting more than $500 at a time. This carries a penalty of three times the illegal contribution -- $15,000. 


Clement could face fines of up to $1,000 for the other violations, which are first-degree misdemeanors. 


Last year, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush <mailto:http://www.state.fl.us/eog/govmailform.html>  appointed a special prosecutor to investigate if Clement violated any elections laws. The prosecutor was recently given an extension until May. 


Clement has 30 days to request a hearing before either the FEC or the state Division of Administrative Hearings. If Clement waives the request, the FEC will issue a final order that "may include a substantial fine," documents show. 


Former Sheriff Richard Worch, Clement's opponent in the 2000 campaign, said he wouldn't comment on the charges until "after Clement had his day in court." 


He did address the violations, however. 


"This is not a minor clerical error," Worch, said paraphrasing a comment Clement once made about the allegations. "This is essentially saying he took the election by fraud." 


Worch said he was aware of several of the alleged violations in 2000, and he could have gone to court to get an injunction that would have kept Clement from taking office. 


"I didn't do that because the people had spoken," he said.

Dear Dr. Penn Williams,

 

     Thank you for your letter of introduction.  It is good to know the background of the person who is representing such a large part of my family's life.  We very much appreciate the precious gift we have of being able to homeschool our children.  We take this privilege very seriously.  Homeschool is so very different than any other type of education option.  It is one on one and personal.  It is process and progress instead of structure and curriculum.  We are teaching children to learn instead of teaching a curriculum to be learned.  The children take ownership of their learning and run with it.  Sometimes it is challenging to hang on as they fly through their learning experience.  These are the joyful times.  Of course, there are times when we must strongly encourage them to travel a less exciting road to learning, but to see their shining faces when the light goes on is priceless.

 

     We as homeschool parents pay a price for this opportunity.  One that we gladly pay everyday.  The joys are great, but so are the responsibilities and financial sacrifices.  We gladly exchange these for the freedom we have to teach our children the way they should go.

 

     We will pray for you, your family and your position.  Please help us to continue to be free to teach our children.  Our concern is too much regulation.  Please know that we do take this freedom and right seriously.  We want the best for our children.  They are our future.

 

     Thank you,

     Anne Marie Sargent

Adoption--
I am almost 30 years old, I don't have the rights under current law to know who I am--oh, I get my health records--but not my history. You aren't adopted so you have never lived with the idea, you don't know who you are--I am in my place in life, but would like to know the names of my parents, and would like to see my own records to know why, rather than have to ask someone myself--I want the rights to my own full records! As an adult- I can get any of my medical records, I can die for our country, I can adopt, I can raise kids, I can drink if I wanted to--but damned if I can see the records of my own history! 
My problems are very petty compared to dealing with everything else, but if you don't deal with it personally you may never know how it feels, and it really stinks to leave places blank in a family history because you don't know the answers that you should be entitled to.

Dear Governor Jeb Bush,
 
 
It has come to my attention that Mr. Simmons has applied for the position of Circuit Judge here in Seminole County.
 
I am writing this letter to you as a concerned Florida resident and a friend to Mr. Clayton D. Simmons.  Let me explain briefly about my background and this will show a foundation to my insight into Mr. Simmons the attorney and the person. 
 
Raised in NYC and educated in electronics. At 52 I’ve worked for Major Corporations in the engineering field for over 30 years. In the early 80’s to the late 90’s I owned and operated a multi-million dollar manufacturing company. And in 1990 my wife, two children and I moved to central Florida. Over the years I’ve worked with hundreds of individuals and hired many attorneys for different transactions in both NY and FL. So you see Governor Bush it’s like the pizza box says “ I’ve tried all the rest… Mr. Simmons is the best” Let me explain!
 
In moving to Florida I needed to find a good accountant and attorney.  It is not easy.  I talked to many attorneys and they all will tell you that you have the old smoking gun at the first meeting and then as you move forward things tend to change. Mr. Simmons was recommended by another attorney as an “attorney’s attorney”, a professional, top shelf, straight shooter and a decent human being. And that he is. Time and time again.
 
I first met Mr. Simmons when my wife and I retained him to represent us in an attempt to recover $100,000 from a con-man.  He aggressively represented our interests and succeeded in recovering almost all of our money in a very innovative manner, even though many other people were unsuccessful in pursuing their losses from the same con-man. We have never had an attorney like Mr. Simmons that made himself so readily available to advise us when we have any legal questions.  About this time Mr. Simmons became not only our attorney but our friend Clay, and has been a friend of the family for the past 10+ years.
 
 
In closing, I consider it an honor to write a letter of support for Clayton D.  Simmons. He is honest, moral, forthright and a gentleman.  He is a Senior member of a highly regarded law firm in the Seminole and Volusia County area. He has an excellent reputation in the community. Clayton D. Simmons is exactly the kind of person that the state of Florida needs as a Judge and Governor Bush you should appoint him to the 18th Judicial Circuit Bench. Thank you.
 
 
God Bless America & God Bless our Troops!
 
Best Regards,
 
Joe Morreale

Hundreds Protest Bush's Plan to Move State Library
By Randolph Pendleton Associated Press Writer 



Published: Mar 4, 2003

  
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) - Hundreds of library supporters circled the state library Tuesday to protest Gov. Jeb Bush's plans to move its book collection to private Nova Southeastern University in South Florida. Secretary of State Glenda Hood came out to tell the group that the change would actually improve access to the books, but she was drowned out by chants of "Save our library" and "Send Bush to Nova." Bush's proposed budget for the next fiscal year includes cutting staff positions and sending the library's circulating collection to Nova, in a move the governor contends will save $10.2 million over the next four years. The plan includes the payment of $5 million to Nova over the four-year period to move and house the collection of more than 680,000 books. Hood said the opponents of the move had received misinformation. "I want to make sure that people have accurate information," Hood told reporters, while the chants continued. "It's very, very important that they do." "And I want to invite everybody to come inside and see the archives," she shouted to the crowd of more than 300, which continued chanting. The group, which included representatives of the Florida Library Association, the Florida Historical Society and the Florida Geneological Society, formed a circle around the library before Hood arrived, holding up signs that said "Floriduh," "Don't Privatize the State's Library" and "Move Jeb Instead." Earlier, a half-dozen members of the group gathered in the lobby in front of the House chambers, where Bush was delivering his State of the State speech, some of them carrying protest signs. John Szabo of Clearwater, vice president of the Florida Library Association, said he was encouraged at bipartisan opposition to the move in the Legislature. Senate President Jim King, R-Jacksonville, has said he opposes the move while House Speaker Johnnie Byrd, R-Plant City, has yet to take a position on the proposal. "It's simply a bad idea to shatter the state library into so many pieces," Szabo said. Hood said access will be improved because the books will be located in populous South Florida and Nova's library is a public-private joint venture that is open to anyone with a Broward County library card. The books that Bush wants to transfer are general circulation volumes that can already be obtained in many libraries and those that do not have them will be able to obtain them from Nova through inter-library loans, according to information distributed by Hood. The Florida Collection, which houses books about the state, and the archives will remain in Tallahassee. --- On the Net: State Library of Florida: http://dlis.dos.state.fl.us/stlib/ AP-ES-03-04-03 1703EST

Hello Governor Bush, 

 

          My name is Melisa Wilson and I am a nursing student at the Florida State University School of Nursing. I am also the president of the Student Nurses Association (SNA) here. This letter is to inform you that this week is Student Nurses Week. The Student Nurses of Florida State University work year round to improve the health and well being of Tallahassee. Yet all of our hard work appears to go unnoticed. Tallahassee Memorial Hospital gave us a cake to celebrate us, but other than this no one else has given us the recognition we deserve. In a time in which there is a shortage, I feel people should be encouraging and honoring nursing students for giving an amazing gift, themselves. So what I am asking is that you please make a declaration even though Student Nurses Week ended on Saturday, March 1, 03 and maybe when you have some time come by and see what the nursing students in this town are doing. This would be a great way to encourage student nurses and to expose others to the profession. If you would like to find out more about the FSU Student Nurses Association please visit our website at http://garnet.acns.fsu.edu/~maw9976.

 

Sincerely,

 

 

Melisa Wilson

Governor:

I am going to jot a few school choice notes down and get your opinion one
day next week, I am a little concerned on the message and I want to make
sure it is your vision we are following, and that I am on the right track.
On a related note, if we make some minor tweaks we should be able to handle
any programs you send our way with very little difficulty and little
personnel. What we would like to do is create a clearinghouse that allows
data to be inputed by the parent on the internet to tell them what type
scholarship their child qualifies for then they could proceed from that
site.  The district would verify.  We just about have the software
capability now.  In fact, Florida is head and shoulders in the nation on our
school choice software, and I predict we could sell them to other states
(particularly with McKay being a hot education item nationwide). All the
Best! JC.

Governor,
 
I don't want too long to go by without some communication...besides, I wanted you to see my cool logo!
 
Just a couple of thoughts:
 
1.  Your speech today was powerful, direct and personal.  You live by a certain intellectual and philosophic consistency, and others must be noticing it.  With the grace of God you will have eight years to redirect this ship of state; only one with such a strong conceptual framework can make that new direction permanent.  Its a joy to watch.
 
2.  I was asked by a teacher of GED students if they could get a picture with you...she's a strong supporter of you and obviously working with kids who are trying to reclaim their futures.  I told her I would ask.  If its OK, I'll call Betty.
 
3.  Toni Jennings!  Wonderful!
 
4.  You appointed my old friend, Craig Villenti, to the 2nd DCA.  We ran together for office in 1992.  He's a great guy and a fine judge.  I know you'll be comfortable with that choice.
 
All for now...I'm trying to craft my own place in this job market.  I've got to be the only lawyer in this town who is not really practicing law nor lobbying!  
 
Hoping to be a leader in solving regional and perhaps national water issues.  I'm working for both DEP and SWFWMD on helping communities develop alternative water supplies...as you know so well, this is one of those key public policy challenges for the next decade at least.  On the "big picture" front, I'm meeting with a noted land use author/lawyer to see if we'd like to co-author a piece on significant land use law reform.  Despite the cahnges in water and school planning, it is the one BHAG I could not deliver during my tenure as Secretary...perhaps we can work it from the bottom-up; making independent recommendations which could find their way into law.
 
You're my hero (well, after Lincoln and Colin Powell); please let me know if I can ever be of service.  
 
Steve

Subject: Good to see you in Washington



Dear Governor,

It was nice to see you in Washington after all these years.  I will include
my contact information at the bottom of this transmittal.  Please feel free
to contact me if I can ever be of any help to you.  And, I hope you will
also tell Mac that I asked about him.

Guy Rohling of Albers & Co. is the lobbyist The May Department Stores
Company uses in Florida on occasions when we have issues of concern before
the Legislature.   Guy told me that he introduced himself to you at the RGA
reception and told you about a revenue-raising idea we have which could
help you generate new revenue to off set the state's cost for the sales tax
holiday.  We very much appreciate the fact that you included the sales tax
holiday in your 2004 budget proposal ? our customers love it, and we have
found it does stimulate retail sales.

Our revenue-raising idea concerns the state's contract procurement
statutes.  It works this way:  Amend the state contract procurement statute
to prohibit the state (and other governmental entities subject to the
statute) from contracting for the purchase of goods or services with a
vendor if the vendor or an affiliate of the vendor meets the state's
requirements for collecting the use tax on remote sales but refuses to do
so.  We have been told this can have its biggest impact when state or local
government are seeking to buy electronics, such as computers, which are
frequently sold tax-free by out-of-state vendors.  I believe North Carolina
found that these companies wanted the state's business badly enough to
agree to collect the tax on the other sales they made into the state.

North Carolina adopted this statute in 1999, committed no state resources
to it ? just stated it as a prerequisite to entering into a state contract
? and, in the first year, collected approximately $8 million in additional
use tax.  The North Carolina provision can be found at N.C.G.S. Sec.
143.59.1.  Virginia also just adopted the requirement.  I am attaching a
copy of the Virginia language.  Several other states -- Connecticut and
Missouri, e.g. -- also are considering this requirement.  Obviously, this
also requires careful reading of the state's existing statute setting forth
the requirements for collecting the use tax.  I believe North Carolina, out
of an abundance of caution, also amended its use tax statute to provide
that a retailer making remote sales into the state is required to collect
the tax if the retailer consents, expressly or implication, to do so.  That
language is clearly broad enough to trigger the contract procurement
restriction.

I hope this is something that will be helpful to you.  Good luck in the
2003 session.

Large States Have Largest Budget Deficits
By Jim Burns
CNSNews.com Senior Staff Writer
January 09, 2003

(CNSNews.com) - California and Texas have the worst state budgets deficits in the nation and they are deepening, a legislative watchdog group said Wednesday.

The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) released "budget figures" showing California with a $35 billion deficit. Texas ranked "second worst" with a potential $12 billion budget deficit, recently surpassing New York State.

"These figures are simply staggering," said Michael Flynn, ALEC's director of policy and legislation. "But what's more alarming is that few states have yet to responsibly address this self-inflicted crisis, a decade in the making, which finally hit home well over a year ago."

ALEC said total state budget deficits for fiscal years 2003-04 now approach $90 billion nationwide.

Gene Acuna, a spokesman for Texas Republican Governor Rick Perry, said ALEC's figures on the Texas deficit represented "a guess."

"Our financial picture is still not known right now because our comptroller has not released her revenue estimates for the coming two years. Any figure like that at this point is a guess," said Acuna.

Acuna also said Perry would definitely not propose raising taxes to fix the deficit problem.

"The governor believes when economies slow, the burden should not be on the taxpayers to pay more, but on government to spend less," he said.

The GOP-dominated Texas Legislature will begin this year's legislative session next Wednesday. State Senator Robert Duncan (R-Lubbock), a member of the Senate Finance Committee, told reporters in Lubbock Monday, the deficit is due to the massive expansion in health care costs as well as enrollment growth in schools and in higher education.

In tackling the deficit, Duncan said lawmakers would have to analyze ways to cut back and ways to bring in more revenue. But, the Texas Legislature is "not big" on the idea of raising taxes, he added.

At the same time, some Texas Senate Democrats are warning their colleagues against cutting services to the poor. 
"Why is it the poor have to tighten their belts first?" Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, (D-San Antonio.) asked while meeting with reporters in Austin.

Sen. Judith Zaffirini, (D-Laredo), expects proposals to reduce enrollments in state health programs but believes those programs are reasonable investments in public health.

Zaffirini said opposition to tax increases might fade as lawmakers discard harder choices. She favors a House proposal to raise cigarette taxes by $1 a pack, potentially yielding $1.5 billion in revenue over two years.

"The cigarette tax increase may be anathema to some in January, but it may look more acceptable in May," Zaffirini said.

Last month, California Democratic Governor Gray Davis admitted California's budget gap soared to $34.8 billion. He warned residents of a fiscal crisis more perilous than even he had expected.

Davis blamed the high deficit on a "nosedive in personal income tax revenues," which will make it difficult for lawmakers to find ways to fund critical state programs.

Davis called on state lawmakers to get a "handle on the problem" because, otherwise, it could spawn tax hikes and downgrade the state's credit rating, he said.

The governor will unveil his budget proposals on Jan. 17. It is not known whether he will propose tax increases to erase the deficit. The state's "Legislative Analyst Office," California's version of the Congressional Budget Office, suggested a tax hike on "wealthy Californians" in order to get the state out of debt.

Insiders say heated debate is expected in the Democratic-dominated state legislature. State Senate President John Burton admitted to reporters in Sacramento that it would be difficult to attract enough Republican votes for the two-thirds majority needed to enact a tax hike.

"There are no Republicans who want to -- quote -- do Governor Davis a favor and I think that's kind of a short-sighted approach," said Burton.

One of those Republicans agreeing with Burton's assessment is Assemblyman Ray Haynes. "It's a fair statement because we don't have a revenue problem, we have a spending problem," he said.

"This governor in the last four years has grown California state government more than any other governor in the history of the state. (Republican Governors) Pete Wilson and George Deukmejian, during their 16 years in office, added 37,000 state employees. This governor in his four years in office has added 43,000 state employees," said Haynes.

"He (Davis) has increased welfare spending faster than any governor in the history of the state. If we reduce welfare spending to 1998-99 (levels) when he took office, we would solve our budget problem," Haynes said.

Some Republicans are proposing tax cuts, like Sen. Dennis Hollingsworth, (R-La Mesa), who introduced a bill phasing out the state income tax in 20 percent increments over a five year period for all tax brackets until the tax no longer exists.
Hollingsworth said the tax should be phased out for California's economy to improve and the deficit to be erased.

"I think Californians would be much better off without a personal income tax as well as the state coffers," he said. "The fact is that personal growth is stymied in states that have confiscatory personal income tax policy as we have in California."

Hollingsworth believes the tax "is even more damaging when you are competing with states that do not have a personal income tax. If we want to grow our way out of this deficit, we're only going to do that by raising personal income."

Hollingsworth is not optimistic his bill will pass the legislature but said, "we're hoping to get a fair hearing on this. I don't see that we are going to be successful given the liberal Democrat-dominated legislature and the governor that we have."

ALEC's list of the ten largest state budget deficits are: California with $35 billion, Texas with $12 billion, New York with $10 billion, Minnesota with $4.6 billion, Wisconsin with $2.6 billion, Michigan with $2.4 billion, Illinois with $2.25 billion, Washington State with $2 billion, Connecticut with $2 billion and Maryland with $1.8 billion.

Flynn admonished states not to look to Uncle Sam to bail them out of debt. "Raising taxes or clamoring for a federal bailout is not the answer, and in fact will only perpetuate and deepen the current fiscal crisis," he said.

"What's required is a candid and sober evaluation of each state's medium and long-term costs of operating government. It's only by reducing the size and scope of government in strategic and imaginative ways that each state finds a way out of its woes," Flynn concluded.






High intake, low budget 
THE first tremors from the baby boomlet began hitting the tree-lined campus of the University of Texas-Austin (UT-Austin) during the late 90s, when applications and enrolment started to rise dramatically.

The fall 2002 semester saw more than 52,000 students pack the university, including a record freshman class. Chemistry and biology labs were full, and officials had to cut next year's enrolment.

UT-Austin president Larry Faulkner says: 'We've got a lot of people here. I think we're too big under the structure we have now.'

But if size is one concern, money is another. This month, Texas legislators will begin grappling with a budget shortfall estimated at US$5 billion (S$8.7 billion) or more.

For UT-Austin, that means uncertain funding at a time when turmoil on Wall Street is shrinking the school's endowments as well.

Mr Faulkner also has money to worry about. His campus is taking a US$5-million cut this year in revenues it receives from the public endowment shared by his campus and 17 others in the state. 

And he expects that to drop further.

From his fourth-floor window, the university president also has an uneasy view of the dome of the Texas state Capitol, where legislators will meet this month to start hashing out a budget. 

'I think higher education will fare well in the context of the session,' he says, but he acknowledges 'that can still leave us in a difficult financial situation'.

The school, he says, needs an extra US$20 million to US$40 million a year to maintain buildings. The school also needs money to expand programmes. 

'We're trying to expand our faculty to lower our student-to-faculty ratio. It will be hard to continue doing that,' he adds. --USA Today

I just wanted to followup with you regarding our discussion that we had in our meeting on January 10th at the FIU campus office, where my husband Ahmed and I came to meet you. Governor, you might recall, I had requested you to see if there was any way to get a challenging position in AHCA, or the Department of Health.But I have not heard anything. I would very much appreciate all your assistance. 

Governor, I recently also received my license for Nursing Home Administrator, which qualifies me even  more to work for AHCA on their nursing home side where regulations for Nursing homes are formulated.

Thank you very much governor, I appreciate your help very much.

I hope to hear from you soon.

Nasreen Kabani, MHSA, NHA

Subject:	RE: A few humble words

Juan, the class size issue is a sad reality. It has little to do with student achievement. The counties where class sizes are the largest are the counties which have been the most inefficient in dealing with the issue. the counties that have the highest class sizes are the counties that have not taken advantage of their local option taxes. The counties with the highest class sizes are the ones that have the highest teachers salaries. How do we subsidize these counties at the expense of all the other counties? I am passionate about rising student achievement. This initiative will increase taxes and help counties that won't help themselves.

Subject: A few humble words


First, let me just say that I am a bit tired today so I really would not be
writing if it were not that I admire you. I don't want to write a book so I
will just get to the point. It is in reference to your State of the State
address today where you finally mention the class size issue. Before I
continue, I know there is a sign here somewhere since last Friday I was at a
luncheon at the Miami Airport Hilton and loh and behold Kendrick Meeks walks
in. He had a special section reserved with a big banner that said "I have
only just begun" so as usual what are the odds of me landing in the middle
of it. So back to your speech, I really do not want to use the word
"disappointed" so lets just say that I did not feel the energy that I
sometimes feel from you. I did not get enough feeling from your heart as
other times I have. I am specifically talking about the Class Size Amendment
that you finally let out that you would like for a special election to
resolve the matter. I really wish you would have been a bit more dramatic or
expressed more feeling into the subject so as to not come across as it being
an order as opposed to a plea for help or to be humble about the subject.
Although you may feel very strongly about the children and you mentioned the
reading initiative I felt there was something missing from you. This subject
is more than just about money for some. In many cases I have heard parents
say "if he (jeb) can't figure it out then he should raise taxes" You see the
problem is that this is about people's dreams, people tend to want to see
their children live a life that maybe they did not have and will always want
the best for them. As you know most parents would die for their children if
they have to. You are dealing with a topic that in some families is what
makes them feel like if they were millionaires. Some have been blessed with
Children that after many years of trying and praying they were finally given
and in many cases is what keeps families together and what keeps people
going day to day. So when talking about the subject (children) that is so
dear to people's hearts successful politicians will show more of a respect
for these matters.

So in case I have gotten a bit confusing, I have already said in previous
messages that I can deal with your K-3rd class size cap so that is not the
problem. The problem is getting the message accross without coming across as
having too much pride or forcing the issue upon the people. After all, too
much pride is why Lucifer fell from grace. This matter has to be dealt with
humbly and with tact. If your enemies paint you as incensitive and a monster
it will not bode well later. Don't forget that last year after the November
election I interviewed two women that both said that George (your brother)
would pay at the ballots if you failed them. I know you have said you are
not your brothers keeper but as a brother that I know loves a brother you do
care about these things.

Anyway Conclusion, Solution - Speak from the heart and all should be fine!

Time for bed,
Juan

Jeb,
I've written before over the insane amount of money the insurance companies are charging. Why do these companies have the
state's permission to rob people? I was paying $240 per month, now since my son got a license, $448 per month. How in the hell am I supposed to help the economy? We are not rich! Why on earth would our government allow this to happen. Oh yes, gas prices. Between gas and insurance there is no money to buy anything. I can't be the only one this is happening to judging from the crappy economy. Of course with the gas prices up this will make everything else cost even more. This don't bother the rich, they hoard their money and don't spend a dime. That leaves us working poor. The forgotten. I don't know what the rich have planned for the poor but it must have something to do with ending up with all of the money.
When is this government ever going to start caring for the masses(the unrich)?

Governor,
    In July 2002 my wife, Virginia Hood, was approved by your office to
enter the Long Term Care Ombudsman Program.  I am sure you are aware that
this program is staffed by UNPAID VOLUNTEERS and conducts regular
inspections and investigates complaints at the state's long term care
facilities.
    She completed her required training by the end of February 2003 and is
ready to start her inspections.  She has been informed that she must first
receive her badge from Tallahassee which may take 3-4 more months.  She is
extremely discouraged in that she cannot apply the extensive training she
has received.  Other ombudsman in the Pensacola area who are in a similar
situation are so discouraged they are considering leaving the program.
    As you work overtime to develop a budget in these hard times, I am sure
you would agree that volunteers can only help this program.  I fully realize
that the day-to-day workings of the Ombudsman program is well "below your
paygrade".  However, a word from you or your immediate staff to the
appropriate official just might provide the incentive needed to get this
important program moving at a reasonable pace.
    Thank you in advance for anything you might be able to do.

Dear Governor Bush,
	I read with great interest the article about you in the Washington
Post and especially the part about your sincere concern for healthy and
strong families.  I am a Supervisory Special Agent (SSA) of the FBI assigned
to the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit (BSU) at the FBI Academy, Quantico,
Virginia.  My colleague, Eugene Rugala, who is also an SSA and is assigned
to the FBI's National Center For The Analysis of Violent Crime (NCAVC) here
at Quantico, Virginia and I are co-hosting the FBI's Family Violence
Symposium at the Lansdowne Resort and Conference Center in Leesburg,
Virginia, from March 23-28, 2003.  This focus of this symposium is the "The
Impact of Child, Intimate Partner, and Elder Abuse on the family.  
	We are inviting experts in all of these areas together from all over
the United States to discover current issues and best practices in the areas
of Investigation, Prosecution, Intervention, Prevention, Research and
Legislation.  We hope to publish such a document at the end of the
conference.  We also hope that we will be successful in bringing together
the leaders who work in the three areas of abuse to foster a
multi-disciplinary approach to better treatment of victims and the
prevention of this evil in our society that tears at the fabric of our
families and results in more violence.
	We would like to invite you to participate with us and we would like
you to consider saying a few words to the attendees, if you like.  Please
let us know at your earliest convenience if this would be of interest to
you.  Thank you in advance for your consideration of this invitation.

Subject: FCAT IN FLORIDA PLEASE OPEN!


 Dear Governor Bush,  
    On March 3rd. this  letter is being sent to the St. Petersburg Time and the School Board of Pinellas County.  You are a good Governor  but Mr. Bush, the FCAT is very bad for the children especially the time it takes to Prepare.......it is hard on the educators also!  Isn.t there another way to classify the schools without the little ones being pushed to take a test first thing back to school.......and then spend more and more time and pressure to prepare so that . God forbid, we don't score and A!!!  What is going on?  What is the message?   For MONEY ?  What a joke,  and the Children are NOT put first in a place for the CHILDREN! 
 
[ Unfortunately, my granddaughter is enrolled in the public school system in Pinellas County.  A system that grades, intimidates, and psychologically batters our treasures; our Children.  Since when doesn't a parent have the right to vote on a test that is instituted soley for funding?  What happends to the "F" schools with less money?  What support do they have to climb out of the pits?  Who pays the consequences?  Our Children?  How much time does a good teacher have to take for pretesting  to take THE MOTHER OF ALL TESTS?  
    Only the second week of school my Granddaughter took a test to grade her school....of course she didn't  know her teacher, the pressure was on both from the beginnning of school(and I might add a shortened summer break because of this) to prepare .  She was intimidated immediatly because some of the material was above her level.......proving to her (or any other astute student) that she is lacking at school...instead of bolstering kids-the FCAT is a negative!  All this is for FUNDING!  For a school grade!  Focus is on the school for marketing purposes and funding---not on educating the children.  
    I am NOT against testing to see if curriculum is being learned........but  FCAT testing and the  ramifications of a grade to sell a school........Please someone listen to the concerned parents!  Maybe there is one person on the school board with a brain and a heart~]
 
    Thankyou for your attention Mr. Bush.  There are many many parents, besides myself,  who agree with me but don't know where to go for help.  All they get is letter after letter from the school on "being ready" for this test.  I know you will do what is right for our Children, starting with the smallest.
                                                                                            With warm regards and big hopes,

Wood ruling
By Tracey Early; tearly@wmbb.com
News 13 On Your Side
Feb 27, 2003

A Panama City man says fighting city hall is his first amendment right and he went to court to prove it. 
Three years ago, Kevin Wood needed 1,000 signatures to qualify to run for Bay County Clerk of Court. So he went to the best place he knew of: the Panama City Mall. 
"I went there, and I was collecting signatures and I got surrounded in the food court by mall security and Panama City Police officers," said Wood. 
Wood was arrested and convicted of trespassing. He appealed the ruling saying it was his constitutional right to petition in the mall. Thursday, the Fourteenth Court of Appeals ruled in his favor. Now he wants to exercise his rights again. 
"If we decide we want to go in there to do petitions for constitutional initiatives or to get on the ballot or for other petitioning activities, are we going to be threatened with trespass again?” said Wood. “I'd like to see the mall come forward and say, ‘you're welcome to come in’.” 
Wood is considering running for Bay County Clerk of Court in the 2004 elections. Meaning he'll need even more signatures. 
"When it comes time to get petitions than we'll go through the test again, and the mall will than decide what action they will take," said Wood. 
Some local residents say mall officials should act the same way they did three years ago. 
"A mall is privately owned, so it seems to me you should be able to set the rules," said Larry Taylor, a Panama City resident. 
"I don't think you should be allowed to go up and down the mall and things like that,” said Joseph Schlesinger, also an area resident. “But if we had an area set aside they could use, I think that would be appropriate." 
"That's fine if you want to go out there and petition, that's fine, but inside a public building, no I don't think that they should be able to,” said Erin Mercer, another Panama City resident. 
News 13 spoke with Panama City Mall officials. They said they were not in a position to comment.

Thank you for focusing on IT issues today at the Agency Head mtg.  I too believe that an enterprise model is the way to get the individual agencies to cooperate and gain economies of scale for IT needs/deliverables.  

Dr. John's suggestion of an Agency Head Advisory Group with STO would capture the individual 'need' side of the discussion while exposing each of us to the commonalities between agency deliverables.   

As we discussed previously, the Dept of Revenue also has information and IT experience that my Agency (and others) can benefit from - and the Agency Head Advisory Group would allow that dialogue to occur, under Kim's guidance and direction.

I am eager to assist where appropriate.

GOVERNOR BUSH ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT TONI JENNINGS, PAST PRESIDENT  of the

This is good news for Sierra, we have always had a good working relationship 
with former State Senate President Toni Jennings.  Lt.Governor Toni Jennings 
received the Florida Chapter Sierra Club Legislator of the Year award during 
her service as President of the Senate in the year 2000.

She was instrumental in stopping many of the bad bills from passing the last 
week of session because of her commitment to the process. She made it clear 
to her fellow senators that if the bills became weighted down by amendments 
that were once bills themselves, she would not allow them to pass the 
Senate. And in many cases, she indeed let many bills die on the calendar 
that year.

Would it make sense to meet you in our FLVS offices at the ELC (same building) after the inauguration program instead? If not, we are booked to fly to Miami and are happy to meet you there. 

I am in Tallahassee trying to keep up with Mark. All is well but rather mirky right now in regards to a funding model. We are looking forward to seeing you.

Hi Jeb, 
 
It is with a very saddened heart that I write this e-mail and tell you that my husband's illness has now become terminal, and without a major miracle from God, probably has less than 2 mos. to live. This has totally devastated our whole family, because we never dreamed that the big husky, "healthy as a horse" man would ever become this ill in a relatively short time. A bone marrow biopsy was done on Feb. 13, and he was found to be in the "advanced stages of leukemia", and the ONLY option - which has only a 10% chance of being successful - was Chemothrapy. He was admitted to the hospital, chemo started and after only 3 days his kidneys started failing and he was going into "renal failure", and the chemo had to be stopped. His condition has basically gone "downhill" from there. Had another bone marrow biopsy this past Mon., and the results of that (expected today), will determine whether or not to put him back on chemo. 
 
I told you that to tell you this - I had to go over to Hendry Correctional Inst. to notify John of his Dad's illness. Thank God, our Pastor was kind enough to go over with me, because I just knew that I did not have the strength to handle this ordeal alone. A few days prior to this visit, I had spoken with the warden there, Maj. Henson, to find out what, if any proceedures there was to allow the inmates to attend services for family. He was very kind in telling me that in some cases a "furlough" could be arranged. Then when I mentioned this to John, he told me that I would be charged "about $80.00 per hr., for the 2 officers that would transport him, and that he would have to come in handcuffs and shackled!!!  I think this is absolutely dispicable!!!  Dear God in Heaven, the grief of losing a loved one will be unbearable enough, and to have to have my son attend his Dad's service in that manner would just be more than I could handle!!!  Now, I could understand this measure if he were John Wayne Gacy, Ted Bundy, or some other prisoner in maximum security, but he is in minimum security, has been a "model prisoner" for his full time, has had no "D.R's", etc., etc. so, I am sorry, but I just can not see that this would be necessary. He said that he would not embarrass the rest of the family by coming to the service in this manner, and with knowing that I could not possibly pay the fees for the 2 men to transport him. 
 
I know that Mike Moore is not at D.O.C. now, and I do not know the new Secretary, so did not want to contact him. Actually, he may actually "know of" John, because John spent a year at Starke, and was in the electrial crew that installed the satelite system on Death Row, before he was transferred over to the Work Camp there under Maj. Jennings. 
 
I don't know what, if anything, you can do in this situation, but it just breaks my heart, knowing how John loves and respects his "Dad" (as you know, Bob is step-Dad, but is the only Dad that John has had), that he will be denied the opportunity to pay his last respects. During the last year's visits, he and his Dad have been making a lot of plans for all the things they were going to do when John is released in Feb. 2004. 
 
Please keep us in your prayers - we need a MIRACLE, and we need it NOW for Bob, and I just need all the prayers I can get to give me the strength to get through this. God Bless you and yours,

I know this is a long shot...but I don't want to miss an opportunity is one 
exists..........Our lodging industry leadership Board will be in town next 
week for the Tourism Day festivities.  If there is any way you could stop 
by and visit for a few minutes it would be a great opportunity for these 
folks to express our great appreciation for your support of the tourism 
effort.  On Monday, the Board will be meeting from 1:30 pm to 5 pm at our 
headquarters building, Hospitality Square, then a private dinner at the 
Radisson from 6:30 pm to 8:30 pm that evening.  On Tuesday we are back at 
Hospitality Square from 8:00 am to 9:30 am.  Maybe on your way to or from 
the office, or something, you could stop by for a few minutes at any point 
during any of these three events.

Thanks for keeping us in mind.

My youngest daughter, Amber, is fifteen.  She has multiple health problems. Two of her doctors have had to reduce their practice to three days a week because they cannot afford the malpractice insurance.  It reduces their monthly cost $1,000 a month to reduce their practice almost in half.
 
This, of course, makes it difficult to obtain an appointment and get the care Amber needs.

just a tiny light bulb. It's an amazing picture. Have a good day!
 
Beatrice




This was taken by the crew on board the Columbia during its last mission.
This photo was taken via satellite, on a cloudless day.
The picture is of Europe and Africa when the sun is setting. Half of the
picture is in night. The bright dots you see are the cities lights. The top
part of Africa is the Sahara Desert. Note how the lights are already  on in
Holland, Paris, and Barcelona, and how it's still daylight in London,
Lisbon, and Madrid.
Notice how Belgium and Holland is one big light-bowl!!!
The sun is still shining on the Straight of Gibraltar, and the
Mediterranean Sea is already in darkness. In the middle of the Atlantic
Ocean you can see the Azores Islands; below them to the right are the
Madeira Islands; a bit below are the Canary Islands; and further south,
close to the farthest western point of Africa, the Cape Verde Islands.
Note how the Sahara is huge and can be seen clearly both during daytime and
nighttime. To the left, on top, is Greenland, totally frozen.
Fantastic!

Subject:	My answer to you on State library move to Nova - it's embarrassing

Governor Bush,
Thanks for asking. Here are my points:

1. The decision to transfer the circulating collection to South Florida/Nova did not come from the researchers/librarians/historians who use the collection and depend on it. It appears to be a political/budgetary decision made in a vacuum without input from the users.   Note: on contentious environmental/land use issues, Floridians are urged by your administration to "build consensus" and develop task forces with industry, environmental and community representatives. Why was this not done here?

2. It's reasonable to assume it is makes more sense for researchers to work in the state capitol - where ALL records can be found. It is cumbersome, expensive and illogical to expect researchers to travel to South Florida for one thing and conduct months of research somewhere else. 

3. Why Nova? I know you personally have a penchant for South Florida, but Nova doesn't have a reputation for nor shown any interest or inclination to research/showcasing of Florida history.  Isn't it a PRIVATE institution?

4. You are paying $5 million to transfer the circulating collection. Isn't this a terrific waste of funds? Sure, the state faces an economic downturn but don't start making long-term and irreversible mistakes to fix short-term problems.   What are you funding now that could be postponed? Perhaps that airport in the Panhandle that benefits St. Joe Development?  Turnpike roads to nowhere where development does not now exist? 

5. The closing of the state library (now modified) came with other cuts and reassignments  that negatively affect the entire Historical Resources Division.  Again, I say, many Floridians care about their history, their culture, their natural and cultural heritage. And we will rise up and protest and do something about cutting the very few, poorly funded programs and facilities that now exist to support Florida's heritage.  That's just what happened last year when your administration decided to "de-fund" the Florida Folk Festival on its 50th Anniversary. The Festival lived on -thanks to the people who created it and have support it for generations.

To better understand how passionate Floridians are about their history, perhaps you should visit the Florida Folk Festival this year at beautiful Stephen Foster State Park over Memorial Day weekend and take the time to listen to the folk songs of Florida and the people who sing of Florida. 

Thank you for listening.

Jeb,

	As a Republican voter I would like to speak for myself and several
other of my voting republican scuba divers who may not have the chance to
email you concerning the opening and preservation of springs in our
beautiful state.  My passion lies in the springs and caverns provided to us
by God and the fact that through His inspiration and technology we are able
to explore these wonderful sites.  Harold is the owner of Cypress Springs
and is currently trying to open Becton Springs to divers.  With the powerful
and well-funded bottling companies opposing Harold, this may become
impossible.  I would like to voice my concern and hope that you will make
every effort to ensure the opening and security of these springs for voting
american scuba divers in florida along with the many, many visiting voters
who frequent our state's dive sites.  These visitors do bring a considerable
amount of revenue to our state in their travels.

Hello 
I was referred to your office for a question about my husband Cecil Driggers D.C.# V07073. I spoke with a Mr. Parker in classification at Madison CI, as well as someone from population management in Talahassee (I think Mr. Kemp). My question is simply why was my husband transferred? It was just unexpected since he has not been at his camp for a year, and I didn't know if he was being transferred as a punishment, or if he had been accepted to one of the programs he had signed up for. Mr Parker said it was possible that he was being put in a mandatory GED program because of his age (21), and that Gulf CI was one of the only Institutions with the literacy training program. I was also inquiring as to why was he transferred to an Institution that happens to be 520 miles away rom our home in Orlando and would be an extremly rough drive for me and the kids to make. I would like for him to take advantage of any educational or training opportunities while he is in prison, but since he is still at the North Florida reception center I was wondering if maybe there was any  possibility of him being put a little farther south of Region I (Gulf CI) to the mandatory literacy program they offer at Sumter,Polk,Marion, Avon Park, or Lake Institutions. Thank you so much for any help or information you can give me.

Subject:	basic investment math

Company has earnings of $1.00 / share and price per share of $20.00

*	Included in those earnings is 20 cents / share of “income” based on “gain” of pension plan
*	This 20 cents of income is based on assumption that pension plan earned 9%, while in fact, it lost 5%
*	Had the actual earnings been used and subtracted from company stated earnings, reported earning would have been only 78 cents a share.
*	Pension assets have dropped so that now, an extra 25 cents a share is required to meet pension funding requirements, and earnings per share drop to reported 75 cents.
*	Investors, seeing a 25% drop in earnings, rush to sell.  Stock drops to $12.00 / share.    The value of all pension plans owning that stock drop accordingly.     
*	Assuming the total return on a pension plan owning this stock in its portfolio is below the assumed rate, such pension plan would need added funding, likely resulting in reduced earnings for THAT company, and so on and so on.

 

As company after company needs to increase funding to the pension plan, they either need to reduce payroll, benefits, purchases, advertising,  dividends, earnings, etc.    And that is assuming they can maintain revenues enough to offset increased property taxes, health care costs, government mandated expenses.

 

Where might all this be heading?  Could this affect Florida’s pension plan?    Who is John Galt?

This is Pam Mullarkey who used to be a board member of your awesome Foundation for Florida's Future.  Since that time I finished two terms as a school board member in St. Johns County, and 10 years ago I started Project SOS, Inc. (Save Our Students).  We teach sexual abstinence to teens as well as abstinence from drugs, alcohol, suicide, crime and any other risk behavior.  This year we will reach 30,000 teenagers with our programs and mentoring clubs called APE Clubs (Abstinence Protects Everyone). We are located in northeast Florida and serve six counties. Over 75% of the teens commit to abstinence after taking our programs and after 18-month follow-up evaluations, 90% have kept their commitments.

On April 22 at the University of North Florida we are having our 10th year celebration gala called ABSTINENCE: CELEBRATING FREEDOM 1993-2003!  We would be tremendously honored if you could be our guest and speak for 7-10 minutes about your commitment to help our teens make healthy choices.  You have been instrumental in funding abstinence education and my friend John Agwuenobi, M.D. has been a great supporter for our cause. We have started a state organization that I am president of called Florida Abstinence Education Association.  We meet quarterly and help providers meet the needs of teens throughout the state.  As you may know, we are in a dog fight with MTV, Planned Parenthood SIECUS, etc. who all want abstinence funding to stop.  
The good news is that teens are smart and when give accurate information and the skills to make and keep a commitment to abstinence they choose the best path for their futures.
We hope you will be able to be a part of our great celebration as we highlight the wonderful success we have had as the largest abstinence organization in Florida and one of the most successful ones in the nation.  God bless you and keep up the great job you are doing. You and your brother and your families are in my families prayers on a regular basis.

Sincerely,

Pam Mullarkey Ph.D

Subject:	Re: Email from Mr. McDevitt to Gov. Bush

It seems that you miss my point of concern.  Whatever these items cost, it
is too much.  An agency that taxes property owners, should in my opinion
have a lot more respect for how the taxes are spent.  Doing the agency's
basic job, efficiently and effectively (and in a fair manner), is what the
taxpayer would like to see.  Spending our money to give us back a gift,
regardless of the message that goes with it, is not an effective use of the
money to which your agency is entrusted.  I get a cold drink insulator every
time I participate in a civic event, I hardly need another.  Most of us have
rain gauges from one vendor or another, to advertise their business.  The
gifts require storing, handling and distribution, which are hidden expenses.
I am not sure a community affairs person is necessary.  The newspapers and
television news shows pitch a lot of information regarding your water
restrictions, etc.  My immediate dismay was that in this period of tougher
economic times, when businesses and individuals have to work harder and make
smarter economic decisions, we have a situation that seems wasteful.  Beyond
that, what if every State agency (maybe they are) is giving out gifts and
participating in activities that maybe aren't as necessary as that
department thinks they are, how much spending is the result.  No wonder the
average citizen gets so discouraged about the public sector.  Former Senator
Everett Dirksen made the observation, "a billion here, a billion there, adds
up to real money".  Several thousand here, several thousand there adds up to
real money.

I hope you will accept these thoughts as constructive criticism.

Subject:	Transportation Disadvantaged Trust Fund

Governor Bush,
 
Please consider very carefully any and all legislation that would repeal  Chapter 427, F.S. and abolish the Transportation Disadvantaged Trust Fund.
The Transportation Disadvantaged Program was created to coordinate all local, state, and federally funded transportation programs to reduce fragmentation of services and to prevent fraud and abuse.  Transportation cost savings and efficiencies are increased by utilizing the coordinated system.  Medicaid transportation costs are difficult to control, not because of the coordinated system, but because of inadequate numbers of providers that will accept Medicaid.  In Okaloosa County we are having to transport Medicaid clients from Crestview to Ft. Walton, Ft. Walton to Crestview,from both areas to Pensacola at least 5 times a week, and occasionally to Panama City to get to a Medicaid Provider.  These long distances drive up the cost of transportation.   The elimination of the Transportation Disadvantage Trust Fund will not help control Medicaid transportation costs, it will only eliminate other much needed transportation for our seniors, persons with disabilities, low income and children at risk. The Transportation Disadvantage Trust Fund is used to transport these individuals that are not sponsored by some other agency.  In 2002 this fund provided 54,304 trips for Okaloosa County residents to get to work (35%), education and training programs (21%), nutrition (4%), and other life sustaining (12%) necessities.  These citizens depend on this transportation for their daily living and have no other form of mobility.  If the Trust Fund is abolished they will lose this necessary transportation. 
 
Providing transportation to our citizens is more than just Medicaid.  It means getting people without transportation to jobs, schools, children to daycare programs, and improves the quality of life for our disabled citizens.  There must be a way to solve the Medicaid budget crisis without eliminating a program that provides a much needed service to so many of our citizens.
 
Thank you for your support.

unconstitutional, because it was not printed on the ballot how it was going

I encourage you to appoint Rick Barnett to the position of property appraiser in Bay County.

I have known Rick for several years and believe he is more than qualified to do the job.  Rick is and has been active in Republican politics as long as I have known him.  He ran for the Bay Co. Property Appraiser's position in 2000 and has been active in various republican campaigns at all levels of government.  I know he was very active in supporting you during your last campaign.

Rick's interest in his community and in his government and his background in real estate make him an ideal choice for the property appraiser's position.  Thank you for your consideration.


Sincerely,

No, I do not think the State Board of Education would support that proposal.
I also think there would be constitutional issues.  I do not pretend to
speak for the SBOE nor am I a legal scholar.  However, we will gladly assist
you should you decide to pursue that angle, but I do not want to be overly
optimistic. I appreciate Broward County being concerned with the class size
amendment, it will certainly make an impact in our state. I would encourage
you to work closely with the Governor's Office and your legislators to
address this issue.  I would be glad to help you any way I can. I appreciate
all that you do for the children of Broward County and I look forward to
continued progress working with you.

Dear Governor Bush (Jeb), Hola!
 
Hope you are doing well! You did a good job on the State address!
 
Regretfully, my Mother (Gloria) is ill. She has been diagnosed with "Mantel Cell Lymphoma" cancer. She will be medically evacuated, this weekend, to the National Naval Medical Center at Bethesda, Maryland, and possibly later to Walter Reed National Army Medical Center, WDC. (My Father is an Army Retired World War II and Korean War Combat Veteran.)
 
My Mother, who is former School Teacher (Magna Cum Laude), Social Worker Supervisor, and a Valedictorian, has a positive will to fight this terrible decease. She always fondly recalls the photo she had with you and our Family taken during the 98 Campaign.
 
I will depart, on Friday, for the Washington, D.C. area,  to help coordinate my Mother's dangerous treatment. (It could be a few weeks.) Please, let me know if you come across any new Treatments in this Cancer area. 
 
Also, keep on beating all those "Alligators" away! You are doing great in solving the tough problems for our beloved Florida!
 
Have a very wonderful day!
 
Cordially, with warm regards, I remain at your loyal service, :-)

Good Morning, Jeb.  I haven't written for a while but I am still very active in our community.  Great Lieutenant Governor.  Hopefully this is who you had in mind when you made the statement that Florida is ready for a female Governor.

Our Cape Coral group is visiting you this month and you, as usual, are gracious to meet with all of us for ten minutes.  I have a special request for two of us.  It is hard to get a single point across with so many people.  Mike McCartney has been writing you weekly regarding our dock issue.  He is very much in touch with the needs and concerns of our area.  As you may know he is owner of American Marine Contractors here on the Cape.  May we have just a few minutes of your time alone, one on one, before or after the visit with the entire Cape Coral Group?  You have never turned me down in the past, please indulge me one more time.  This would really mean a lot to Mike and his agenda.  Thank you again for your assistants.

Dear Governor Bush,

As a user of the TD program and a member of the National Federation of the 
Blind of Florida, I strongly encourage you to consider the negative impact 
of passage of PCB HC 03-02 as it is now written.  The  bolishment of the 
state's transportation disadvantaged program will remove the only choice 
that many of our citizens have for transportation.

I am a college student trying to build a future for myself.  Last October, I 
fell while on campus, breaking my ankle.  I was unable to drive and had to 
use our TD program for several months.  Had I not had that option, I would 
have had to drop out of class and quit my part-time job!

I hope you will also consider that you supported the continuation of funds 
for the TD program in your latest budget request.  Thank you for your 
consideration in this matter.

Most Sincerely,

Kathleen Hicks

Good Morning,

 

If the issues of the high speed rail and class size are to be voted on again, would it be possible to put them on the Presidential Preference Primary ballot in March?

I'm just thinking about the fact that none of the counties budgeted for a countywide election in this off election year.  It would certainly save us millions by attaching the issues to the PPP instead of have a Special Election at another time.

 

Also, I'm personally happy that you choose Toni.  She a terrific lady!

I am writing to support reform of the State Amendment Process. The current
process does not allow our elected legislators to do their job - to debate
issues and produce responsible balanced legislation. Furthermore, too many
of the Amendments we are asked to vote on, are obvious special-interest
issues, that have no business being added to the Florida Constitution.

Subject: malpractice crisis




         Dear Governor Bush:

         I read this morning's newspaper article about your state of the State address and the various issues you touched upon.  I would like to address the malpractice crisis.

         Assuming lottery justice in malpractice cases is a valid concern, I believe there is a simple solution to the malpractice crisis and I predict both the trial lawyers and the insurance companies  will not like it, which means the idea probably has merit.  The proposal does not involve caps which , I believe,  may be held to be unconstitutional.
         
         The idea is this.  Pass legislation that requires the court to hire its own expert witnesses to testify at trial and pass along the cost to the non-prevailing party.   The reasons are as follows:

1.     Trials ususally involve competing testimony from experts aligned at opposite ends of the spectrum .  The jury is forced to either choose which experts to believe, in which case an all or nothing verdict can occur, or to compromise.

2.     The most credible person in the courtroom is the judge.  A neutral expert that the jury knows to be sponsored by the court will carry the most weight in the courtroom.  The threat of neutral expert(s)  testimony will force both parties to seriously evaluate their "realistic" postions (as opposed to "lottery" positions") before trial.   Malpractice lawyers and insurance companies both should  be reluctant  to pursue a case that may be compromised by the most credible expert in the courtroom, particularly if the losing side has to pay for their own experts and the experts supplied by the court.

Thank you for taking the time to consider this alternative.

I think we should put together a group of organizations to lobby for these issues( hospitals, universities, law enforcement officials, child advocates, etc.). By placing the issues before the voters on Amendment 9 and the bullet train, you can say you are giving those that want to raise taxes a chance to have their day while giving those who don't like the amendment will have another chance.

Dear Governor Bush, 

I am a supporter of you and your party as well as a full time citizen of the State of Florida. As such, I honor the constitution and laws of our great state. Our constitution promises freedom from excessive and unnecessary noise. This letter is intended to point out a grave violation of the spirit of our constitution, and in fact, a violation of the letter of our laws by our own state agencies. State statute 327.65 states that “every internal combustion engine used on any vessel operated on the waters of this state shall be effectively muffled by equipment so constructed and used as to muffle the noise of the exhaust in a reasonable manner.” We therefore have instructed our law enforcement agencies to uphold and enforce these laws, yet at the same time equip them with vessels that do not comply with those laws. It is an impossible position for those agencies.

I live on the Withlacoochee River 500 feet from the main channel. In my living room, I can hear the deep throated approach of an airboat from two miles away. As it approaches, it drowns out personal and telephone conversation,  radio and television sounds, and creates a morose atmosphere of invasion. This atmosphere continues from the first level of sound two miles away, past our house and two miles further up the river, then repeats itself on the return trip. This happens several times a day, particularly on weekends. 

This is a clear violation of the intentions of our legislators. Can a law enforcement officer run down this violator in a vessel which is just as loud? And if he catches him, will he be able to cite the driver of the DEP airboat who is on official business? 

There are two sources of sound emitted by airboats; the prop and the motor exhaust. There are newer designs of props that produce less noise and when geared correctly are relatively quiet and some that can be whisper quiet. The large combustion engines used on today’s airboats can and should be subject to the same emission standards required on our highways. Would you allow your limousine to produce 120 decibels of sound as it roared down the city streets? Or would it be correct for the State police to take the mufflers off of their vehicles to get more horsepower or to appear more macho?

Please correct this problem from the top down so that the numerous counties that have adopted Part II of Statute 327.65 will be able to enforce it.

Thanks for your consideration of this matter. Mine is not an isolated case; there are thousands of waterfront homeowners in Florida who are facing this problem, and thousands more potential waterfront owners who are unaware of the problem until they purchase their property: your program, Destination Florida, is adversely effected by this problem.

Respectfully submitted;

Ron Johnson

March 4,2003

     I read the Jeb Bush article in the Washington
Post-you are smart to converse mostly on e-mail. I
will try to make this short as I know your time is
limited and I don't even live in Florida. I have a
problem I need someone with authority to listen.
     In March 2001 I retired after 18yrs with the same
company. I requested my 401(k) retirement funds from
Daily Access.Com who is the admministrator for Paine
Webber Investments. I had been faxed a letter from the
company's practice manager 5 days short of my
retirement stating no transactions could be made 6-8
weeks as a new program was being processed.  I went
along with this as I was staying on for two more weeks
to cover for another employee. On May 5,after numerous
phone calls, I was finally faxed a distribution form
to sign and was told a check would be cut in 7-10
days. I received a check in SEPT after the 9/11 crisis
and the market fall-this was $11,000.00 short from
even my June financial statement.  
     This is an injustice-a company should not be
allowed to hold an employees funds 6 months and simply
call it a "Blackout Period" with no time limit.
Without a time limit law there is once again nothing
to protect the hard working American.  I have written
so many letters-including one to George W.- but my
letters only get passed down and to no avail.
     The Labor Dept. says they don't get involved
unless the case "goes public".  I can not believe
there is not a way to make this company take care of
this injustice.  A financial manager a Paine Webber
says it is due to imcompetent employees a DAC.  I also
feel there were internal problelms as our 
representative changed jobs from Wheat/FirstUnion to
Paine Webber and took the company account with him. 
All this at my expense-I feel an investigation is
warranted. I know this is not anywhere close to your
problem but I don't feel it should be ignored.  I am
sure this has and will happen to other Americans if
some law is not passed to prevent it.  Of course I
would love to see some action taken on this matter as
I worked hard for my money-otherwise it could surely
make good table conversation with a law maker.
     Thanks for your time.......

Keith, I humbly disagree. The high speed rail passed since people thought it was "cool" to have a really fast train running from Miami to Tampa. No costs were discussed. the higher taxes that are necessary will dramatically change the dynamic. The same applies to the class size initiative. Leadership goes both ways. If you believe in limited government, as George Schultz does and I concur, leadership dictates me to give the voters all the information.

Subject: George Shtulz once again--education



Hello Gov Bush,

In one of my communications with your policy department and subsequent emails to you, I suggested that you should consider the opportunity to promote, as Governor, a focus on strengthening the family. Recently, your emphasis during the inaugural and State of the State speech, show that we are very much on the same page on big picture issues and opportunities in your second term as governor, Jeb.

So I would like to once again use the resource of referring to George Shultz in our correspondence as a useful lesson for you as Governor now that you are initiating a new term with a new Lt. Governor.

The former Sec.of State for Ronald Reagan advocated in the 1980's a new "pre-emptive" military posture against terrorism, as Libya, and other sources of terrorism surfaced on his watch. He was unsuccessful at that time, and one can see, how better we all would have been, had things been different. 

He, first as foreign policy team transition director for your brother's administration, and then as advisor during his presidency, has been pivotal in the development of the new Bush Doctrine of pre-emptive action against terrorism which is changing the landscape of America's relationship with the rest of the world as we "speak."

The Shultz framework, as I have been suggesting, has application and relevance for your state domestic policy on a number of fronts. One I will note briefly is education.

The voters passed two referenda this past November both of which support notions I have been discussing with you for years, Governor. 

One, of course, was the Pre-K amendment. So now we have confirmation that the public supports the idea of daycare expansion, an idea I spent years advocating, mostly to no avail, in our correspondence. Your support of the amendment was really too late to benefit you in the way such support may have, had you been ahead of the curve on this issue, and as I have been proposing since you were first elected.

Also, as you recall, I have been discussing education reform with you and Jim Horne for awhile, and so I would like to draw upon the Shultz framework again to generate a small contribution to your understanding of this issue.

My big picture theme in talking about education has followed the Shultz model of first evaluating where the source of resolution for a problem is and second, what is the character of the obstacle in the way of progress. Then third, Shultz would craft a plan of action with a realistic and pragmatic application, producing the likelihood of success a public policy executive {such as governor} needs to achieve.

Our public policy leadership, in the legislature and in assorted institutional venues over the years has been debating and debating, and then debating some more, what reforms education should embrace to resolve the important issues so important to our nation's {and state's} future. The Florida Supreme Court's pending review of your initiative and other reactions to your reforms have served to delay and dilute your hard won plan. This, after literally decades of prior state leadership confusion and inaction on the issues of education reform.

So the Shultz model leads one to conclude that leadership is needed, and to face the reality that it has been the absence of tangible action by state leadership in the past which has served to "kick the can down the road" so to speak. Admittedly, your plan has not had the opportunity to fulfill all of its promise. But that in itself is the nature of the problem.

The public went through the lottery promises unkept, the endless debates, legal challenges and so on, and nothing much has changed, and more to the point, no one can claim the victory over the problems in education that we are all looking for. 

Net, net, Governor, from the public's point of view, but more importantly, from the point of view of the relationship of the public to its govenor, the November referendum mandating lower class sizes in Florida was a message that the public was now making the decision for its leadership. The public was saying, "you all haven't been able to form a consensus on what to do in education, much less actually achieve the substantive improvement needed, and so we are going to impose a decision on our own leadership."

This is an important lesson to draw from the class size vote last November.

So the source and character of the education stalemate are really one and the same-- they lie with elected leadership.

Education reform ultimately will have to find a solution which understands that only leadership and those in public office have the resources to manage this issue. When I talked to Jim Horne, just as he was to be announced as your new Commissioner of Education, he said he did not want to be responsible in that way. So you have a problem there, it seems.

I have a very simple plan which puts all of this together, and basically says if education reform is going to get done, elected public leadership is going to have to be responsible for making it happen. It is not going to happen through the courts, more parental involvement, or in a better "society." Those are excuses.

George Shultz, when he advocated the unpopular policy of pre-emptive action against terrorists, was taking the full responsibility for leadership in his own office. He was not looking for excuses to justify "kicking the can down the road," and hoping some future adminstration in a position of leadership would take care of it.

Ultimately, the Shultz model for success in education is going to happen, and it will happen along the lines I am outlining. Better to do it sooner rather than later Governor. 

Your sending the referendum vote back to the citizens is off target, and sends a confusing message to the public. The message this governor needs to send is the clear message that you understand it is elected public policy leadership's responsibility to solve the education issue. That the problems you face are not the fault of somebody else, and more to the point, your relationship with the public needs to be one of accepting this responsibility. 

Your friend,

Keith Long

If this is the case I will see you on the 19th I would rather NOT do this. Please feel free to fax or email back. I will send this by way of fax as well as per request

Hi Gov. Jeb.
Many thanks for your time and support today. Bob and I are very optimistic 
and encouraged.
Joe Marlin called this evening. I recounted our conversation on his water 
issue and your positive response. He is planning a call to follow up, I 
believe.
He asked about our citrus discussions. I indicated your support was positive 
as well and gave him, in confidence, a hint of our plan to enlist Brazilian 
cooperation on the tariff issue, including your direct participation.
I did NOT discuss any other matters of concern.
Thanks again.

Dear Governor, 

Since you are visiting our offices for the first time, can we please have just a bit more time than 30 minutes??? The office staff will want to meet you and shake your hand. I'd like to walk you around our little facility, which won't take long other than introducing you to people along the way. This could be very, very special for our staff. It is only our Orlando based staff so don't panic. I'm concerned that we won't have the full 30 minutes to actually talk business after we get you in the door.

Subject: Urgent - Your Help is Needed!
Importance: High


Governor Bush,

Today I am writing for your assistance with a matter that affects more that
just the individual I am concerned about, however, it is his interest I have
in mind.  Further - we live in Florida and have for 4-years now and this
ultimately comes down to a two state problem.  This individual is not a
criminal but is being treated like one.  His civil rights have been violated
and now his job is at stake.  I will try to be brief.

This individual did receive a DWI 5-years ago in a small town in North
Carolina.  He was not intoxicated, even the State Trooper testified to that
in court.  He had 2.5 beers and his blood alcohol level was .10 - which in
October 1997 -- this was the legal limit.  The trooper had to do his job.
He did not pull him over for reckless or careless driving, or weeving -- he
pulled him over for speeding.  On that note we had the vehicle calibrated
with proof that it was way out of calibration.  However, this would not even
be considered at court time.  Needless to say this individual was not from
this county or this state -- he was visiting me.  He was from Texas and
thinking about moving to NC at the time.  The trooper did not arrest him,
but had to take him to the jail for a breathalyzer test and he was told he
would be released after the test.  When he arrived at the jail - he was
taken to a room for the test and asked if he wanted a witness.  He told them
he wanted me there, but he did not know my number as he was just visiting
and I had a new phone -- but I was in the newspaper as I was the local
seamstress.  They refused to find my number and told him that he would have
to take the test without a witness.  Then they handed  him a paper to sign.
He told them that he had a disability and he did not read well.  This was
ignored.  He is also Bipolar and what happened next was very difficult on
him.  Because he had no one to call they refused to let him leave and made
him have a strip search with a female officer.  He was completely deviated.
Around 3AM I telephoned the Sheriff looking for him because I was frantic
when he did not show back up at my home -- they told me he was not there (he
was locked up) until 10:00 AM the next day and documented as "needing to
sober up".  Finally - he was released where he found a paper to contact me
and I was frantic.

We went to court in Feb 1998 where the Judge and the DA used slanders about
his heritage -- he is also American Indian in which they kept asking him if
he needed an interpreter and if used the Texas Slur when he spoke to the
trooper... many other innuendos. Long story shortened -- With no prior
tickets or anything he was given 3-years probation, 48 hours community
service, Alcohol Assessment, 120 days suspended jail, and fines.  Now - our
attorney said for him to appeal -- which he did.  Five years later after
many other nightmares trying to get this case heard in Superior Court -- (I
have ALL the documentation) - He is before the SAME JUDGE that was in
District Court - he is now a Superior Court Judge -- it was another
nightmare.  Too shorten this history again -- the attorney told us he would
never win the appeal and to just remand it back to District Court.  We were
devastated.  We had driven 13 hours to have his case heard by a jury and the
attorney (by he is lower income - because he hasn't had a license for
3-years now -- this is what this is leading up to) was court appointed by
the judge.  We left the court with the EXACT same sentencing as five years
before and more money owed.  It was awful -- and we had letters of his
community service, his doctor wrote one, many good character references --
they refused to look at them -- they were just awful!  I am a part time
officer for this county and I was taken back at the way they treated him - I
actually cried!  He was treated as if he had a record a mile long and I have
his papers -- he had never even had a stop sign violation!

Now -- here is the clinch -- After all is said and done -- he was assigned a
probation officer in which he had to come back the next day to meet.  The
probation officer said that he would be having to send his case to Florida
on an interstate compact.  That when he got here he would have to contact
the local probation office and get a probation appointment within 48-hours.
He did - this even gets worse.  It took nearly 5-months for them to get the
interstate paperwork taken care of - in which the probation officer here
says is normal -- however, he has not been able to get a drive to work
license because even after all this -- they suspended his license in NC for
another year.  They had suspended it in 2000 because they said he had a
failure to appear in their court. It was an error and taken away from his
record but all that time he was suspended on their ERROR!  Once again -- I
have all the papers to prove this.  The judge would not issue Eric a license
in NC because he is not from there.  He lived in Texas when he got the
ticket and Texas cannot issue him a license because NC cancelled his Texas
License.  Florida WILL NOT issue him a license unless NC sends a letter of
clearance.  His probation officer says "There is NOTHING he can do - I guess
you just can't drive".  He says call your probation officer in NC!  NC says
we are under NO obligation to help you now - you are assigned to Florida.
He has satisfied EVERY thing, paid his fines, done his Community Service
AGAIN, finished his Alcohol and Drug Program as ordered in 1998 -- (again -
all documented).  The judge in NC says he will issue and order to have his
license released and for me to get one.  Florida says they cannot do one
because it is a NC case.  NC says they can't do one because he lives in
Florida.  I have sent all his papers to the Judge and to the Florida DMV
here -- NO ONE can help.  I even contacted a Florida Representative and they
came up empty handed too.  Now - if an individual gets a DUI in Florida and
does all the requirements -- they only get suspended for 6-months to a year
and maybe one years probation for the same exact offense.  We asked his
probation officer are they driving and he said they get their license
normally the day of sentencing so they can get to their jobs -- but he has
not been able to drive legally for more than 3-years now!  He still has his
current Texas DL -- but it is cancelled -- this is his only form of ID.  He
had to fight to even get into college as a FL Resident -- because he did not
have a Florida DL.  He can't advance at work because he does not have a DL.
There is so much more -- He needs your intervention.  The laws prevent him
from getting a drive to work privilege because his offense is in another
state -- but yet anyone who gets the same here -- they are driving to work
and not losing their jobs or their self esteem.  He needs your help -
PLEASE.  This is Urgent -- he could lose his job now and even his probation
officer will not assist.  I will and can show you evidence of all of this.

I realize you have an extremely difficult task balancing the state budget.  As an educator I urge you to support appropriate funding for our state museum, the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art.  This wonderful cultural jem is appreciated by people in Florida as well as nationally and internationally.  It attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists and that brings revenue to the local economy and to the state. I know that in these difficult economic times, the taxes paid by these tourists are especially important. I urge you to oppose the purposed $2.25 million dollar budget cut.  This museum should be an institution that makes every person in Florida proud.
Thank you for your kind attention.

Dear Governor Bush,

I thought you'd like to know what people say about Ms. Judy Belcher.  She's a detriment to you as well as my loved one.

COMMENTS FROM  FAMILIES  OF INMATES  REGARDING THE UNPROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOR OF  JUDY BELCHER.

A young woman new to the "system" wrote in that Ms. Belcher really wanted to help her husband get proper medical attention, if she would only send her the name of the inmate and the prison he's at she'd be glad to help her.  Then comments began pouring in concerning Ms. Judy Belcher.  I've copied and pasted a few of the comments below:

FIRST COMMENT:
If this person expects anything from Ms. Belcher she can forget it. This 
woman doesn't care anything about the inmates or their familes. She has 
endangered my loved one's life several times by forwarding infromation directly to the prison...J.W.

NEXT COMMENT:
DITTO on the bitch Judy Belcher. She's nothing but a do-girl for DOC.
Alway has been, always will be. Never got a damn thing from her but BS.
"C"

NEXT COMMENT:
Judy Belcher's an airhead collecting a paycheck up there in Tallahassee and doesn't give a rats a**  about inmates or their familes...!   Thomas G.

NEXT COMMENT:
that woman never helps anyone, she's always asking for names of inmates to give to the  institution so the institution knows which inmate is leaking information about the inhumane acts going on inside the prison.  CJ

NEXT COMMENT:
Ms Belcher's  one of the most unprofessional employees (with the exception of those who beat valdes to death) I've encountered at FL  DOC. I figure she got her job the old fashioned way by sleeping up the ladder...SW

NEXT COMMENT:
Dear _____ please beware of Ms. Belcher.  She doesn't want your inmates name to help him.  If you give her the inmates name, then the prison he's at will retaliate upon him.  I know this from personal experience. Ms. Belcher's a female hinchman  and YES-girl for DOC.   I seriously doubt the woman even has a business degree because I don't know of any Business School in the world that would teach the UNPROFESSIONAL ethics this woman uses.  She probably got her job by WHO she knew..."Fay"

Thank you Colin. I think that the unemployment comp system is based on who is laid off, not for those who leave their job voluntarily. If we added those to the mix, the premiums would be very high. Am I wrong?

Dear Governor Bush
My name is Colin Reynolds a resident of Saint Pete for the last 10 years.  This is not about me, however I have some serious issues with the unemployment compensation program.  My friend Gail Edman lives down the street from me, and she switched jobs last October for a better opportunity.  Gail has worked her whole life never collecting any type of unemployment and when her latest opportunnity fell through because the company she went to has not paid her, and they are also located in Canada.  She filed for unemployment about three weeks ago, and yesterday Tuesday March 4th was her claim date.  She received notice today that because she left her last job in October on her own, that she was not going to be accepted for the unemployment program.  Something is wrong here, the state of Florida takes care of everyone who don't work, and here is a person who has run out of options.  Please contact me.  I've been out of work myself and have my own issues with unemployment, but again this letter is not about me.  Please help.
   I received your email from Ted Webb at 970WFLA here in Tampa.  Please pull some strings for her.  
THANKS
GOD BLESS AMERICA

Dear Governor Bush:  I applaud your State of the State message.  It was both insightful and timely.  As your CTC (Community Transportation Coordinator) representative to the Commission for the Transportation Disadvantaged (CTD), I must ask you to offer assistance in deleting sections 29 and 30 (i.e., which reference Chapter 427) of the above referenced PCB.  This appears to be a Medicaid assault on the very non-emergency transportation program that provided over 48 million trips to medical appointments, educational facilities, and nutritional sites.  The 9,049 employees of the different transportation companies delivered over 138 million miles of service to these elderly, disabled, and poverty-level residents.  These are the folks that need our non-emergency tranportation services the most.  When I hear Mr. Bob Sharpe (Medicaid) talk about eliminating this needed service, he fails to mention that these poor folks will be calling 911 for ambulance transport.  A short ambulance trip of $650 can be provided just about anywhere in the state by a non-emergent vehicle four times cheaper.  What a savings for the taxpayer!  Anyway, I appreciate your time.  Please, help us protect our seniors and most vulnerable population.  If I can offer any assistance whatever, please do not hesitate to call.  I'll be there.  Sincerely, John Stanley, CCTM, CTC Rep, Jackson County CTC, state delegate to Wash, DC, and Bay County resident (whew!)

Dear Mr. Governor,

During the past year I have had the misfortune to have to experience a
lay-off twice and have spent only two of the past 12 months in any type
of
"real" employment. the sad thing is that I come from the "Professional"
ranks, have a Master's Degree in Management and in Human Resources
Development and a Bachelors degree in Communication. I have over ten
years
of experience in Training and Human Resources Development and ten years
experience in security and Law Enforcement but can't seem to find work.

During both lay-offs I have tried using Workforce Central Florida for
job
leads and as an advocate. Thus far I have received little assistance.

Please know that I understand there are a lot of individuals in similar
circumstance as I, and that their job at Workforce Central Florida is
not to
"get me a job" but rather assist in the ordeal. The concern I have is
that
the representatives I have used seem to have a preoccupation with the
fact
that they are reorganizing and that they too might not have jobs soon. I
have also heard these individuals refer to themselves or their
associates as
being "ROAD" (Retired on Active Duty). Another issue was that one of
these
representatives did call  me to let me know that I should be hearing
from a
couple of possible employers. After four days of hearing nothing I
emailed
the representative to let him know. This representative then called me
and
berated me for being impatient - He asked that I give him time to work.
Several weeks later now, I still have yet to hear from the potential
employer or receive feedback from the representative without me having
to
track him down.

Mr. Governor, I don't want to complain but I am now VERY concerned about
how
I'm going to take care of my family. This concern is compounded when I
go to
the State Agency that is supposed to be assisting me seems to be doing
nothing.  From my perspective, this organization needs to be evaluated
and
should be operated like a commercial or private Employment
Agency/Headhunter
organization. Employees should be compensated based on performance and
then
possibly, these guys just might refocus and work for their
clients/customer.

I am not writing to solicit employment within this agency but rather
express
my concerns, BUT with that said - If you need someone to step in and
clean-up, I just happen to be available.

Most sincerely,

Michael Chambers

Subject:	Florida State Budget Cuts and the Ringling Museum of Art

Governor, Representatives, and Senators,
 
    

    All Floridians, especially those of us who are transplants, desire that this great state enter the twenty-first century as a leader in all sectors – education, health care, support to the underprivileged and deprived, security, police and fire protection, and culture.  If we have to pay for this – so be it.  It is our future and the only way Florida can succeed in building a secure and employable workforce to attract revenue-enhancing businesses and an educated well-rounded population.  

 

    We oppose draconian tax cuts and sending back the class size and high-speed rail amendments to the voters.  

 

    While you will be hearing from many deserving organizations and sectors of our Florida community, as a member of the Ringling Members Council and a Museum docent we wish to focus on the Ringling Museum of Art.  It is the jewel of culture in Florida’s crown.  It ranks in the top twenty art galleries in the country and has gained world recognition (See the 15 Feb 03 Issue of the UK Spectator, page 42 -http://www.spectator.co.uk <http://www.spectator.co.uk/>  ).  The Ca d' Zan - the Ringling's Florida residence - surely ranks as one of America's greatest stately homes.  The Museum houses one of the great world-class collections of Renaissance and Baroque art.  Its new circus museum will truly be the 'Greatest Show on Earth' for circus museums. 

 

    Although the Ringling expects to welcome 100,000 more visitors this year than last (A 25% increase since 2000) and the staff and volunteers are working extremely hard to meet the State and FSU's matching challenge to obtain $10 million in additional grant money, a cut of $2.25 million - a quarter of our operating budget - would devastate the Museum's ability to function.  

 

    We oppose the proposed cut of $2.25 million in the Ringling's operating budget and any money from trust funds that have been earmarked for cultural institutions like the Ringling.  We urge you not to cut these funds.

 

    Sincerely, Jim and Phyllis LeTellier

Subject:	Constitutional Amendments

Senator King-Jim: I recognize that this will be a difficult legislative
year. However if an effort is not made to allow the public to make informed
decisions about constitutional amendments the future of our state will be
ham strung by decisions which were made without benefit of the true costs.
Clay County, as you may know by now, just rejected an increase in the sales
tax to pay for new schools and there is no support for an increase in the ad
valorem tax which is maxed out. Jim, the cost of the two amendments can be
calculated accurately and may be the voters of each county should be allowed
to decide if they want to increase thier own taxes to lower the class room
size or to pay for high speed rail. I suspect that you and I both know that
each would fail if citizens knew an accurate, not politically determined
cost. Don't limit the resources that will be available to next generation of
Floridians who may be closer to cures for other problems which face our
state than we are now. Give my best to Linda and I hope you'll visit after
the session.

Read today that China is actively courting high tech US Chinese with venture capital dollars to return home to build businesses there.     Don’t know the demographics of Florida, but from what I’ve read, many tech startups are started by Asians.    Could we see many critical asian job creators returning to their home country, providing us with product, but not with jobs?

 

And could there be enough out-migration to have a serious effect on high wage jobs throughout the US.   (I read in San Jose / Santa Clara area, 30% of all businesses were started by asian immigrants)

Subject:	School class size

March 6, 2003

Dear Mr. Portilla,

Thank you for your services in our county. I would like to state my views on
our school classroom size.

We are very concerned about the amount of children per classroom in the
Dade County school system.  I am fortunate enough to have my first grader in
West Lab school which is associated with the University of Miami.  I feel
that West Lab has hand picked a group of wonderful teachers.  We, as parents
have donated money in order to keep aides in the classroom.  That's
something that we all feel is a necessity when the classrooms are filled
with up to 34 students with one teacher.  The aides are shared between two
classes.

Jeb Bush has stressed the importance of FCAT testing and the facts that
children will not go forward if they do not test well.  I don't believe that
children can learn in an environment that is overcrowded.  This observation
is based on my own daughter.  She has been labeled as gifted as far as IQ.
I, as a working mother, read at least 10 books a week to her (since she was
born) and have given her all learning opportunities, including reading camp
at UM in the summer. She also has been enrolled in the Kumon Learning system
for three months, which is an after school extra reading and math course.

I'm not trying to raise an over-achiever by any means, but when my own child
comes to me and worries because she doesn't feel comfortable with her
reading abilities, then I think there's a problem.  If it wasn't for the
fact that a University student comes in once a week to tudor her, I don't
feel that she would be able to get any individual attention in her
classroom.  Her teacher, who I have a great respect for, has been out with
personal days at various times of the year. That happens to everyone, but
it's my observation that there isn't one substitute that can control the
classroom in her absence.  It's not that they are bad teachers, it's that
the class size is too large.

If you and Mr. Bush are truly concerned with education in our state, I feel
that you should put all efforts forth that the classroom size reduction law
isn't vetoed.  The money should be allocated toward more teachers and higher
wages for teachers and aides.  When education fails at such an early stage,
the effects on society must be tremendous.

Dear Mr. Jeb Buch this is Taimira from Miramar Garden and Vista Verde.

im writing this letter to you to thank you for all your help. with out your help

i would not have had an attorney. i got a continues for agusto 6 and it was 

a battle in court to get the continues but the judge gave it to me. these attorneys

are very good and they are so understanding. but im so happy that they realised that 

every thing that i told you and them was all true and that the corruption in miami is out 

of this world. there was another lady that was suppost to go to court on last friday. but even 

though this so called church called universal truth center.  told timberlake and their attorney

that they would pay the arears of this lady they still said that they would take her to court and

foreclose. but something funny happend and it really worrys me because the people from that 

church,  called her and told her not to go to the hearing. but as you know if you dont show up in 

court they will foreclose and that is it. well this church told her that glazer their attorney had sent 

them a letter, but she does not have any idea what the letter said or nothing. but it worrys me because

i no we are dealing with delinquents and they are capable of telling her not to go and then they show 

up in court and foreclose her house, the church said that they were going to meet on monday. so

i hope that she could bring me the letter to see what this letter said. and im praying that they did not treak

her. they lady is to old to be on the street. she was in tears when i got to her house and told her that i 

would go to court with her . im not an attorney but governer i just have to try. i have lost my streanth when 

i think that thing are going good i receive another news it happens that timberlake is ready to run they are going to 

desapear and justice will not be done. they claim that in september there would be another management company

and that they are going to charge $ 65.00 my governer people hear cant pay $ 35.00 how could they pay $ 65.00

plus that would breake our by laws. so now its like starting all over again. Mr. Governer how could stranger come to a 

community and harm us for 4 long year why would they do this. every department like IRS and fdle and better buisiness

bural and florida bar they all take so long to act that by that time. these people are going to run. and that is what 

they always have done. i hope that my attorneys would take all the cases in this community and that they 

can help all the community because we all need help. we are despert. when these elder find out that they are going 

to raise the association to $ 65.00 they are going to get a heart attack. my friend this is just to much we really need

to get rid of this association problem for ever we need dade county to incoporated us or something. 

Dear Governer im so hurt i feel that they have stolen 4 years of my life. they called me for a jury trial and i dont want to go

between dade county and judge simon and that so called church have taken my faith, since they sent me that letter for the

jury trial i cant sleep im scared that justice would not be done and that they would condem a inocent. im really scared

i dont think that i would be good for that , but one thing i could tell you Mr. Bush im so happy that you are the 

governer and i cant stop thanking the lord for you. but i wanted to thank you my self. because you are awesome thank you

i hope you could respond i would feel so good if you wrote me a little note. please if you know how i could hurry

these department to start acting fast before these people run. if you could give them a little call they would understand 

that we need help and we are willing to give information so that justice would be done. im waiting for a call from the better 

buisiness bural but this lady carrera told me that she would call me a week ago and i have called her i dont know how many 

times but she does not call me. and this is the person that has my case for over 5 month. we cant wait we need urgent 

investigation, well Mr. Bush if you could help me in this please let me know, they are going to run, and they will change

the name to their corporation and they will continiue lying to the state and giving them insufficient fund check like they have 

for over $ 8,0000 dollar and the state has done nothing to get them. why ? if state of florida know that they are delinquent

why do they continiue to open their corporation, well Mr. Buch i now that you are to busy but i needed to talk to you

Dear Governor Bush,
 
My name is Tom Hanlon and I am a public defender for the Sixth Judicial Circuit in Dade City Fl.  I am writing on behalf of William "Bud" Hallman, one of the three names submitted to you. I first meet Bud about ten years ago when he left his dad's Boca Raton law firm to become a prosecutor for the Fifth Judicial Circuit working in the Brooksville office.  I remember the first  impression  I  formed about Bud was that he was a man of his word and that his word was as good as gold. I was impressed with the respect and dignity that Bud extended to all he  came in contact with.  During the course of our case I learned that  Bud had managed and worked his family's cattle ranch and professionally rodeoed prior to law school.  Bud's background and the fact that I manage and run our familys  cattle ranch made for a fast and enduring friendship. During the course of our friendship I have  realized that Bud  stays current on all the latest case law via the web as well as publications. When Bud left the state attorneys office, my wife  Connie and our son TJ began socializing with Bud, his wife Cathy, and their two daughters Amanda and Rebecca. My wife and I count it as a blessing having friends like the Hallman's.   Bud's daughter Rebecca, is the only person other than my mother to ever watch over my son TJ in our absence. When you meet Bud's family you realize that Bud is a good husband and a fine dad, just the thing this country needs more of.  Bud has a work ethic that is second to none and would make you proud. Over the years, whenever I needed help working cows, Bud was there.  Whenever I had an employee who need legal help Bud was there free of charge.
If you want a person you can be proud of, it is Bud.   If you want a person who works hard like you, it is Bud. If you want a person that does what he thinks is right, regardless, like yourself, it is Bud. As you can see, I strongly recommend Bud Hallman and encourage you to appoint him to the circuit bench.

REPRESENTATIVE CONNIE MACK PRAISES GOVERNOR BUSH’S

STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS

-- Governor Bush gave a great speech and Florida is on the right track --

 

Ft. Lauderdale – Representative Connie Mack (R-Ft. Lauderdale) issued praise today for Governor Jeb Bush’s 2003 State of the State address.

 

            “I am proud of Governor Bush.  He gave a great speech, and Florida is on the right track,” said Representative Mack.  “I share his common-sense economic growth ideas that will help Florida’s economy rebound.  We need to continue focusing on the economy and growing the job market.”

 

            “Additionally, I admire Governor Bush’s economic leadership.  He has demonstrated great foresight in regards to the high speed rail and class size amendments, and he understands that sound fiscal policy is linked to sound ideas,” added Representative Mack.  “The high speed rail and class size amendments are both admirable ideas; however, the timing is just not right.

That is wisdom.

Subject:	Good afternoon Governor:

Let me start with saying hello from Adam. Thought you might like to see a little piece of his work.  I am designing a webpage for women.  The intent is to inspire women in business, politics, health, etc. and will be focused on stories, etc. contributed by women all over the country.  Adam has set up the page just for display purposes until I register the domain in the next couple of weeks.  Some of the contributing women are business owners, a cancer survivor, a yoga instructor, and a woman-owned organization that rescues stray animals and does not euthanize but adopts all strays.   I believe the site will be quite successful.  

I would like to ask your help.  Is it possible that with your experience with my crusading for safer schools in Florida that I could ask you to contribute a one or two sentence statement about my contribution?  Or perhaps a one or two line sentence about any inspiration I may have provided for other women to not be afraid to approach government leaders to seek change?  I know this is asking a lot, but it would certainly inspire women to seek change in all facets of society.  

The site, which is only in its infancy stage, and not registered as a domain is as follows:   www.angelfire.com/pop/adamonline/mary 

I am going to ask you, Kathy Fountain from Fox 13 News in Tampa, and Tedd Webb to contribute.  I will post your statements on the opening page on the lower right side as inspirational introductions.  The remaining links are still under construction.  

Thank you Governor.  This would mean so  much to Adam as well.  I hope you are okay with this request.  I would also like to post the picture of you with Adam and me as well.

Respectfully,

Mary M. Gray

Governor Bush, I am still not sure if that answers my question concerning SDC funding specifically. Would you review my answer from your office and advise?
I am very grateful for the increase, that will mean since only 20% of the mentally ill are currently being served, there is some hope they can be reached.

Thanks for taking the time out of your busy schedule to speak with me. It seems I caught you off guard with my interest in positions in your Administration. Please allow me clarify my intentions; first I am very content in serving President Bush  and making a contribution to his administration. I made a commitment to serve the full first term, if not longer and to help with the reelection. Some weeks ago, my husband had a medical emergency and almost lost his life,  he also is extremely desirous of working at the Dept, of Education in Tallahassee, those events prompted me to consider a return to Florida. Secondly, I wanted to let you know  that  if you needed me I was available. I spoken with my husband and he and I both agree that serving President Bush and helping him get reelected is where my heart is.  Its' unfortunate that you and I don't get  face time, I think I would have better communicated my thoughts. So I hope this message does a better job than my phone conversation.

God Bless,

Here's a thought. Rather than "abolish" the
amendment how about "perfecting" it and
"focusing" it by modifying it so it is only
applicable to K-2. This proposal would have
a two barreled impact:
                1) Its compatible with current research
                2) Budget impact is reduced by
                     a factor of 4.
If given the appropriate charge a group of
responsible educators (Deans of  SUS Colleges of
Education) would probably come up with a similar
solution.

Re: Implement a Foster Parent Policy consistent with Florida Law.
 
Dear Governor Bush:
 
Although Florida Statutes §63.042 prohibit a homosexual from being an 
adoptive parent, the Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) has 
yet to implement a homosexual foster parent policy in harmony with Florida 
law. 
 
DCF’s lack of a homosexual foster parent policy consistent with Florida 
Statutes §63.042 is not only creating grave potential harm for the foster 
children of our state, but it is directly responsible for creating the 
unfortunate situation where a child has to be removed from the care of a 
homosexual foster parent who later desires to adopt this child.
 
Furthermore, DCF’s failure to implement a legally consistent homosexual 
foster parent policy is directly undermining Florida Statutes §63.042, now 
being challenged in the Federal courts by homosexualist extremists who 
deliberately ignore that adoption is a privilege, not a right, and that the 
State of Florida has the right to establish foster parent as well as adoption 
criteria.
 
Why is DCF giving children to homosexual foster parents when Florida law 
prohibits homosexuals from ever becoming adoptive parents? If the state has 
acknowledged the dangers, disadvantages, and potential harm that can be 
suffered by a child who falls into the hands of a homosexual via the adoption 
process, why is the state giving a child to a homosexual via the foster 
parent process? Is this is not unconscionable? Is this not incredibly 
irresponsible? Does this not undermine respect for Florida law and erode 
public confidence in the Florida Department of Children and Families?
 
DCF must not permit this situation to fester. DCF must demonstrate more 
regard for the health and welfare of Florida’s orphaned children. It must act 
in total harmony with Florida Statutes and promote respect for the laws of 
our state. 
 
Please, Governor Bush, correct this situation immediately. We, the citizens 
of Florida, but most especially the orphaned/foster children in DCF’s care, 
urgently await your immediate action. This situation must not be allowed to co
ntinue. Let us know if there is anything we can do to help you. Thank you for 
your prompt attention to our request.
 
Very truly yours,

Jamie and I are proud to share this news with you.  In a special celebration today, Foresters announced and honored our son, Christopher, as the 2003 Forester's Champion Child for Florida.  Chris will join other Forester Champion Children in Washington to meet with the president!  He is thrilled to be honored in this manor. 

 

As most of you know, Chris was in a terrible car accident over a year ago and faced brain surgery, as well as months of rehab.  Today he is doing great, is an active junior at Episcopal High School and is already looking forward to getting away to college in just over a year.

 

Many of you were supportive following Chris's accident and we want to again thank you for your thoughts and prayers.  Chris's recovery is a miracle and it would not have been possible without his inner drive and all the support we received.  Of course, the tremendous staff at Shands Hospital had a lot to do with his recovery as well!

 

This event is sponsored by Foresters, a non-profit financial services organization that contributes all of its profits annually to children's charities.  We would also like to thank Foresters for the support they gave to the Children's Miracle Network, and we also want to thank so many of you who were there for Chris and our family.

I often get request from attorneys who have survived the judicial nominating committees and ask for my recommendations.  as you know I served on the 18th judicial nominating committee for several years.  I have been asked by Mark Randall to recommend his candidacy for the eighteeth and by Rick Janca for the 5th out of volusia county.  I know both of these attorneys and I can highly recommend them to you.  Ric is an assistant united states attorney here in the middle district with whom I have handled many many cases.  Mark randall is an attorney here in seminole who has alot of common sense and would be a great judge I have known him for years.    I know you get alot of rec0mmendations  so I thought I would give these to you.  thanks tony

I had dinner with Daniel Woodring tonight.  We were talking about
several
things.  I told him meeting Jim Tewey with Dr. Fair last week and my
interest in faith-based issues (my minor is Bible/religion).
Families are the building block of our society. Faith is a crucial
aspect
for families.
         
I wondered what the state was doing in that area, and wanted to let you
know
I have a deep interest in that area and would welcome a change at some
point.
Again, I will serve wherever you need me.  But I want to make a

For the record, I agree wholeheartedly with the findings and recommendations of Ed Easton and the Oversight Board you appointed.  
 
As a close observer of the Miami Dade County School Board construction program for over 20 years, I can attest to the fact that it has been grotesquely and purposely mismanaged for personal political and financial gain. Regretfully, not a word of what I heard at the recent workshop leads me to believe that Merrett or anyone else can fix the situation.
 
As a parent of a child who successfully navigated and graduated from the system, I feel our children deserve better.
 
Please feel free to call on me If I can be of assistance to you.

Governor,
I have been in contact with Theresa on a consistent basis for several
months. The situation has been complicated by the fact that a number of
appointments arranged by Children's Medical Services have resulted in "no
shows" and the mother has arranged care outside of the network without
prior approval.
I have also communicated directly with her son's primary doctor's office
and discovered none of the evaluations for her son included or justified
out of state treatment. The primary reason is that the care/treatment
determined necessary is available in-state. Regardless, I recognize the
mother is frustrated and advocating for what she believes is best for her
son. Prior to my departure from AHCA I asked her primary doctor to have
her son evaluated at Shands or All Children's Hospital (depending on the
mother's choice) and to either treat her son or recommend care else where
to resolve this issue. Her son's doctor is now recommending a neuropsych
eval in Miami and according to the mother, plans to recommend treatment at
UCLA. I have coordinated with CMS as well as Children's Mental Health to
see if any other options are available. To date, UCLA is still an option if
the doctor or neuropsych.  recommends such care.  I have communicated with
Theresa several times today and will continue to work with her to try to
resolve her concerns if at all possible. I hate the fact that this has
taken so long, but given the circumstances, it's the best we can do.
Hopefully, if her son recieves the neuropsych eval and the physician writes
a recommendation we can come to closure soon. I'll keep you posted on any
further developments.
Shelly

Again I do appreciate your help but, this is your reply. I realize I am
one little fly. This is the same thing I was told a year ago. My son's
school called me from Miami two days ago and said they were going to
have to hospitalize him, he became "upset" in class and threw a desk. I
may not be the brightest apple on the tree but, I do know when I am
being fooled. If you are unwilling to listen and assist the voters of
your state then I will have to take my cause elsewhere.

Thank You,

VOUCHER REPORT: As Congress now gets down to the real business of
reauthorizing the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA),
supporters of private-school vouchers are touting a little-known Florida
program as a model for improving special education.  Pro-voucher forces are
also backing bills in at least four states-Arkansas, Connecticut, Hawaii,
and Oklahoma-that would create programs patterned after Florida's 1999 McKay
voucher law.  One of the McKay law's most enthusiastic promoters has dubbed
the program the "Florida Miracle," but today People for the American Way
Foundation (PFAWF) and DREDF released a report that debunks this myth,
raising serious concerns about financial abuse and the law's impact on
parents' rights and special education services.

A description and summary of the report follows.  The complete report is
available on the DREDF website: www.dredf.org/vouchers.

Dear Governor Bush:

As the headmaster of the new and unique Sarasota Military Academy, I
wanted 
to share with you the excitement of all the amazing developments at our 
school. We are the nation's only public charter military high school, and
we 
serve 265 students in grades 9-12. Our waiting list approaches 100
students. 
People are asking to sign up years before the child would be old enough to 
attend!

In addition to the full array of course offerings one might expect at the 
high school level, our cadets may select (free of charge) such courses as 
fencing, self defense, sailing, crew, equestrian, drama, dance, yearbook, 
drill and rifle teams, jazz band, chorus, aviation, and so much more.

Every morning formation is entirely led by students. Our 10-12 member band 
plays the National Anthem, the colors are presented, we recite the Pledge
of 
Allegiance, and our bagpipes play a final patriotic salute before students 
are dismissed for classes. It is a sight to behold that I am sure you
would 
find heartwarming and inspirational.  The image of 265 teenagers in full 
military uniform paying tribute to our nation is something our guests do
not 
soon forget.

We are looking forward to our first annual inspection by military
personnel. 
Normally, schools do not even apply to become a Military Unit with 
Distinction until at least their second year of operation. On April 23,
2003 
our students will pass in review in a ceremony that will be marked with 
tradition and precision. We would be honored to have you visit us on this 
day or any other that would fit your busy schedule.

As a major proponent of charter schools, I am confident that you would be 
amazed by our march toward excellence. Our vibrant parent groups are 
energized and active, and I cannot say enough about the accomplishments of 
my dedicated faculty and cadets. Our motto is HONOR--of self, family, 
community and nation. What an honor it would be to have you visit us.
Thank 
you for considering our request. We look forward to welcoming you to our 
campus in the near future.

Respectfully,

Daniel Kennedy, Headmaster
The Sarasota Military Academy

Dear Governor Bush,
I wanted to congratulate you and your staff for the great job of bringing everyone together to discuss economic development issues. Dr. Pam Dana was a huge help with the Lowe's project  and did a great job. 

We have already started a 4 part campaign contacting our existing industries and letting them know we are here to assist them with incentives, training etc.. We are hosting a luncheon on the 16th to discuss QTI and other incentives and also emergency preparedness. We even sent out the latest Workforce Awards applications due tomorrow. We are in the process of  identifying where we best fit in. Biomedical definitely due to Celebration hospital etc.. International- our Hispanic- Puerto Rican community. 

My goal is to also get information out to our small businesses that we do not target but assist through our Small Business Development Center and our Hispanic community. Since I am Cuban we plan on doing some bi- lingual marketing as well. We are working closely with State Rep. John "Q" s office. We want to be proactive not reactive.

Please let me know if I can ever be of service in economic development or with the Hispanic community.

Honorable Jeb Bush, Governor
State of Florida

Dear Governor Bush:

My name is Michael Foreman, and I am a partner of the law firm of Icard, Merrill, Cullis, Timm, Furen & Ginsburg, P.A., Sarasota, Florida.  Our law firm has been working with you in developing better ways of handling adoptions.  Art Ginsburg, Bill Merrill, representatives of the YMCA and others were involved a pilot program.  You may recall that the program was highlighted at a celebration held at the Sarasota Hyatt.  I was honored to be photographed with you, Bill Merrill and LaRue Merrill (his mother) after those meetings.  

Judi Lee, who is involved in Sarasota County adoption cases, gave me your email address.  At that time, I told you of my spiritual walk and told you that I and another attorney whose name is Bill Scovill would be committed to pray for you and your brother, George W. Bush, during your entire tenures as Governor of Florida and President of the United States, respectively.  We have been doing that at approximately 5:15 every morning Monday through Friday.

I am a member of Sarasota Baptist Church and the Chairman of the Deacons there.  One of the ministries of our church is Evangelism Explosion and, in particular, the EE Prison Ministry of Art Hallett.  I have attached to this email a document in Word format which gives an overview of the prison ministry.  Art Hallett is an ordained minister and is under the supervision of EE International which is headed by Dr. D. James Kennedy of Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.  More information about EE International and Art Hallett's prison ministry are on the EE International website which is:  http://www.eeinternational.org

Each year the prison ministry has a banquet which is currently scheduled for May 31, 2003.  We know you have a busy schedule but because we also know of your abiding interests in faith-based initiatives, you might consider speaking at our event.  We had 400 people in attendance last year and are expecting over 500.

We can send you other brochures and materials which show the effectiveness of this prison ministry not only in the State of Florida but in other states as well.  Please prayerfully consider this request and let us know if you would be available to be our keynote speaker.  May God richly bless you and your family! 

Yours in Christ,

Mike Foreman

Gov. Bush,
 
I'm working on a positive story and I'm not too proud to say that this is always a frightening and unsettling experience. I'd feel better if you were part of it.
 
The story is about private employers providing compensatory pay (aka differential pay) to activated reservists and National Guard members. Your past statements indicated a willingness to use your bully pulpit to encourage them to explore this option and I think this story provides the perfect vehicle for you to do that as Commander in Chief of Florida's National Guard.
 
Be advised, I've already run this by your press team and gotten their blessing for this note to you.
 
As a former business writer, I'm focusing on several business angles. They include interviews with a Florida executive who provides compensatory pay and talks about why he does. I've also interviewed John Challenger, CEO of the Challenger, Gray & Christmas outplacement firm. Here's what he had to say:
 
... Providing compensatory pay is good business, according to John Challenger, CEO of the international outplacement firm of Challenger, Gray & Davis. Companies are looking for ways to boost employee morale and demonstrate corporate loyalty in the wake of the recent ethics scandals which have rocked Wall Street, he said, and providing compensatory pay does both. 

"It's certainly a contrast in this era of cost-cutting to see so many companies stepping up in support of employees who are putting their lives on the line," Challenger said. "We often don't think of corporations as being good citizens anymore, but they're doing exactly that by taking matters into their own hands and providing compensatory pay. It's a win-win situation for everyone." ...

So, I think you will find yourself in good company in this story. My question is "why was compensatory pay the right thing for the State of Florida in 2001, when lawmakers passed the Military Service Compensation Law, and why is it the right voluntary move now for large private employers ?"

If you can get back to me with  a response by Friday morning, I'd sure appreciate it.

Respectfully,

Victor Epstein,

JEB,
I don't know if you remember me, I was one of the people you talked to in Green Cove Springs during the preliminary research for your first run for Governor. I have been intimately involved in all of your campaigns and was a charter member of the FFF. I have never asked you for anything other than to follow your heart and do what is best for Florida, I know you are the person who has the strength of character to "Do The Right Thing".
 
It is because of my experiences with you during your campaigns and my firm belief that you a man of strong Character who believes in Family Values and love of family that I am asking for your assistance.
 
My daughter and Son-In-Law  (Bill and Michelle Curtis, Keystone Heights , Fl.) are Foster Parents and have been for over three years. They have been an  "Emergency Shelter" Foster Family all of that time and have provided a loving home for over 30 children (mostly small children or babies) for a short period of time. During their tenure as Foster Parents they have been Blessed with being allowed to adopt the first of the Foster Babies (Desiree') when she was a little over a year old. I will always remember as we walked out of the Judge's Chambers, the receptionist congratulated Bill and Michelle and our precious little Desiree' held up her pretty little arms with her palms up and said "All Done", there wasn't a dry eye in the group!
 
I now need your help to ensure that another baby doesn't "Fall through the cracks of the System". Her name is Jessica M. Koon, the 4th Judicial District In Duval County (Jacksonville).
                   
She has been at Michelle and Bill's home since she was 4 days old, they took her home from the Hospital. During a court hearing the alleged father was "Dismissed from the case" by the Judge because of his claim of not being Jessica's father. Subsequently the Biological Mother signed over her "Parental Rights". During the "Staffing for Permanency" the Attorney for DCF insisted that they again contact the alledged Biological Father (who is now in prison) even tho the Judge had dismissed him from the case.
 
 This is a travesty against the sensibilities of loving and caring people throughout Florida. Why would these attorneys insist on talking to a convicted Felon about parently rights when he has absolved himself from the case and has been dismissed by the judge because of his denial of Paternity.
 
This man, a convicted drug user, now, for some unknown reason, thinks he should have rights to a baby he denied in court, has provided no support for and has had absolutely no contact with. 
 
This baby needs your help. This situation is one that attacks the very roots of "The Family Unit". Jessica knows only my Daughter (Michelle) as Mommy, my Son-In-Law (Bill) as Daddy and my wife and I as Grandma and Poppa. I don't want to see a baby put at risk by the state by attempting to transfer custody to someone who has been convicted of and is in prison for drug use, ( By the way when Jessica was born she tested positive for Cocaine - she was a "Crack Baby" and this man was living with her mother up until her birth).
 
Please see that Jessica gets justice! 
 
                                                        Respectfully,
                                                        Rick Bebout

Jeb - DCA reasoning is bunk. It is NOT about rezoning. That's not what you are saying. It IS about the instructions given to the appraisers. IF the instructions are "what is the present value of the land, with current use" then the inflated hype should disappear, and that is the basis upon which property is sold in the real world - it's present condition. Just because it may be developed, or zoning provides for it, does NOT mean it will happen, so under present instructions, you are paying for pie in the sky. However, YOU are the Governor, and they work under your direction, so look at the instructions, and order removal of those requirements which cause the problem. Otherwise, the bureaucracy is being the governor. And, it is out of line for bureaucracy to set the policy. That's your job! And, it looks suspicious - are they getting an illegal kick-back?Sheila Anderson  http://tampatrib.com/floridametronews/MGARL7WNZCD.html

Governor Bush

I wanted to make sure you had the results of a recent national poll on
public responsibility for public education by the Public Education Network
(PEN) and Education Week. I have attached a copy of the poll results. And,
on Thursday, March 6, 2003, PEN launched a new web site to give Americans an
opportunity to raise their hands and their voices for quality teachers.

Sincerely,
Wendy D. Puriefoy 
President 
Public Education Network
601 13th Street NW 
Washington, DC 20005

 <<2003 Poll Report Final.pdf>> 



For Immediate Release: March 6, 2003
Contact: Nadia Khatchadourian, 202-478-6187

In the Face of Severe Budget Cuts, Americans Display Overwhelming Support
for Public Education and Tell Policymakers "Good Teachers Are Off Limits"
Through GiveKidsGoodSchools.com Campaign

Washington, D.C. - As states across the country face the harshest budget
deficits in decades, the American public, even in the face of impending war,
strongly supports efforts to make public education work better for America's
kids.  Over 32,000 letters have been sent urging state officials to make
teacher quality a priority by visiting www.GiveKidsGoodSchools.com
<http://www.GiveKidsGoodSchools.com>  and asking for:

*	Incentives for school districts to hire and retain qualified
teachers
*	Good pay, sufficient to support a teacher and his or her family
*	Improved conditions, including lower class size, that promote
effective teaching and learning

"The public expects teachers to be highly qualified - and to be fairly
compensated - for the important work of educating their children," said
Puriefoy.  "GiveKidsGoodSchools.com provides a simple way for individuals to
urge their elected officials to improve the pay, power, prestige, and
preparation of teachers and communicate their views on other key priorities
for strengthening public education."
 
The GiveKidsGoodSchools.com launch is the first facet of a broader campaign
by the Public Education Network to enable individuals to support and demand
high-quality public education for all children in America.  The
GiveKidsGoodSchools.com campaign gives parents, educators and other
concerned citizens the information and tools they need to demand a good
teacher for every child in public school.  As a new component of the
campaign, GiveKidsGoodSchools.com has just added information to help parents
ask questions of their child's principal, local school board, and state
elected officials to find out what kind of teachers are teaching their kids.


Last week, PEN (the parent organization of GiveKidsGoodSchools.com) and
Education Week released a national poll demonstrating that voters put
protecting and strengthening education above their concerns about health
care, terrorism, national security, social security, and job creation.  The
poll also found that by a nearly 2-to-1 margin, Americans say that raising
teacher quality is the greatest priority to improve education. 

"The American public has voiced their opinion loud and clear - they expect
lawmakers to put good teachers in the classroom, and to provide the support
teachers need to succeed," said Wendy D. 

- more -

Puriefoy, president of PEN.  "The thousands of Americans who have already
taken action at GiveKidsGoodSchools.com have put lawmakers on notice that
they will be held accountable by their constituents for their commitment to
teaching in their states. They must live up to their campaign promises."

The public's strong support for education is especially significant given
today's political climate, where across the nation, state budgets are in
their worst crisis in 50 years.  In addition, states are scrambling to meet
the demands of the new federal No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), which
mandates that all teachers teaching core academic subjects be
highly-qualified by the end of the 2005-06 school year.  The PEN/Education
Week poll found that Americans strongly support NCLB, but are concerned that
schools will need more money to meet its requirements. Voters say that the
federal government - not the states - should provide the necessary funds to
fully implement the law. 

"Any lawmaker who makes it harder to put good teachers in the classroom,
especially because of budget cuts, better be ready to explain to voters why
their kids aren't getting what they need to succeed," said Puriefoy. 

The PEN/Education Week poll found that to improve teacher quality, virtually
all Americans (94 percent) would require all middle and high school teachers
to have a degree in the subject they teach.   Yet 44 percent of middle
school students nationwide, and more than half of students in high-poverty
middle schools, take a class with a teacher who hasn't acquired even a minor
in the subject, according to "Quality Counts 2003," a publication of
Education Week released last month.

The poll also found that three in five voters (59 percent) say they believe
that it is possible to have a qualified teacher in every classroom by the
year 2005, but note that low teacher salaries (39 percent) present the
biggest obstacle to achieving this goal.  A teacher in his or her twenties
makes about $8,000 less per year than other college-educated professionals.
The gap widens to $24,000 for teachers age 44-55, and climbs to a $32,000
difference for those with master's degrees.

		Public Education Network (PEN) is a national organization of
local education funds (LEFs) and individuals working to improve public
schools and build citizen support for quality public education in
communities across the nation. PEN believes public engagement is the
oft-missing ingredient in school reform, and that the level of public
involvement ultimately determines the quality of education provided by
public schools.  Its mission, therefore, is to build public demand and
mobilize resources for quality public education through a national
constituency of organizations and individuals. PEN and its 78 LEF members,
who work in 30 states and the District of Columbia on behalf of 10.6 million
children in more than 1,200 school districts, seek to bring the community
voice into the debate on quality public education in the firm belief that an
active, vocal constituency will ensure every child, in every community, a
quality public education.  To learn more about this coalition and its
efforts to generate public support for education, log on to

This was in today's Palm Beach Post in an article about the new Florida quarter. 






Bush said he voted for the Everglades design, but "it was a tough decision." 


Teachers were encouraged to get their students involved in the voting. 


"My guess is it was our students who ended up making the ultimate decision, which I think is pretty cool," Bush said. 




On a personal note, I think, as Governors go, you're pretty cool yourself.  Just to follow up with you on my previous email regarding the disbursement of funds for Naranja Lakes condominium after Hurricane Andrew - I don't know what you did, but evidently it worked.  My mother received her check two days ago, much to her delight.  After waiting for over ten years to finalize this, it was a very welcome surprise.   


I hope that all is well with you, and that you are continually blessed. Thank you again for your help in getting the problem with the condo addressed.

Dear Sirs, 
 
Just wanted to send you a short e-mail with a great big THANK YOU, because you 3 and the folks at H.C.I., just made a very sick man extremely happy!!! I called my husband after getting off the phone with Ms. Gavin at H.C.I to inform him of John's upcoming visit, and he was so happy that he started crying with joy!! You can not possibly know, and words seem to escape me at the moment, to tell you how grateful I am for your efforts in this matter. I can only tell you that I will hold all of you in my prayers that God will so richly bless your lives, as you have just blessed ours. 
 
Eternally grateful, I remain, 
 
Sincerely,  Carol Glancy
 
PS. I had not mentioned that just a couple days ago Bob was talking about John, and cried when he said that he did not think that he would ever get to see John again - now he has something to look forward to.

Subject: The Writing of a Sefer Torah



Dear Governor Bush,

            My name is Layne Batt and I'm a video Producer working in Boca Raton, Florida.  Rabbi Schneur Oirechman, our Chabad Representative here in Tallahassee, has had the honor for the past three years of having you light the Menorah candles during our Chanukah celebration;  what a wonderful example for our Jewish community, state-wide to see.

I've been working in Television for over 25 years beginning at WSVN in Miami and then onto “America's Most Wanted,” NBC,  MTV’s “Real World” and many other fulfilling productions and production companies.  The diversification of my skills has offered me many opportunities to producer, photograph and edit all kinds of programs.

            In fact, in a way I'm working for the State of Florida right now: this will be the 2nd year, that I'll be producing & editing 4 more commercials for “Florida's Fish & Wildlife Commission” in coordination with “Sportsmen's Adventure's” which airs on the Sunshine Network, throughout the state.  

            The project I'm working on presently is for The Shul of Bal Harbour, located in the town of Surfside, just north of Miami Beach.  This is a very special Jewish Temple, with a large, Philanthropic congregation that has brought this area into a new realm of Jewish observance.  This Shul is also under the auspices of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneerson, O.B.M., whose blessings and leadership have brought Chabad Lubavitch to World Wide recognition, with over 3,000 organizations around the globe.

            This year we have commissioned the writing of a Sefer Torah; it will be the first Torah ever written in the State of Florida from “Start to Finish.”  Customarily, a Sofer  (the person who writes the Torah Scrolls by hand, letter by letter - and there are over 350,000 letters in the Torah) writes only part of the Torah, where he is commissioned to write it, and then returns to Israel where the majority of the writing is completed.

This is a wonderful event taking place in our Shul, and I’ve been given the honor to produce this very personal video.  It’s commencement began on the one-year Anniversary of 9-11, 6 months ago and will be completed in another 4 months. 

We would be very grateful to have you speak to us on camera for a few minutes about this very special and historical event for our Shul and our community.  We will be enlightening a world wide community of Jews with this video, having you say a few words would mean a great deal to us - it would solidify our community and also give closure to the tragedy of 9-11. 

 

Respectfully yours,

Layne (Laizer) Batt

Producer/Director

Dear Fellow Orange Bowl Committee Members:

I am writing to urge you to support Coleman Edmunds for election to our

I have worked closely with Coleman in his role as Counsel, Officer and
Director to AutoNation, Inc. and its over 300 subsidiaries.  

I have been most impressed with Coleman's role in turning around the
Fort Lauderdale Film Festival in his role as director.  

Coleman is very familiar with both Broward and Dade communities.  He
and his wife Cristina and their 3 girls live in Coral Gables.  He is the
son-in-law of one of our members, Cristina Mendoza.  

Coleman is the type of energetic, hardworking, and committed individual
who would be a great addition to the OB committee.

If any of you need additional information or would like to speak about
Coleman, please call me at (305) 599-2337 ext. 815.

I appreciate your past support of the TD Program and its impact on the lives of disabled citizens, seniors, and the disadvantaged. We will continue to need your support this year because the House Health Committee is exploring (on Medicaid spending issues and they should), but they've also included the TD trust fund as well as the coordinated system. 
 
While this was obviously not part of your agenda this year, please keep your legislative team informed of the importance of the TD system and the possible threat from PCB 03-02. 
 
Again, I appreciate your leadership and continued support on issues related to our disabled, seniors, and disadvantaged citizens.

Subject:	How long has The Withlacoochee River Excursions, Inc. existed? 
Attachments:	bground.jpg; inqban.gif; corinq.gif; corhelp.gif

Dear Secretary Struhs-I am concerned about the operation bid submitted by this Corporation for the operation-management of Madison Blue Springs Park.  Your staff has been to my location more than several times over the last 7 years.  About 3 years ago, I met with Mike Bullock over similar issues dealing with large capital spending by Parks in Hamilton County and similar issues.  None of my questions were answered.  Apparently, Park staff wants to keep business on the east bank of the Suwannee and Withlacoochee Rivers.   According to the bid submitted by this business (the Withlacoochee River Excursions, Inc.), it has been operating for 2 years.  This has only been a business since January 22, 2003 (less than 2 months in business???).  I have also checked the Hamilton County phone directory and other sources and cannot find this business listed.  Has any of your staff visited this location?  
According to the packet I received there would be up to 20 points awarded for years in business and 30 points awarded on responses to the 6 sections of the business plan.  I never received the 6 points necessary to respond to.  I had 7 days from the time I received this packet to respond by the dead line.  
I am really concerned about some legal issues being raised by others concerned that politics were being played by Steve Yoczik and possibly the whole committee, who reviewed this "bid."  
Now, I again have to re-visit the whole issue and interview and submit to other inconveniences by Park staff.  
This is very politcal and being handled very poorly.  
Didn't any staff think to check that The Withlacoochee River Excursions, Inc. existed for 2 years as they claim?  I have been operating on the Withlacoochee for 7 years and have never seen this business operate on the Withlacoochee.
Please have your staff contact me and send me a list of all members of the committee who recommended giving the bid to this business.  
I have other concerns about the operations and budgets of Parks in the Suwannee Basin.  These I will address later.

Subject: Idea for Fla. Malpractice crisis


My Honorable Governor-Mr. Jeb Bush,

I would first like to introduce myself as we have briefly met in the
past. My name is Marti and I am Brad Thomas' sister (maybe I should
leave that info out...just kidding).

I would like to propose an idea to you that I have formulated in my head
over the last few weeks. I am an RN and I have worked in all realms of
Florida's medical care system. I have been a nurse in a psychiatric
hospital, a nurse working for an MD in private practice, and my current
position as a marketer for a home health care company takes me into many
nursing homes and assisted living facilities.

I give you that background so you will know I am well aware of the
urgency and seriousness of our malpractice dilemma. The idea I would
like to propose to you will not necessarily replace capping malpractice
awards, but it could be a good compromise if the attorneys fight the cap
system altogether. We all know that under our current system that the
physicians and the insurance companies as well as the insured public
have paid a high price to pay out these ludicrous monetary awards. But
the attorneys involved merely fight the case in court and collect their
percentages of millions of dollars.

As you know every physician in the state of fla. contributes a few
hundred dollars each year into a general fund that is utilized to pay
the malpractice premiums for the volatile fields of neurology, labor and
delivery, etc. We also know for a fact that there are truly excessive
medical errors that occur in our hospitals and nursing homes and this
feeds the argument of the high awards, " protecting the health and well
being of our citizens". We also know that our hospitals and nursing
homes are understaffed. The staff members that are still working are
undereducated and overworked, this I know first hand.

Here is my idea. The attorney takes on a malpractice case for a portion
of the award, therefore the claimant has no financial risk by suing, and
their attorney is looking to collect a great deal of money. What if the
legislature proposed a bill that would require all practicing attorneys
that benefit from malpractice awards to contribute a percentage of that
award to a specifically earmarked fund for the state. This percentage
could be quite low, say 2-5%, which should not affect the huge gains for
the law firms involved. Now, the fund would be strictly utilized for
additional staffing at medical centers and nursing homes, as well as
boost the education provided to the staff. When I speak of staff, I am
referring to the RN and down. In other words, to increase the number of
RNs, LPNs, CNAs, and housekeeping. This fund would quickly grow even if
caps are put in place, the percentage must be taken from the attorney's
collection and not from the pain and suffering awards to the patients,.

As I see it, we all would win. Nurses would more than likely return to
their field because they will not be made to feel like slaves with an
overwhelming number of patients to care for, there will be more CNAs to
help keep our patients nourished and clean, housekeeping would be
adequate and understand the paths of infection. Hospital administrators
would love it as well.  I promise you, if this were put into place that
over the fist few months Florida would see quit a reduction in the
number of errors made, and isn't that really our goal, to save lives and
eliminate malpractice opportunities.

I know this has been a very long letter, but please consider this novel
idea and let me know what you think. I think it is time for our Florida
attorney's to put their money where there mouth is as they claim they
need to have high awards, "to protect the citizens of Florida from these
unforgivable medical errors". Some number crunching will quickly show
you that even taking as little as 2-5%, will help many hospitals and
nursing homes operate under more optimal conditions and could save many
lives by reducing hospital born infections and medical errors made by
overworked nurses.

PS Please don't blame Brad, I did not tell him what I was proposing to
you. Just that I had an idea to throw a new spin to this malpractice
debacle that we find ourselves in today!

Sincerely,
Marti Blajian RN

My dear friend and Hon.Gov. Jeb Bush:
I have received an e-mail from a "very dear friend"  Ruth Beckman (which
you can read it below my letter here.  Also, I must say to you that it
really bothers me, her "bad impresion" about the inefficiency of your
administration staff might be "true."

Also, I wrote to you while back about helping Eunice
Garcia, and she has been calling me many times that your designated staffer
Ann Hampton has done "nothing" to help her.
After you read the e-mail sent to me below, Jeb what can I tell these people
who are complaining of not getting help from our Governor????

Take for instance Eunice Garcia! She spent a couple of thousand dollars
working and helping to get you elected. It is not only dollars, it is the
hours she spent working with her hands and her spine, as she does work
making
"kitchen cabinets."These two people have worked so many hours for you, and
here they are now needing "Help!"
Is there any solution to this?
Your loyal friend,
Gladys Levy

I think we can save a little time, if you start your interviews next week with The Withlacoochee River Excursions, Inc.  If they have been in business for 2 years, they can provide you with their tax filings and should.  There is the possibility that the bid could get bogged down due to tax evasion issues.  Steve Yoczic was not very smooth in setting up this little business for his friends.  Still can't figure where Valinda Subic got into this.  Could be the little ongoing anti- Governor agenda at Stephen Foster State Park (Hamilton County).
 
My CPA is Ms Nell Hughes in Statenville, Ga.  She can provide you with my tax filings for the years I have been in business.  You can contact her at 229-559-5756.
 
This rigged bid is pure political retribution for my support for David Struhs and Governor Bush.

Dear Secretary Stuhs
 
After researching the Madison Blue Springs Operation Management Bid process, I think there is cause to turn the whole issue over to the Inspector General's Office.  This would remove any doubt to the public that information provided by the "bidders" was not falsified.  The other issue that should be addressed is whether the deciding committee of State Park employees and their superiors acted appropriately, legally, and without bias.

Subject: YMCA Federal Advocacy week




Governor,

Next week volunteers and staff from YMCAs across Florida will be in
Washington to meet with our representatives to advocate for legislation
that
strengthens children, families and communities.  The Tampa YMCA will be
especially interested in the direction that the Department of Labor will
be
taking with its activities in youth career training, workplace
experience
and career placement.  Currently the US DOL is funding a Youth
Opportunity
Program in Tampa.  This is one of 37 programs nation-wide and the only
one
in Florida.  The YMCA is the lead agency with four significant partners,
the
Boys' and Girls' Club, the Urban League, the East Tampa Development
Corporation and Hillsborough County Schools.  The Tampa program has been
successful on a number of fronts and has been considered one of the best
five programs nation-wide.  

*	Over 1000 fourteen to twenty-one year olds have participated in
tutoring, remediation and GED preparation programs.  

*	Over 300 have participated in college SAT preparation classes.  

*	Over 170 have participated in Occupation Skills Training
classes.  

*	Over 175 have entered College.  

*	The program has exceeded federal enrollment performance targets
by
12.5% by serving over 1800 teenagers with case planning and wrap-around
services.  

*	Over 600 have completed Job Readiness Training.  

*	Over 200 have participated in intern and apprenticeship
programs.  

*	To the point of the program over 850 have been employed.

We realize that the Youth Opportunity Program will sunset either in June
of
2004 or on schedule in June of 2005.  The Tampa community has developed
resources and skills in this area.  We know that the Administration will
develop a program to replace this project.  It seems a shame to
disassemble
this project and loose the resources and acquired abilities.  We request
your Washington Office's assistance with the US Department of Labor to
communicate the value of the current program and the importance of
transitioning the new activities to successful locations that have
developed
the assets to continue the success with difficult and challenged teenage
populations. 

I will be in Washington March 4, 5 & 6 and will have my laptop and cell
phone.  You can reach me by either e-mail at bgilbertson@tampaymca.org
or on
my cell phone at 813-833-9622.  I apologize for the late notice of this
trip
but hope that your office can help in any case.  Thank you for your
continued concern for children and families and support of YMCA
initiatives
that build strong children, families and communities.

Best wishes,  Bob Gilbertson, President & CEO of the Tampa Metropolitan
Area
YMCA.

Subject: "New"Evidence 


Dear Governor Bush, 

My name is Tod Backer, we met at the DeSoto County courthouse last fall,my wife works at the new DJJ facility at GPW, I talked to you about drivers ed in the high schools. I tell you this only to help you know who I am. 
I am writing you tonight about Costitutional Amendments and "new" evidence. I am not a lawyer, I do know that to repeal something, you need to present some kind of new evidence. 
We probably can't find any for the class size amendment, we knew when we voted that we couldn't afford it. 
The High Speed Rail System (HSRS)is another matter completely in my view and I would like you to consider the following reasons I say this. 
When we voted to build the HSRS we did not take into cosideration the enormous cost of providing the security that this system will require. 
The Terrorist threat today is not the same as it was when we passed the HSRS and therefore the voters were unable to make an informed decision. 
We figured on something simular to airport security, (long lines on a HSRS?), but even those costs have skyrocketed since we passed the HSRS because of the new terrorist threat that we face today. 
Security on the train itself would have to be extra tight ($$$). A high speed train going into Orlando with the wrong cargo could be devastating. We didn't have these worries when we voted on the HSRS. 
We also didn't know we would have to provide security on the tracks themselves which I'm not sure we could even do. How do we stop a terrorist from dislodging the track out in the countryside causing a catostrophic train wreck. A threat we would never have imagined when we passed the HSRS. 
I believe that all this represents compelling "new" evidence sufficient to justify a referendom ballot so that the voters can make a more informed decision in the world we live in today. 
Do we really want to build a HSRS if we can't guarantee the safety of it's passengers? 
I personally think that private enterprise should build the HSRS, not the government. There is a reason that private business hasn't done so and I think the voters need to know why. 
Do we really want our government to build a HSRS that the business world thinks has no value? 
If I am talking out of place here you won't hurt my feelings telling me so. I am just passionately opposed the the HSRS. 
With All Due Respect I Am Faithfully Yours'

Subject:	State of Florida expenditures help State of Florida Business



To those of you concerned with the financial well being of our great state,

I am a local business owner in the State of Florida, County of Leon, City of Tallahassee. My firm is a Certified Minority Owned Business Enterprise.

We help to support our community. Our family have been members of the FSU Presidents Club for many years. We have been Golden Chief booster supporters of FSU for many years. We have been FAMU supporters for many years. We are involved in theatre, symphony, and many charity events in our community.

We employ more than 30 registered voters. Our payroll runs nearly $1,500,000 a year.

We are hopeful that at least two of our children will attend college in Florida and we have invested in Florida Prepaid College Fund to ensure that it is made available to them.

We pay more than $45,000 a year in property taxes on a State and Local Level. We collect and remit around $75,000 per year in sales tax for our state. 

I am writing to you because it is disheartening, discouraging, and damaging to business owners in the State of Florida to see our state government award business contracts to out-of-state firms on a regular basis. There seems to be no preference at all given to those of us who you depend upon to fund our state and local governments.

Thursday 3/6 our firm provided a quote for the printing of the FSU Annual Report to the FSU Publications office. It was a competitive telephone bid. When we followed up on the nearly $8,000 bid we found that (amazingly enough) our competitor in the state of Florida who also bid, was only about $65 higher on the quote than we were. Then we found that an out-of-state competitor (in Birmingham, Alabama) was awarded the printing contract because they were $64 lower on their bid than we were.

FSU awarded the bid to the out-of-state printer. 

The printing bid requests that the successful printer make 3 days available for a representative of the FSU Publications office to work with pre-press personnel to make sure that all images provided in the print document are of suitable quality and at optimal settings for the best possible print. It will probably take that amount of time as the FSU employee will have to be out of town for several days. If it were done right here in the city of Tallahassee where FSU is located this process would take no more than 3 hours of that employee's time.

Consider the obvious waste of a state employees time when the State of Florida is firing a record number of its employees in order to get our budget in better shape since the tragic events of 9-11-01. 

Consider the revenue leaving our state to support another.

Consider the employees that I will be laying off in the near future because of the devastating effect of the poor economy that we have all been struggling with for the last two years.

Consider the $1,500,000 in payrolled employees at my firm that will be depending on unemployment if things don't get better in the near future.

Maybe the printer in Alabama will pickup the slack for FSU when I withdraw my support from the university. After all, in order to have money to support our community we have to make a profit first.

It is my hope that this message can reach as far as the unemployed workers in our state so that they have a better grasp on how the people running our state government choose to spend the revenues that we all provide for them.

It is my hope that those of you with the power to change these policies that are harming the residents, workers, business owners, and taxpayers of our state will do something about this inequity.

Sincerely,

Good afternoon Governor:
 
Just wanted to say that I enjoyed your press conference on Jose's appointment as FDOT Secretary. We are proud to have him and know he will do a great job. 
 
I was working with Phil Nixon at the Sons of the American Revolution putting together my patriot family history on the Marsh and Van Westervelt lines of my family. He wanted me to pass on his hello to you. He told me that he sponsored you in your quest to join the SAR. He was very complementary of you, and I promised I would pass on the well wishes.
 
Although I have always been a student of history, I have just in the last few years started doing family research. If you ever have time, I would love to talk to you about some of our family stories and ancestral lines. While doing some research on my Dutch ancestors, I saw some Bush families (1700s) listed living in the same areas of New York (New Amsterdam) and New Jersey. If I am correct, I read that you ancesters were on the Mayflower. This stuff is really interesting!
 
Thanks for giving us the opportunity to hear Mrs. Cheney speak about history at your leadership forum. I was fascinated by her story about Gettysburg and Joshua Chamberlain.....I really wanted to make a comment about my cousin, General Stephen Dodson Ramseur, being wounded in that battle......but of course he was fighting with Lee on the other side.......decided not to in the forum.
 
Thanks for all you do!

I also just got finished reviewing the bid submitted by WRE, Inc. and think it is very good.  It appears to be professionally done.  I was advised to the contrary.  I was advised that this would have been an Invitation to Negotiate, which would have avoided this advice to me, and I could have submitted the information as I would have liked to.  
 
I still think this was politically motivated.  There are too many 30 year veteran Park employees involved for things to keep changing at apparent wims.  Things just don't work this way with Parks.  Mike Bullock is well aware of the politics between Parks and my business, which has gone on for years. I am suspicious.
 
I encourage the Secretary of the DEP to turn the whole matter over to the Inspector General's Office and get the politics out of it.  I don't think it is fair to keep the DEP bogged down with this issue or my own business bogged down.  My business has suffered financially over the years, because of actions by Park staff, especially at Suwannee River State Park, so it is time to get somebody not connected with old issues to resolve the matter.  This has gone on for too long and cost too much time and money for everybody.  
 
If I can't get a timely response to this issue, I would like to take it to the Governor and ask for his help.  He is aware of the history and problems of this thing.  I will notify you, before I take this action on Monday.
 
Thanks

Subject: Fw: Noah's Ark and


If you don't take the time to read Noah's Ark, at least scroll down and read my message about what is happening according to our Christian radio station here in Ocala, Fl  
Gov Bush, Maybe you can shed some light on what is really happening.  Either way. Thank You 

NOAH'S ARK....


It's the year 2003 and Noah lives in the United States. The Lord speaks to Noah and said, "In one year I'm going to make it rain and cover the whole earth with water until all is destroyed. But I want you to save the righteous people and two of every kind of living thing on the earth. Therefore, I am commanding you to build an Ark."

In a flash of lightning, God delivered the specifications for an Ark.

Fearful and trembling, Noah took the plans and agreed to build the Ark.

"Remember," said the Lord, "You must complete the Ark and bring everything aboard in one year."

Exactly one year later, a fierce storm cloud covered the earth and all the seas of the earth went into a tumult. The Lord saw Noah sitting in his front yard weeping. 

"Noah." He shouted, "Where is the Ark?" 

"Lord please forgive me!" cried Noah. "I did my best but there were big problems. First, I had to get a permit for construction and your plans did not comply with the codes. I had to hire an engineering firm and redraw the plans. 

Then I got into a fight with OSHA over whether or not the Ark needed a fire sprinkler system and floatation devices. 

Then my neighbor objected, claiming I was violating zoning ordinances by building the Ark in my front yard, so I had to get a variance from the city planning commission. 

I had problems getting enough wood for the Ark, because there was a ban on cutting trees to protect the Spotted Owl. I finally convinced the U.S. Forest Service that I needed the wood to save the owls. 

However, the Fish and Wildlife Service won't let me catch any owls. So, no owls. 

The carpenters formed a union and went out on strike. I had to negotiate a settlement with the National Labor Union. Now I have 16 carpenters on the Ark, but still no owls. 

When I started rounding up the other animals, I got sued by an animal rights group. They objected to me only taking two of each kind aboard. Just when I got the suit dismissed, the EPA notified me that I could not complete the Ark without filing an environmental impact statement on your proposed flood. They didn't take very kindly to the idea that they had no jurisdiction over the conduct of the Creator of the universe. 

Then the Army Corps of Engineer demanded a map of the proposed new flood plain. I sent them a globe. 

Right now, I am trying to resolve a complaint filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that I am practicing discrimination by not taking godless, unbelieving people aboard! 

The IRS has seized all my assets, claiming that I'm building the Ark in preparation to flee the country to avoid paying taxes. I just got a notice from the State that I owe some kind of user tax and failed to register the Ark as a recreational water craft." 

Finally the ACLU got the courts to issue an injunction against further construction of the Ark, saying that since God is flooding the earth, it is a religious event and therefore unconstitutional. 

I really don't think I can finish the Ark for another 5 or 6 years!" Noah wailed. 

The sky began to clear, the sun began to shine and the seas began to calm. A rainbow arched across the sky. Noah looked up hopefully. "You mean you are not going to destroy the earth, Lord?" 

"No," said the Lord sadly. "The government already has".

A message from me.....
  Do you know what they said on one of the Christian radio stations?  Someone said their child goes to a public school and they said, "there isn't any "Public Schools"  they are "Government Schools" and you know, They have been run by the government for several years, but once they put that name on the out side of our school buildings, it will make "Now" look like playtime.  (Playing with the minds)that is. We need more home schoolers or at least Christian Non Government Schools) Not at our cost but at the Childrens cost.  They are the ones who will have to pay.  Not in Dollars tho. Want to forward this message to anyone?  It is something to definitely think about and be concerned about.  Public schools never were Perfect but at least the Gov't didn't run them to "beyond Your control"

I'm no great strategist, but just an idea that I read that makes sense on 
class size.  What about supporting an initiative that goes on the ballot to 
mandate class size in grades K-3 only.  It would have the effect of you 
supporting a popular initiative, but limiting the scope of the cost and the 
focus on the early grades, just as the reading iniative.  It also allows you 
to proactively support the passage of an initiative that people like, without 
the incredible cost of a K-12 mandate that clearly is unreasonable.  It sure 
beats just simply opposing any and all class size measures.

would be wise to make a date of say 5-10 yrs later to accommodate the

Thanks so much for being a friend of those needing the services of the Transportation Disadvantaged program.  Especially in our rural areas this is the most cost effective and humane response.  There are those who may be short-sighted in looking to eliminate this program; it would just create more costly alternatives and put our most frail and fragile further at risk.
Thank you for all you do....and we are praying for you in these tough times.

Dear Gov.:

Jill and I were at the swearing in ceremony of Toni Jennings yesterday. The Jennings Family is all about servant leadership. John, her brother, and I met over twenty-five years ago when John and I served in the position as Key Club Presidents in our high schools, John in Orlando and me at Tampa's Jesuit.  

We loved hearing your passion for new ideas.  We provided three ideas to Alan of your travel leadership team. (Surprise, surprise! I love thinking out off the box.)  All three ideas tie into your passion to strengthen families.  The Kimball's have locked into your vision and want to help you grow it in the most creative ways.  The "Gateway to..." has a lot of promise to connect with our newest quarter design selection. Please let us know your thoughts!

On another note, I am very excited to help you and Toni Jennings with your reading initiative. This Thursday, W. Berry Fowler the Founder of Sylvan Learning, and I are meeting with Jim Horne and members of his reading team to explain his Knowledge Points program. (This program brings the proven "Sylvan-like" tutoring program to the children, either through a non-for profit organization or through the school systems at a much lower cost!) I think this is a big part of the answers you are looking for!

I am very excited to help you and Toni Jennings with your family strengthening and reading initiative here in Florida.

The acquisition of Martin's Island, in Nassau County, was approved by the Governor and the Cabinet, a move that will put the 105-acre island into public ownership. The Trust for Public Land (TPL) has been working to protect Martin's Island, a pristine barrier island off the coast of northeast Florida just south of the Georgia border, for two years.

BILLBOARDS AND SIGN CONTROL 

Weston seeking billboard rules

WESTON, FL Sex, booze and flashing lights on billboards at the city's main entrance? Not if Weston officials can prevent it. They want the two billboards on the west side of Interstate 75, which were built and owned by Weston developer Arvida-JMB Partners, to continue carrying conservative, hometown messages, as they always have. But the U.S. Constitution's free-speech provisions may take the matter out of city officials' hands when Arvida sells the 672-square-foot billboards -the company's last unsold asset in the city it began creating more than 30 years ago.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWERS 

Environmental groups sue to stop Gulf Coast cell towers

PENSACOLA, FL - Three environmental groups are suing the Federal Communications Commission to halt the placement of cellular telephone towers along the Gulf Coast in five states, claiming towers have been responsible for killing thousands of birds. The suit, filed Thursday in Washington, D.C., asks for a court order to stop the FCC from issuing licenses to build more towers within 100 miles of the Gulf of Mexico from Tampa to the southern tip of Texas at Port Isabel until their effect on birds can be assessed and mitigated. The Forest Conservation Council of Santa Fe, N.M., and the American Bird Conservancy and Friends of the Earth, both based in Washington, say migratory birds collide with the towers and their support wires, particularly at night and other times when visibility is poor. "The unregulated jumble of communications towers littering the coastal forests, wetlands, farmlands and barrier islands of the Gulf Coast region are  killing tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of migratory birds each year, John Talberth, conservation director for the Forest Conservation Council, said in a news release.

Road planners to revamp public input process 

LEE COUNTY, FL -- Those planning Lee County's long-range transportation future are trying to come up with ways to let local residents know about major road projects that might affect them before a road shows up in their backyard. The Metropolitan Planning Organization is the multi-jurisdictional agency that prioritizes the spending of federal and state transportation money. It has 15 voting members, all of them elected officials from the County Commission and city governments in Lee County. They act to establish priorities for road projects that have no longer made their way into the five-year building plans of the county or the state. The long-range nature of the work makes it hard to get people interested - at least until nebulous discussions about potential roadway corridors become public workshops on routing roads through neighborhoods. "Unfortunately, most of the public doesn't get involved until the last minute," said Al Roseman, a 
Bonita Springs engineer and a longtime member of the MPO's Citizens Advisory Committee. That committee is responsible for bringing public opinion to the MPO along with the Technical Advisory Committee, a more nuts and bolts group dealing with engineering facts and traffic tendencies.  <http://www.naplesnews.com/03/02/bonita/d901345a.htm> http://www.naplesnews.com/03/02/bonita/d901345a.htm 

 

Venice, FL: US 41 may get scenic status 

Some motorists may see U.S. 41 as a congested route of strip malls, automobile dealerships and restaurants. But representatives of seven local governments believe the stretch of the Tamiami Trail from the Manatee/Hillsborough County line through North Port is worthy of formal recognition from the state. Working with the Sarasota/Manatee Metropolitan Planning Organization, a Corridor Advocacy Group is now applying to get the roadway recognized under the Florida Department of Transportation's Scenic Highway program. "This corridor is about 70 miles long, so it has a lot of the different elements required for scenic highway designation," Susan King, scenic highway coordinator with the District 1 FDOT office, said.

Tallahassee, FL: Kate Ireland Parkway Dressing Up 

In the spring, it will be a bouquet of snowy dogwood blossoms. In the summer, it will be a sea of wildflowers. In the fall, it will be a canvas of colored leaves. In the winter, it will be a tunnel through towering pines. Whatever the season, the Kate Ireland Parkway is going to be a gorgeous stretch of highway. "I see no reason for roads to be ugly, straight ribbons," said plantation owner and conservationist Kate Ireland. "I think we have a unique piece of Florida. I think we should do everything we can to preserve what's here. "Thanks in part to the largesse of Ireland, for whom the parkway is named, a portion of Thomasville Road is being saved from ugly-dom - the natural way. The state Department of Transportation is planting a cornucopia of native trees, shrubs and grasses on the median and shoulders of 8½ miles of U.S. Highway 319 (Thomasville Road) from the Georgia line to Bradfordville.

Orange Lake Overlook: Open or Developed? 

Rally planned to show support for protecting OLO. We have all seen the beautiful vista that overlooks Orange Lake on US Hwy 441 just south of the town of McIntosh. The sweeping landscape captures the imagination and provides a reminder of "Old Florida," as well as an incredible panoramic view of Orange Lake. It is the stomping ground of artists, astronomy and space shuttle enthusiasts, and anyone else who appreciates open, rural lands. It is some of the best of what remains in this part of the state -- and it is in imminent danger of development. The southern 100 or so acres of the Orange Lake Overlook -the "OLO" -- have been rezoned by Marion County for 5-acre home sites. Development could begin as early as this summer. However, the owner is willing to sell the land to conservation interests and would like to seethe landscape preserved. Since last year, CTF has been working toward protecting the property by pursuing state and local funds. We are attempting to forge a coalition between the state and Marion County to purchase the southernmost property as well as conservation easements on two other parcels that complete the OLO. We have a good chance at funding from the state through their Florida Communities Trust (FCT) program, but approximately $800,000 in matching funds from the county is needed. In January, CTF presented a formal proposal to the Marion County Parks and Environmental Lands Acquisition Advisory Committee (PELAAC) for such funding. Unfortunately, a majority of PELAAC did not support PELAAC member Shirley Little's motion to consider the OLO project for possible funding from the existing $20million Pennies for Parks fund. We are convinced that a strong citizen support base --especially from Marion County citizens -- will bolster this project. It would show that citizens want to protect this treasured landscape from sprawled development.

 

Toward that end, CTF -- in conjunction with several Marion County citizen organizations -- is organizing an OLO Rally to gather support and educate the public about the threats and opportunities for this glorious site. The OLO Rally will occur at the Orange Lake Overlook on a yet-to-be-determined date in April and will include refreshments, information items, and more. Please come and support our efforts to save this gem, and bring a friend or neighbor! With widespread support, we will help the Commission understand the importance of protecting its rural landscapes and heritage.

Dear Governor

The second paragraph of my previous message said we shouldn't be seeking
more new residents of any age.  Florida is a unique state with extremely
limited egress in case of hurricanes or nuke power failures besides having
all the shortages already caused by too many people moving in too fast.
What other state has so much of its mass in wetlands where only stilt
houses with self-contained toilets should be allowed?

       It's time for a statewide look at which local governments have too
much planned growth in their future land use plans (probably all of them)
and work out which ones need to cut their density or otherwise cut back on
allowable new housing.  Then let DCA require that this be done--soon!  We
certainly should not wait until water shortages or overly expensive
solutions, such as desalinization, kick in and force emergency ill=planned
solutions and moratoria and force native born residents to leave the state
because they can't afford  the higher taxes and fees.  Jim and Joan
Hutchinson, Seminole Indian artists, and in-laws of Beanie Backus have
re-located from their beloved home in Stuart  to Hawaii for that reason.

believe that if I do not get this straightened out soon, he will divorce me 
and I will loose my family. My florida license number is M320-559-52-504-0. 
My texas license was TDL 02971914. I am disabled, as I have bi-polar

	Jim 

	In addition to the strategies we discussed two weeks ago concerning the connections in Florida with those who may be actively supporting terrorist action from groups like Islamic Jihad, Hamas, and Hezbollah, I recommend we look into the various Kurdish support groups (including at least one Kurdish terrorist group).  In 1943, President Roosevelt offered the Kurds their own homeland (presumably out of parts of Iran, Iraq, and Turkey) in exchange for their support of the allies against Germany.  He died before bringing that promise to conclusion, if it ever could have been brought to a successful conclusion.  One of the likely outcomes of the war in Iraq is the declaration of a Kurdish state in Northern Iraq.  We have declared in advance that we (the US) will not accept the partition of Iraq.  We will likely have to move to suppress this nascent state and may face terror reprisal from Kurdish groups disappointed in our actions.  Knowing what connections of this type exist in Florida will be important in terms of prevention and fore warning.

Dear Frank Brogan,
Cc: Gov Bush and Staff

Although I am a little slow in getting a chance to write (due to the limited internet access the library provides for poor people like myself), I nonetheless wish to take the time to write to thank you for your service as Lieutenant Governor for one and one half (1 1/2) terms under Florida Governor Jab Bush.

Before I forget, I want to acknowledge and thank you for an incredible favor you performed for me personally while in office. When I was driving my bicycle from my FSU college dorms to do some work and stopped at a local Publix shopping center to rest for a moment, I ran into you, and after I introduced myself and shook your hand, you immediately recalled that I had sent your office some email. While you eventually never did follow-up on my request to ensure "voter education," - neither did I - as I guess we were all busy with other things. (Actually, California has mandatory publishing of Candidates and Issues, and I should probably seek a similar measure before the State Legislature - if I ever get a chance.)

Though Gov Bush is known to personally known to read his own mail and respond to Florida constituents (he was familiar with a problem I had - and mentioned my concerns without any prompting in the recent "office hours" visit your two paid to Lakeland last March 2002 or so), your efforts to keep up with constituent concerns and not brag about it are very admirable. I am sure it will be hard for former Senate President, Toni Jennings to duplicate your efforts, but I am sure she will do fine.

I also appreciate the fact that you have done a good job at using the "bully pulpit" to help keep the public informed (read: educated) on issues. (For example: While former Lt Governor, Buddy McKay, was very intelligent and hardworking, he was not "visible" in the public eye like he could have been, so your efforts did some good here.)

I am sure you have heard of all the "noise" I am creating regarding my election lawsuit, alleging that Janet Reno's votes were not given the mandatory recount allowed by law.

To you and Gov Bush, and the others in authority, I must say that I hope you understand that I am not acting out of ill will in this matter (which, by the way, is currently before the FLORIDA STATE SUPREME COURT in case no: SC03-385, Lower Trib: 1D02-4272, and another pending appeal in case number 1D02-5120).  Rather, instead, I believe that a lot of people were unintentionally offended by the State's refusal to give this race the mandatory recount. This lawsuit is a bit complicated, in that, the current laws allow me to proceed in this suit even against Reno's wishes. However, don't burden yourself or worry about this matter: you probably have enough to keep you busy in your new job as a President of a major university.

I am glad to hear you were able to find a job that you enjoy. Although I am sure you will face many challenges and difficult issues, I am sure you will do well, if this is what you enjoy. After all, if God could make the Worlds, then repair and adjustments are easier - and we are told that his Son personally tested out a human body - so we could be assured that the human body's DNA works - and works well.

Thank you for all your service, and good luck on your new job.

Dear Governor Bush;
 
I appreciate your response.  This information that I sent to you is very important.  In a recent article written by FSEC, they emphasized the role energy conservation will play in home land security by lessening our need for Middle Eastern oil.  It seem audacious of me to claim a remedy for such a huge issue as our energy problems and even go so far as to link to homeland security, but this is a reality.  I have been so perplexed, because we ran into such a nonchalant attitude (actually bizarre) from one member of the DOE.  The President's chief advisor, Carl Rove had taken an interest in this project, but was unable to evoke a response from this individual after we had conducted test ( i.e. Florida Tech's) at the DOE'S request.  We felt that we had been road blocked for no explainable reason.  This technology is a real breakthrough for energy conservation and efficiency.  We keep talking about renewable energy, specifically photovoltaic, fuel cells and wind, but they are limited, because they will not generate enough "startup" amperage to start multiple appliances.......  We have tested with a Florida base company that specializes in fuel cell technology.......  They were unable to start more than one appliance at a time, but with our SAMM device they could start all of the appliances at once.  Two years ago, Detroit Edison was focusing a great deal of attention on fuel cells, we learned then that the project was losing ground because of this very issue.  We can solve this problem, but we need some help.  I was hoping that you could help us with this.

Nate Cummins

Dear Governor Bush;                                                   please see: accompanying doc. (attached)

 A number of months ago I sent you an email regarding the energy saving technology we have. If you recall, you sent the information to Pam Dana who contacted me for a telephone discussion. She assigned this issue to Brett Doster, who in turn contacted me to obtain additional information. This was at a particularly crucial time in your last campaign and realistically, Brett was so busy that it probably slipped his mind. Now that the campaign is successfully resolved I am in hopes that we can resume.

 With respect to your time, I will be brief. The technology I first described to you has been applied and tested with results that I think you need to be aware of. The first of these, is the evaluation conducted at the Florida Institute of Technology under order of the United States Department of Energy and conducted by Dr. Pierre Larochelle. 

 The second is a recent study conducted at COSO Operating Company, LLC. COSO is a power generation plant in the Mojave Desert and supplies electricity to Southern California and surrounding areas. I have attached the actual summary sheet pertaining to this study. If you will notice, our system was able to save about 4,000,000 kWh, or two hundred and thirty five dollars ($235,000) (cost  to COSO) of power per year. This power was simply lost in the power generation process, but is now able to be recovered. COSO engineers have informed us that virtually all of the thousands of power plants in the U.S. could benefit in the same manner from adaptation of our technology.

The final study was performed for Hilton Property Resorts and was conducted on a residential air conditioning system. Please note that the cost savings projected for one year was over three hundred dollars ($300). Imagine if only a fraction of the potential homeowners installed this devise, the overall cost savings is mind-bending. The cost for this particular unit is less than two hundred dollars ($200) so it easily pays for itself in the first year, but as importantly, less power is used to perform the same job. Actually, there are more benefits, but we can discuss them at another time.

 Governor Bush, I have been very frustrated concerning this whole issue. We have one of the most outstanding technologies available today, but are experiencing great difficulty in obtaining financial help. Funds we obtain will bring the product to a new level of importance by adding wireless/satellite communications for downtime cost control management for property and equipment.

 Governor Bush, we need your help! The summer months and the subsequent power outages are going to, again, be upon us. WE CAN SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.

We would ask for thirty minutes of time from you and your staff (and any engineers you may wish to attend) to demonstrate what this technology can do. We will assure you that they will all be amazed by what they see. The start up money we seek is five million dollars but the value to the State and Federal government is immeasurable. Application in mass quantity by Florida and other states would have a profound cost reduction effect on the utility costs you are now paying. We will of course, have testimonials available. We of course, will be available at your choice of time and location.

 There is an existing urgency to getting this wonderful technological breakthrough in use. I am certain that you would find this to be among the most productive half hours you could have.   I know that it may not be your policy to open and read attached docs.( I have experience this with Gov. Davis -CA) , but I urge you to read these.

 Warmest regards,

Nathan Cummins

President – Controlled Energy Technologies, Inc.

Dear Jeb,

Thank you very much for your reply. We appreciate it. Lex Frieden, NCD Chairman, was informed about it. We look forward to hear from your schedulers.

By the way, last Thursday afternoon, the NCD had a working meeting at the Indian Treaty Room of the White House (Old Executive Building). During a very short recess, while two NCD members, Berthy and I were in the hall talking about the business of the day, your brother, President Bush, came out of a nearby office with Tom Ridge and others and we were able to say hello to and shake hands with him. I believe that he recognized our group because we were with Lex Frieden, the NCD Chairman. We reminded him that we have met him during your first inauguration. He remembered the event by saying that it was very chilly. It was good to meet him. Berthy used the occasion to remind him that we were Lucy's parents. He repeated the name "Lucy..." trying to remember who was Lucy. I am not quite sure that he knew what person we were referring to. Berthy reminded him that you had a picture of Lucy in your office.  Three or four pictures were taken of him with the four of us by his official photographer and then he continue talking down the hall with the 4-5 men that were with him at that moment. I asked the public relations officer of the NCD to get me a copy of those pictures but he was not confident that he could achieve that.

At our referenced NCD meeting in the Indian Treaty Room we heard from about 13 high government officials of the federal government. Terri Dominguez (Director EEOC) and Dr. Robert Pasternack (Assistant Secretary, US  Dept. of Education) were two of them. It was very interesting. Later on, on Saturday we had a long range planning session. We all agreed that the most significant area of interest for persons with disabilities is the area of employment. We will be focusing on that. I will keep you posted.

Thanks Jeb. Have a good day. May God bless you and your family.

Con mucho afecto y carino, quedo, como siempre,

Lauderdale or Miami, Florida. I have promoted this event and the NCD is excited about the idea of having this great opportunity to have you address the group. The date is open. We usually meet for 2-3 days within the week days of the week (no weekends).  Please suggest what day you are available by end of January or beginning of February of next year and we will arrange our meeting around the day that you are available. We only need a couple of hours from your time. Please let us know as soon as you can so we can do the necessary planning.

Thanks. Con afecto y carino, como siempre,

Milton Aponte

thank you for writing. George was a great public servant. I admired him greatly. As it relates to your idea regarding Fishing for Success, this is a tough year to do much from the state government perspective. Have you discussed your thoughts with the FFWCC? The board could have some suggestions regarding funding.

Subject: Fishing, education, and families


Dear Governor Bush:

On February 5th, we lost a truly great Floridian, former state-senator
George G. Kirkpatrick Jr. George was my best friend and we often met
over the last 20 years to discuss initiatives that could better the
lives of all Floridians. He convinced me to start Florida LAKEWATCH, a
citizen’s volunteer water quality monitoring program
(http://lakewatch.ifas.ufl.edu/) and Fishing for Success, a youth
education program that uses fishing as a hook to excite our youth
(http://fishweb.ifas.ufl.edu/FishSUCCESS/FishSuccess.htm). On the Friday
prior to his death, we discussed for four hours three of his loves
(outside of his family) ? fishing, education, and business. He was
urging me to modify the Fishing for Success program to create a
Community Learning Center where all parts of government, faith-based
organizations, and businesses could help not only the youth, but also
their parents or other significant adults to learn and strengthen family
bonds!

I explained to George that last year Fishing for Success hosted over
13,000 youth in the Gainesville area. After giving me his well-known
steely-eyed glare, his words were "Not Enough!" George envisioned using
our youth education program Fishing for Success as a foundation for
empowering teachers and parents. He was also convinced that a program
developed by a private company, Learn to Learn Inc., out of Orlando had
great merit. George also commented that working with Fish & Game’s youth
programs and those of UF’s 4H programs could bring the great benefits of
Fishing for Success to communities all across Florida.

I write to you because I believe that many of George’s core beliefs in
fishing, education and business are nearly identical to yours. You are
also probably one of the few individuals in Florida that could help make
George’s dream of establishing a Community Learning Center become
reality. So what can you do?

Creative Ideas, Contacts, and Resources!!!!!!!

I know you must have been thinking about the problems encountered by our
Florida families for a long time and I would love to receive any
guidance you can offer now that I no longer have George to keep my ivory
tower head screwed on straight. However, I have some ideas that I throw
forth for your consideration.

First, your proposed budget calls for cutting the Florida Fish and
Wildlife Conservation Commission’s youth fishing program. If part of the
cut money ($250,000) could be placed in the University of Florida’s IFAS
budget for Fishing for Success, the program could be rapidly expanded to
serve over 20,000 youth in the Gainesville area. This would permit more
field trips from the schools, outings from faith-based organizations,
and more family reunification nights by different groups associated with
the Department of Juvenile Justice. The new money would also permit the
capture of the vast resources of the statewide 4H network. This would
have a multiplying effect, which would ultimately permit the reaching of
100,000s of youth. Finally, with the 4H network and the Fishing for
Success program bonded together, we would be able to directly partner
with AG in the Classroom, which would assist the delivery of needed
educational material to our schools. Ag in the Classroom is funded by
specialty license plates (a benefit) and their involvement would help
bind the rural and urban communities.

Second, your proposed budget cuts many of the juvenile prevention
programs (Congratulations you finally got their attention and they now
seem willing to discuss what works and what does not work). Fishing for
Success directly works with the Gainesville Wilderness Institute and
Learn to Learn Inc. to help youth that had just been released from
Juvenile Justice transition back into the community. One of the major
components of our partnerships is the family reunification nights where
we use fishing and food to help bring the youth and their parents back
together. We have found this approach to strengthening family bonds to
work extremely well. We have also found that part of the youths’ dislike
for education is directly related to their parents’ disillusionment with
education. Here the Learn to Learn program is directly helping both the
youth and their parents and we are seeing many positive signs of
improvement. My thoughts (assuming that Fishing for Success has base
funding) are that these two programs should receive about $500,000
annually. With that level of funding, the programs could better
integrate with the Alachua County Public Schools and the youth from GWI
could help prevent younger kids from falling out of grace. The Learn to
Learn program would empower teachers and help them focus on the needs of
the individual student. Also, the Learn to Learn program could help
raise the FCAT scores of our poorer performing schools.

Perhaps more importantly, there is local community support for the
approach. This would allow the leveraging of the $500,000 seed money
with local money and we could then establish a major training center
that could help other communities throughout Florida. The goal would
always be to insure that "No Child is left behind!"

Third, I believe that with your many contacts we could raise private
funding for Fishing for Success. When you look at our website, you will
see a section called "Friends of Fishing for Success." This group was
founded so that the individual or a business could donate funds for the
program. As you can see from our 2003 contributors, we have a diverse
group, but I am sure your contacts could ultimately raise sufficient
funds that tax dollars would not be needed for Fishing for Success or
the Community Learning Center.

I know that I have taken the liberty to throw many ideas on the table,
but I truly believe fishing can help us in our urbanizing world. I
invite you to come to one of our family fishing days. In fact, we have
one of our biggest events on May 31st. At that event you will see the
community partnership in action and you will see many smiles on the
faces of our kids and parents. I hope you busy schedule will allow you
to come to Gainesville that morning and not only fish with the kids, but
have a wonderful hotdog dinner.

Best Regards,

Dan

Director of Florida LAKEWATCH

Re:  Tragedy of a life sentence for a 12 year old Florida boy

 

Dear Governor Bush,

 

          You probably know all about the tragedy of Lionel Tate (the 12 year old boy sentenced to life in prison for the 1999 "murder" of a six year old girl) but, my wife and I felt compelled to share our hearts with you regarding his life in prison.  

 

When we saw the heart-breaking story on 20/20 last Thursday night about Lionel, we were shocked to learn of the severity of his life in prison sentence.  Even the mother of the deceased girl (Deweese Eunick-Paul) cannot believe the life sentence received by Lionel and wants him freed from incarceration.

 

          A you likely know, the details of the little girl's death are, of course, controversial, but it appears to many to have been more of an accident than the vicious, deliberate beating for which Lionel was convicted.

 

          Since last Thursday, the fate of Lionel, who is now 16 and a year away from transfer to an adult penitentiary, has really been on our hearts.   As a man of faith, my wife and I are asking you to consider whether you should immediately pardon this boy, showing him the mercy and forgiveness that we have all experienced through a merciful and unconditionally loving God.   

 

Thank you for your time and heart,

Dear Jeb,
 
There really is a lot of work to be done at the DOE, but the ground is finally fertile and well tilled. I am very optimistic that we can make a difference NOW.
 
Dennis is beginning to think about changing jobs so that the family can all be together in Tallahassee.  He is the Director of Information Services for a large architectural and engineering firm (BRPH) - they build schools.  He loves his job - but he loves his family more.  Larry Wood thought there might be some opportunities for him at the Capitol. What do you think?
 
See you on Wednesday - I will be at the ICUF lunch award ceremony for you, and then I will be addressing the group at their meeting later that afternoon.

Also, re construction. I keep hearing on 610 AM radio an ad for General Steel for building constructions at 1/2 the cost of conventional ones.  1-888-98-Steel

Governor Bush,    
 
    My name is Timothy Bidwell and I live in District 4  Mason City in Columbia County.  I attend the County Commission meetings held Lake City. At the most recent meeting on March 6, 2003 I found it to be absolutely appalling the way Chairman Ron Williams spoke to County Commissioner Jennifer Flynn Rep.. She is the only female and the only Republican in the County Commission and in Columbia County.  When he would address her he never addressed her by her proper title.  He addressed every other Board Member by their proper titles and always referred to her as "woman".  He even at one point in the meeting said " have it you're own way woman you're crazy". 
    Chairman Williams is slandering her in this manor because Commissioner Flynn is defending the District 4 Gas Tax money from Political Nepotism.
Chairman Williams has turned our Commission meetings into a 3 ring circus.  I am requesting that you investigate Chairman Williams and bring him up on charges of ethics violation for his horrible behavior and treatment of Commissioner Flynn.
 
                                                            Thank You

Dear Governor Jeb, Sir,
 
     1.  THANK YOU again for calling my student, Melody Heflin, who had a difficult time with her older brother being shipped over seas.  Your very caring gesture really helped Melody AND her family!  Your call helped young, shy Melody gain a sense of importance in the view of her peers.  I took pictures of her as she listened to your encouragements and presented them to her with her parents present in our classroom this past Friday afternoon.  All my students were then writing cards and drawing "cartoons" to send to Pvt. Jeric Heflin now that he's over in Jordan with his unit.
 
     2.  We've just about made it through another FCAT, as we'll be completed Wednesday.  I took a 70 pound plus rock into my classroom the day after Super Bowl and set it up on a table and the kids have "pounded the FCAT ROCK" as they come into class everyday.  The idea came to me as I heard the strategies described that Coach Jon Gruden utilized to get the Bucks in shape to win the Super Bowl.  As we "pounded the FCAT ROCK" daily,  the kids chanted test taking strategies aloud.  It seemed to have help...but time will tell the tale.
 
      3.  There have been many problems in my life since I last saw you at the Kissimmee Rodeo Arena during your campaign last summer.   That's why you haven't been hearing from me. The situation has been working its way through the court system since October.  
 
     My 43-year old son is deeply  drug and alcohol dependent and has been incarcerated for the past six months after a horrible incident with me while he was high!  He took the plea that I begged our State's Attorney's Dept. in Bartow to offer him on February 24 and will, I think, be returning to his "home" in Tennessee when he is released on March 13.   
 
     Now that these horrendous experiences are behind me, I just want to ENCOURAGE YOU!  I want to share with you that even though your dear daughter's problem has been used by the Devil against you repeatedly in the media to negate the positive things that you are doing for our state, I want to ENCOURAGE YOU that at least (from what I read) she has not REASSIGNED her guilt to you and your other family members as my son has done so many times against me.  When sin "rises its ugly head" and a child turns on their parent, there is NO GREATER HURT that exists after we have nurtured, loved and sacrificed for them their whole lives!!
 
    There is no need for you to respond about your views on this tender topic to me...I just wanted you to know that no matter how bad and tough things become because of your daughter's problems, just please continually praise God that she still has a relationship with you and your wife and that you all are not under an injunction for protection situation with your own child as I am.
 
    4.  I also want to share with you how much I KNOW we are SO BLESSED, INDIVIDUALLY--and as a NATION, to have such honorable men as you and your brother in leadership positions in our trouble-filled world of today!  
 
THANK YOU Sir, for the sacrifices YOU MAKE to provide a "better Florida" for us!
 
With deepest RESPECT and many  regards,
 
Ellen, a/k/a Your "Florida Sunshine 'GIRL' "

Subject: AMEN

   This speaks for itself!

I don't believe in Santa Claus, but I'm not 
going to sue somebody for singing a Ho-Ho-
Ho song in December!

I don't agree with Darwin, but I didn't go out and 
hire a lawyer when my high school teacher taught 
his theory of evolution!

Life, liberty or your pursuit of happiness will not be 
endangered because someone says a 30-second 
prayer before a football game.  So what's the big 
deal? It's not like somebody is up there reading the 
entire book of Acts. They're just talking to a God 
they believe in and asking him to grant safety to the 
players on the field and the fans going home from 
the game.

"But it's a Christian prayer," some will argue.  Yes, and 
this is the United States of America, a country founded 
on Christian principles.

And we are in the Bible Belt.  According to our very 
own phone book, Christian churches outnumber all 
others better than 200-to-1.  So what would you 
expect-somebody chanting Hare Krishna? If I went 
to a football game in Jerusalem, I would expect to 
hear a Jewish prayer.  If I went to a soccer game in 
Baghdad, I would expect to hear a Muslim prayer.  
If I went to a ping pong match in China, I would  
expect to hear someone pray to Buddha.  And I 
wouldn't be offended. It wouldn't bother me one bit.  
When in Rome...

"But what about the atheists?" is another argument.  
What about them? Nobody is asking them to be 
baptized.  We're not going to pass the collection plate.  
Just humor us for 30 seconds.  If that's asking too 
much, bring a Walkman or a pair of ear plugs. Go to 
the bathroom.  Visit the concession stand.  Call your 
lawyer.  Unfortunately, one or two will make that call.  
One or two will tell thousands what they can and 
cannot do.

I don't think a short prayer at a football game is going  
to shake the world's foundations.

Christians are just sick and tired of turning the other 
cheek while our courts strip us of all our rights.  Our 
parents and grandparents taught us to pray before 
eating, to pray before we go to sleep.  Our Bible tells 
us just to pray without ceasing.  Now a handful of 
people and their lawyers are telling us to cease praying.  
God, help us.  And if that last sentence offends you, 
well..........just sue me.  The silent majority has been 
silent too long.. it's time we let that one or two who 
scream loud enough to be heard, that the vast majority 
don't care what they want.. it is time the majority rules!
It's time we tell them, you don't have to pray.. you don't 
have to say the pledge of allegiance, you don't have to 
believe in God or attend services that honor Him.  That 
is your right, and we will honor your right.. but by 
golly you are no longer going to take our rights away ... 
we are fighting back... and we WILL WIN!  After all 
the God you have the right to denounce is on our side!

God bless us one and all, especially those who denounce 
Him...God bless America, despite all her faults.. still the 
greatest nation of all...God bless our service men who 
are fighting to protect our right to pray and worship God...

May 2003 be the year the silent majority is heard and we 
put God back as the foundation of our families and institutions.

Keep looking up...
In God WE Trust!

Jeb, I appreciated your straight and frank words in your State of the State Address.  I have several bills filed to help carry out some of the very same ideas.

Workers Comp: I am sponsoring bill in Senate that will mirror Dennis Ross in the House.  We have been working with some of the folks from your office.  We must reduce the depth to which our system is manipulated by the lawyers.

Consitutional Reform: My bill reduces the time permitted to gather petitions, increases the required vote to 2/3's but would allow for petitions to create statute at a 55% vote.  But any citizen initiative to create statute would be subject to a veto and a sunset with 24 months unless affirmed by the legislature.  Frankly, I don't want to offer up voting on statute but to put the Consitution out of reach we need to offer something and this is a pretty safe design.

Hope we can visit one of these days soon.

In challenging times every family makes some hard choices.  Florida's families appreciate the straight talk.  They will appreciate the fact that we are not going to burden them with additional expenses at a time when they are addressing their personal challenges.

As a family we continue of offer you our prayers and we remain grateful for your leadership and for the ever vibrant Spirit of Florida!

Subject:	SWFWMD  Exec. Director Search



Governor:

As you know, the Governing Board for the Southwest Florida Water 
Management District is searching for a new Executive Director to replace Sonny 
Vergara.  I have been keeping close track of this and have already personally 
interviewed several of the candidates.  Unfortunately, the process took a 
surprising turn on Friday.

The Board had received applications from 10 qualified candidates.  The plan 
was to narrow that pool to four or five and then begin Board interviews.  I was 
led to believe that  two of this group would be internal candidates from the 
District staff, the others would be external candidates.  I was personally pleased 
with the individuals they intended to interview.

I received a call from Board Chair, Ronnie Duncan, on Saturday.  He informed 
me that that Board met on Friday and that they decided to only interview the two 
internal candidates.  I can share more of the details of how this happened later.

I will now be working to expand the interview process to meet its original 
objectives.  It makes no sense to have recruited 10 viable applicants and to then 
only interview the internal candidates.

I had made it clear to the Board Chair that after they had narrowed the selection 
down to 1 or 2 top candidates, we would schedule a short visit with you before 
the job was offered.  I will be making it clear that getting to that point first 
requires the Board avail itself of the opportunity to interview the external 
candidates they successfully attracted.  I will need your support on this.

David

PS -- Some good news from the districts....  I was reviewing numbers this 
weekend.  Their collective "One Florida" performance has increased by 160% 
since the beginning of that initiative.  South Florida leads the pack.

Hello Governor
 
I recently entered the "Land of Oz" when I had the opportunity to competively "bid" on a State Park facility as a concessionaire.  
 
I would like to say that the bidding process is not over, but I was notified that the only other bidding company got the bid.  
 
In the Land of Oz, aka State Parks, the bid was initially awarded by a committee of State Park employees to a company which there is no record of before January 22, 2003.  The company filed a bid which states that they were in business for the 2 previous years.  According to the Department of Revenue records this company did not do so well, since they didn't file sales and other taxes.  They weren't even listed with the DOR as a business.  Hmmmm?
 
This is interesting for several reasons.   The company, which submitted the "bid," also listed their address at a location adjacent to Suwannee River State Park.  The manager of Suwannee River State Park is on the committee that decides who gets the bid.  His name is Steve Yoczic, and he knew more than the Department of Revenue about this business, because he recommended giving the bid to this company.  Mr. Yoczic and his boss, Torrey Johnson, in the regional office in Gainesville (isn't it a surprise that things which happen 90 miles away are decided in Gainesville?  Keep the White Springs, Gainesville, Lake City agenda in mind) did visit my site on several occassions, but, according to Steve Yoczic, they never visited the other site.  However, the other  site is adjacent or nearly adjacent to Manager Steve Yoczic's State Park.  I could not find at this location when I tried to visit this business.  
 
Now, in the Land of Oz (aka State Parks), the bid was awarded on the businesses 6 point plan.  In other words, the State Park employee committee did not care whether they carried the proper insurance, paid sales and use taxes or were even a legitamite business.  They did make their decision on such facts that the submitted bid did mention that they would sell hot dogs, chips and soda for $3.50 and sausage, chips and soda for $4.50.  This bidder did not even discuss such important issues as insurance and whether they could provide it.
 
There are many more details to this story.  Thank God that David Struhs and Bob Ballard brought integrity to this bid and did not allow the Land of OZ (Florida State Parks) to rig the bid.  
 
Anyway, Governor, this is an informal update.  In the meantime, I hope a house doesn't land on Wendy Spencer (Head of State Parks).  This would leave her flying monkeys (park staff) on their own.  Then, where would small private businesses, such as mine, go for cooperation?  Ha! Ha! 
 
Please contact David Struhs for information as to who the Park's committee members are (hint: same bunch who opposed your 5 year plan at White Springs).
 
I'll keep you updated.  Here in Oz, life is a hoot!

TK,

Here is the press release received Wednesday from the Governor's office that I mentioned today at the University Center Club. I have highlighted in red the relevant reference to the strategic alliance between the Universidad PolitŽcnica de Valencia and the University of Miami. We already have an agreement with this University and  our Valencia Study Center is located on their campus and our students and faculty have access to their campus facilities. We also use some of their faculty as adjunct faculty and staff  in our center. Our Spain Study Center has been located on their campus for three years. I have discussed in the past with Dr. Ray Bye the possibility of joint research projects with our faculty and the faculty of Universidad PolitŽcnica de Valencia.

GOVERNOR BUSH MEETS WITH SPAIN'S PRESIDENT AND TOP BUSINESS EXECUTIVES ON DAY TWO OF TRADE MISSION


MADRID, SPAIN - On February 17th, Governor Jeb Bush met with Spain's President, Jose Maria Aznar, and top Spanish elected and business leaders from a variety of industries during day two of his mission to Florida's fastest growing European trade partner, Spain.


In a series of private meetings, the Governor also met with senior officials from Telefonica, Caja Madrid and Iberia Airlines to thank them for their corporate presence in Florida and encourage them to consider future expansion in the Sunshine State.


"These three companies alone have shown a true commitment to Florida and today was a chance to show my gratitude for their investment in our state," said Governor Bush. "I also encouraged them to consider Florida for their future expansion projects. Our status as the Gateway to the Americas is very appealing for Spanish companies looking to establish themselves in Latin America."


During the Governor's meeting with President Aznar, the two discussed the longstanding historic, cultural, and economic ties between Florida and Spain, specifically discussing Spain's establishment of the United States' oldest city - St. Augustine.


Also on Feb. 17th, the Governor joined Madrid Community President, Alberto Ruiz Gallardon, in signing a strategic agreement between Florida and Madrid to foster continued economic trade and investment cooperation between the two regions.


Governor Bush additionally witnessed the signing of strategic alliances involving two of Florida's universities. The University of Miami signed a strategic alliance with the Universidad PolitŽcnica de Valencia, one of Spain's leading research and teaching universities. This international collaboration aims to achieve world-class joint research in engineering and information technology, joint grants, research faculty exchanges and student exchanges. Florida International University also signed an alliance with the Fundaci—n Universitaria San Pablo-CEU. The two universities will exchange faculty and students for high-tech research at FIU's Madrid Center for Education, Research and Development.


Day two of the trade mission concluded with a reception hosted by the United States Ambassador to Spain, George L. Argyros.


Since taking office, Governor Bush has led trade missions to Brazil, Mexico, Israel, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and the United Kingdom. More than 700 business leaders representing Florida companies have participated with Governor Bush in previous missions and are expected to generate more than $450 million in new business as a direct result of the trips.


Florida's trade missions are organized by Enterprise Florida, the state's public-private economic development organization, overseen by the Governor's Office of Tourism, Trade, and Economic Development. Governor Bush serves as chairman of Enterprise Florida.

I'm sorry Governor.  Apparently the Orlando Sentinel cleans out their

Meanwhile, ask your staff to check out the bottom of the State/Local for the

       Privitization will work with dcf only if the new contracting businesses do not hire dcf workers. This is the problem here in Broward.  Lockheed Martin, just like Perc, hired former dcf and food stamp workers who have the experience on paper working for dcf, but who carry forth the same old philosophy that has ruined dcf's reputation.  I work with these people and this is a statewide problem. 

Nan Rich will continue to complain no matter what you and Regier do.  She is a heavy democrat here.  Where was Nan Rich when the problems started?  These problems existed during Chiles' days as Governor.  The fruits of the poisonous tree.

It is ok to increase the salaries of those case workers who do their jobs.  But the people determining the case worker is doing her job usually does not even know what the law is and furthermore, does not care.  Attitude adjustments are needed.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I wish to take this opportunity to once again thank you for your strong support of the Transportation Disadvantaged Program in the State of Florida.  As an honored appointee to the CTD, It is extremely comforting to know that our Governor's office is mindful of the needs of disabled individuals, like myself, who rely daily on this innovative concept that is gaining recognition daily at a National level for its successes.
 
As always I remain confident and grateful in your ability to lead our fine State on a smooth road to equality and independence for all Floridians.    With all that you face on a daily basis and the tough decisions that will need to be made during this session, your recognition that HC 03-02 posed a threat to an already under-funded program in two deeply hidden sections is remarkable and I am very honored to be working on behalf of your office in my present capacity.  
 
Since I believe that there is no need to "preach to the Choir" -- as the late Bishop John M. Allin often reminded me while under his charge -- I will simply conclude with the note that my prayers are with you and your family as this year progresses.  The need for transportation services that are affordable, accessible and flexible are without question and to belabor it further would be in conflict with your schedule.
 
Faithfully,
Brenda-Ann Gillis
Commissioner
Florida Commission for the Transportation for the Disadvantaged
President/Founder of 20/200 Fellowship, Inc.
 
P.S.  Our kids in the after-school program to reinforce braille literacy skills, truly got a kick out of your autographed pictures.  There was plenty to go around, and the Board of Directors truly appreciated you taking of your time to let them know that reading braille counts!  I also understand that our organization got an "A+" in the Mentoring Program!  Thanks again for the time and thoughtful consideration.

F schools receive more money per student than D schools. D schools more than C. C more than B. B more than A. Those are the facts. The students showing the greatest progress are the ones of lower income. That is a fact. I hope you have a great week.

Gov. Bush-Which "underperforming schools" receive more money?  Do "C" and "D" schools?  Or just "F" schools?  Can those schools give their teachers "this benefit" too? Do you really think the teachers at my son's school, labelled an "A" by your bureaucrats, are better than teachers at the school 5 miles away that teach more kids from broken homes with less educated parents and from immigrant families who've only been speaking English for 3-4 years? Does your son, the one who taught for one or two years in Miami, really think so too?

The underperforming schools receive more money per student than the schools with higher grades. The school recognition money goes to schools that improve as well as though that receive an A grade. I do believe that teachers deserve this benefit. I am sorry that you don't.

Gov. Bush-I oppose this policy and respectfully disagree that it is "a proper reward."  I believe it is ignorant and simplistic, at best; immoral and unethical, at worst.  It overwhelmingly goes to schools with children of college graduates before schools with children of janitors.  Since my religious upbringing taught me to follow a great teacher who said, "What you do to the least amongst you, you do to me,"   I cannot, in good conscience, be a party to it anymore. That's why my son didn't take your stinking test last week.

I would oppose eliminating school recognition money. More than half of this money goes to teacher bonuses and it is a proper reward for the improvement taking place in Florida schools.

Dear Gov. Bush,
 
I hate to bother you but I do not know where to file a complaint against AOL in our state government.  I've never had any problem with them (have been with them for many years) till they billed us for 2,300 dollars regarding a limited price plan we NEVER chose.  We think when they hire someone one of the criteria's must read 'must have no logical, reasoning skills to be hired by AOL'.
 
I'm sorry to bother you with this but I just do not know where to file one and I felt you or one of your staffers would.  Check out www.badbusinessbureau.com for more complaints such as mine which I found after hitting the 'net' trying to find out if these were normal practices of AOL.
Thank you,

	Irving high school juniors absent on TAKS test day 

	Schools report almost half stayed home
	

	03/04/2003 

	By ERIC AASEN / The Dallas Morning News 

	IRVING – When schools distributed statewide tests Thursday, nearly half of the juniors at Nimitz High School didn't show up for class. 

	A lack of interest may be to blame because juniors don't need to pass the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills to graduate, Irving school district officials said. 

	"You knew full well they could get into school," Superintendent Jack Singley said, dismissing last week's ice storm as an excuse. "They didn't take...[the test] seriously." 

	Irving's absentee rates may be the exception. High schools in the Garland, Grand Prairie, Plano and Richardson school districts reported normal absentee rates. 

	A Dallas Independent School District spokesman said he had not heard reports of unusually high absences but that precise numbers were not available Monday night. 

	The Texas Education Agency is awaiting data from districts. Depending on the number of absences, the agency may launch an investigation. 

	Of the 463 juniors at Nimitz High, 223 – or 48 percent – were absent. About 33 percent of the juniors at the Academy of Irving ISD, 21 percent at Irving High and 20 percent at MacArthur High were gone. 

	Last semester, about 5 percent of high schoolers were absent on any given school day. 

	Mr. Singley said that the high absentee rate is unusual and that the district is investigating. 

	"It bothers me a lot that you have that many students gone from school," he said. 

	The district didn't discourage students from taking the test, he said. Nimitz's principal, Sam Bean, could not be reached for comment. 

	Juniors are the final class of students who must pass the older state standards test, the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills, to graduate. 

	The TEA won't know how many missed the TAKS until May, when it receives data from NCS Pearson, the testing contractor. About 250,000 11th-graders were scheduled to take the TAKS. 

	The agency doesn't have a policy to address test-taking attendance rates, said Adrienne Sobolak, the agency's deputy director of communications. 

	"It is to a campus's advantage to make sure that as many juniors as possible take the test," she said. "An investigation is more likely to happen if it appears to be that there was a low rate of attendance for no reason other than the fact that children decided that they didn't want to take the test because it didn't count." 

	The TAKS test was given to 11th-graders for field-testing purposes, Ms. Sobolak said. The state wants to use data from the junior class to set benchmarks and help schools prepare this year's 10th-graders for the TAKS next year. 

	Texas students in grades four, seven, nine, 10 and 11 took the TAKS last week. Attendance rates in the Irving district were normal or near normal for the other grade levels, school officials said. 

	"Schools were doing their very best to give students an incentive to take the TAKS," Ms. Sobolak said. "And for whatever reason, some schools weren't as successful at getting the kids inside." 

	Staff writers Holly Warren, Louise Applebome, Jennifer Arend, Kim Breen, Kristine Hughes and Bill Lodge contributed to this report.

Dear Terri,

I look forward to attending your meeting in Orlando and speaking to your
group if you wish.  Please give me an idea of when and for how long.

Regarding the Universal Pre-K constitutional amendment, the Governor and the
Commissioner recognize that there is much to be considered and many voices
to hear as we move forward to implement. 

The laws in Florida protect your right to homeschool your child, and give
you a variety of assessment choices. Let's work together to keep that
unchanged.

Sincerely,
Alex

I would really appreciate insights here.  Once again, HEF has been
acting without any input from the homeschool community -- and the only
reason I have even an inkling of that is because this "alert" came out
only after correspondence between HEF and the FPEA surfaced as the
result of an internet virus that sent out private correspondence to
different addresses.  Without that note having come to light, we would
have had to wait far longer to learn this much.

Please help me understand this alert and its implications, and if this
is, indeed, a correct interpretation of the legislative issues facing us
currently. 

Thank you.

Terri

P.S.  I'm still waiting to hear back from Dr. Williams regarding her
plans to speak at LIFE Fest.  Are you still planning on attending, J.C.?

            ADVERTISEMENT
           
     
     My Groups | HEF_Info Main Page  
     


Legislative Update and Request for Action:



Background:  The Home Education Foundation (HEF) and the Florida 
Association of Academic Nonpublic Schools (FAANS) have been 
concerned about the direction that the Legislature and the 
Governor's Office is taking on Universal Pre-K.  You might be 
wondering why this is an issue of concern for home educators.  Well, 
nothing happens in isolation here.  I am greatly concerned about the 
Voluntary Universal Pre-K Issue for the following reasons:



1.  The Governor and others want accountability.  They do not want 
it to be government supported day care, so there has to be an 
educational component.  The question we all are wrestling with is 
how you measure that for 4 year olds.



2.  Many of us who have a developmental approach to education know 
that basing accountability on outcomes puts a lot of pressure on 
children and programs.  At the present time, those people who are 
trying to separate pre-school from day care programs are pushing for 
a pre-test and post-test to measure a 4-year old's progress toward 
reading readiness.  This seems to be the lesser of two evils when 
the alternative is to control or mandate accreditation, teacher 
certification, or curricula.  



3.  FAANS and HEF have been talking to experts in early childhood 
education about assessment, testing and measurement.  There are more 
problems than solutions in measuring a 4-year old child's progress 
in readiness to read. 



My concern is that leadership and school choice representatives want 
this to be a completely voucherized program.  Since the beginning of 
the voucher movement about 3 years ago, we have observed a 180 
degree turn in philosophy.  The proponents were at first arguing 
that private schools are accountable to parents for the education of 
their children and Florida Statutes support this position.  (Florida 
has compulsory attendance laws not compulsory education laws.)  
However, with government money flowing to private schools indirectly 
through students on vouchers, leaderships want to make sure that 
those state dollars are spent wisely.   We have been fighting to 
maintain our autonomy and independence.  I can tell you from what I 
am seeing here that if the Legislature makes the Universal Pre-K a 
voucher program and imposes state-chosen assessment on these 
programs, in the very near future state assessment will be imposed 
on recipients of other scholarships.  



So, you may say, people can choose if they want to take a voucher 
and the FCAT, then they should be able to do so.  In the short time 
since the scholarships became a reality in Florida, the State has 
started pressing private schools to police themselves and reveal 
information about the school.  The State's interest in this 
information has never been an issue before. Private schools, until 
this past summer, were separate and apart from the public schools.  
The line between the two has almost been erased.  Once private 
schools come under the same accountability as public schools, there 
will be no real choice for parents.  Believe me, after having worked 
with state government, both inside and out, if the private schools 
have to use the state assessment (FCAT) to prove to the public that 
they are providing the same "high quality" education as the public 
school, home educators will not be left alone. We would be the only 
educational delivery system not required to measure progress with 
the FCAT.  Remember the phraseology "All children can learn" and "No 
child left behind," that is being used at the state and federal 
level.  At both levels, dollars are being used to entice parents and 
schools into these programs.  Once it is in place and private 
schools agree to use state assessment, then it will be imposed on 
all.  The Ohio Association of Independent Schools filed a lawsuit 
against the state when state assessment was imposed on private 
schools.  The court ruled that state assessment did not violate 
their freedoms.  The situation is a little different than Florida 
since private schools are chartered in Ohio and issue state 
diplomas.  



With the new philosophy of a single system of accountability, 
imposition of the FCAT to receive a high school diploma, and denying 
students access to public post-secondary   education, I could easily 
see Florida private school students and home education students 
being denied admission to state post secondary schools if they did 
not pass the FCAT. 



We are not there yet, but we can't wait until there is a bill in the 
Legislature that would do that.  I could see the problem with 
private schools taking vouchers 10 years ago and told them what the 
pitfalls were.  No one believed me then.  Just two days ago, one of 
the members of FAANS told me that after a tour of some of the 
schools accredited by his association, he could not believe how 
dependent some of the schools were on scholarship dollars.  Once the 
schools become dependent on state dollars to survive, they will 
agree to anything the state requires.  So, it is with home educators.



Folks, we are very close to seeing state assessment imposed on all 
educational providers in Florida.  I am fighting as hard as I can to 
keep private schools and home education programs separate from the 
scholarship programs.  If the regulations are put on the scholarship 
programs, then private schools are free to choose to participate or 
not.  If the regulations are placed on all private schools, we will 
be watching the demise of all real choice and independent education 
in Florida because the FCAT controls the curriculum.



I need your help this Session to fight this issue.  I don't want to 
create hysteria, but your help on this issue is very critical.  
Lobbyists are NOT being allowed to set appointments with the 
Speaker. The Governor and Commissioner of Education are extremely 
busy this time of year, and legislators who are new and do not 
understand the history and issues of education in Florida. That is 
why the appointment of Dr. Penn Williams was so frightening.  She 
was hired to advise on all independent education which includes 
scholarships, charters, home education and private schools.  We are 
not all the same.  If the Department of Education and Dr. Penn 
Williams does not see the distinction, we are in serious trouble.  



I may be asking you to make calls on issues this Session which you 
have not traditionally considered home education issues.  In those 
cases, it would be best to identify yourself as a "CONSTITUENT", as 
legislators listen more openly to those without a pre-conceived 
agenda.  ONLY call your own legislator or get friends to call who 
live in that district. I usually contact home educators living in 
specific districts when I need them to contact legislators, but time 
is of the essence.  Things are moving too quickly to handle these 
alerts individually.  Two very critical issues are up in committee 
on Monday, and I just found out on Friday afternoon.  I can't get 
around to see all these legislators who  will be traveling in the 
morning and have committee meetings in the afternoon.  We must get 
word to their offices before the committee meetings begin at 3:00 
pm.  These issues will affect home educators sooner or later, and it 
is alarming to see how quickly all this is moving.  



Here is what I need you to do on PCS 193- on Universal Pre-K.



Send this out ASAP to members of your group.  They may not live in 
the legislator's district, but they may know people who do.



Call or email before 3:00 pm Monday, March 10, the following members 
of the PreK-12 Committee.



Ask Committee Members to support PCS 193.  Tell them that the 
Universal Pre-K Issue needs more study and ask them to support the 
study by the Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government 
Accountability.

Ask Committee Members to Preserve the Office of Private Schools and 
Home Education.  Tell them that the law requires DOE to collect 
certain information regarding private schools and home education, 
but these are not part of the public education system.  The choice 
programs that have been created by the Legislature are public school 
options for parents of public school students.  They are funded by 
public dollars, whereas private schools and home education programs 
are funded with private dollars and do not receive state funding.  
Therefore, the Office of Private Schools needs to be separate from 
the Choice programs.

Tallahassee, Florida

Dear Mr. Metty:

I attempted to leave you a voice mail message this afternoon but I do not think that the message was delivered to you in its entirety.  We have a child participating in the John M. McKay Scholarships for Students with Disabilities Program.  The participating private school requires partial payment of tuition prior to the start of the academic year to reserve our child's space for next school year. The private school, at our request, and in accordance with Section 1002.39, Florida Statutes, contacted the Choice Office to request payment in advance prior to the first quarterly payment of the year to be deducted from subsequent scholarship payments to cover the partial payment of tuition required.  It is our understanding that Section 1002.39(6)(a)3.(c), Florida Statutes provides, in pertinent part:  

       (c) If the participating private school requires partial payment of tuition prior to the start of the academic year to reserve space for students admitted to the school, that partial payment may be paid by the Department of Education prior to the first quarterly payment of the year in which the John M. McKay Scholarship is awarded, up to a maximum of $1,000, and deducted from subsequent scholarship payments...

Apparently the Choice Office staff informed the private school staff that the Department of Education has opted not to honor requests for "partial payment... prior to the first quarterly payment of the year in which the John M. McKay Scholarship is awarded, up to a maximum of $1,000, and deducted from subsequent scholarship payments..."  in direct contrast to what we understand Section 1002.39 provides for.  

Needless to say, that if partial payment is not provided (the need for this is recognized by Section 1002.39 of the Florida Statutes), the ability that families with children with disabilities may have to reserve space in reputable private schools for their children would be significantly jeopardized and children with disabilities would not be able to compete for space in reputable participating private schools because of financial reasons.  This is a privilege that only a few financially solvent families will be able to afford.  Rather than increasing the access of children with disabilities to the John M. McKay Scholarships Program, this will serve to limit and decrease the access to the Program.  This is an issue of great interest, both at a personal and at a professional level.  We want to see more children with disabilities opt for the McKay Scholarships Program.  This is the only program available at this time in Florida that can provide children with disabilities with real and meaningful educational opportunities and where parents can hold schools accountable.  The John McKay Scholarships Program was precisely created in recognition of the failure of our public system of education.  Our public system of education has failed miserably to provide children with disabilities with the free appropriate public education that they are entitled to receive.  The public system of education for children with disabilities has not been accountable to anyone, much less to the parents of the children it is supposed to serve.   The denial of a free appropriate public education is especially significant among poor families.  The McKay Scholarships Program cannot be allowed to become an "elite" program, only accessible to those who have the financial means to pay expensive registration fees upfront in reputable private schools.  If Florida does that, then rather than being a leader in this field, Florida will be perpetuating the failure of the public school system by failing to provide access to education under the McKay Scholarships Program to poor and middle class children in Florida.  I think our legislators understood that not all families, especially families who have children with disabilities, can afford out of pocket registration fees and that is why the law provides a way for the Department of Education to pay these fees in advance.

A written clarification is kindly requested at your earliest convenience.  

Sincerely,

Dear Ms. and Mr. Diaz:

 

Thank you for taking the time to contact me regarding the implementation of Section 1002.39 (6) (c) Florida Statutes which states:

 

(c)    If the participating private school requires partial payment of tuition prior to the start of the academic year to reserve space for students admitted to the school, that partial payment may (emphasis mine) be paid by the Department of Education prior to the first quarterly payment of the year in which the John M. McKay Scholarship is awarded, up to a maximum of $1,000, and deducted from subsequent scholarship payments. If a student decides not to attend the participating private school, the partial reservation payment must be returned to the Department of Education by the participating private school. There is a limit of one reservation payment per student per year. 

 

Clearly, this provision allows, but does not mandate reservation payments.  The Department has chosen not to pay reservation payments for several reasons including financial accounting and administrative issues.

Dear Governor Bush:
     As the parent of two teenagers of whom I proudly consider to be very 
bright,It's been a comfort to know that Florida has such a good
scholarship plan in the Bright Futures Plan.  We also contribute to
the Florida Prepaid Plan. Compared to other States these are both excellent 
Plans.  We want our kids to stay in Florida, and we want all the bright kids 
in Florida to stay in Florida when they graduate.
Brainpower is the most important economic resource for Florida's
future.  These programs go far to prevent a "brain drain" to States
"up North". I know budgets are tight,but please try your best to keep these 
programs as is.

                      Sincerly,

Dear Governor:

    I hope my input in January helped your team with a smoother transition.
I look forward to continued work with your folks in the education
department.

    Because of your obvious and incredible record in Florida on education
reform, I am writing to tell you that CER would be honored to salute you and
the progress of your state in education reform on the occasion of our 10th
Anniversary celebration, coming up this fall, on October 29.

    We plan to have a wonderful gala celebration that will shine the
spotlight on the best of reform efforts in the last ten years.  The
accomplishments of the myriad people who have created the successes in
standards, accountability, choice and charters in the Sunshine State lead
our list.

    The event will draw the major leaders and grassroots players of the
reform world, in addition to key people from the nation and the
Administration.  It will be big, exciting and eventful.  It would be a great
place to tell the Florida Story and helpful for people  in your state to get
acknowledgement for all of their hard work, as well as let others know what
it takes to be successful.

    You'd make my year (really) if you'd agree to keynote the event and
receive our salute on behalf of those you lead.  The rest of the event is
still in development and we will build on your involvement if you agree.

    Again, the CER 10th gala is October 29, at the Ritz Carlton in
Washington, DC.  If you have questions or would like to advise me on the
next step we should take, I'd love to hear from you.

    Thanks so much. God Bless,

    Jeanne

Jeb, Crisha Scolaro, parent and founder of Pepin and a long time friend

past employee asked me to visit Pepin several weeks ago because they
wanted
me to see the school and have some understanding of the crisis they are
going through. Pepin is an award-winning model Charter school for the
learning disabled 6th through 12 grade. They only take the most
difficult
student with learning and emotional problems.  Their funding is high per
student. It appears that the district and the DOE are in a fight with
Pepin
regarding funding and the looser will be the kids who Pepin has been
able
the help. If the funding is cut, I am told the school will close. And
audit
is underway and it looks like they are on a witch hunt to change the
student
classification and therefore the funding level. The school can't figure
it
out. Anything you can do to help? Dick

Subject:	OPPOSE

I am emailing my Governor and Representatives in Tallahassee to let you all know that I oppose and feel threatened by the $2.25 million cut proposed for the  Ringling Museum.  State funds, my tax dollars are essential to operations at the Ringling. Please do not cut this money from TRUST FUNDS already earmarked for cultural institutions like the Ringling.  The museum (actually three separate museums) is the "State Art Museum of Florida."
This cultural powerhouse as you all well know helps drive S.W. Fla's tourism economy.  The Museum's link to FSU has meant new leadership and financial support buoying the spirits of all who care and encouraging undertaking a major private capitol campaign to enrich programs offered and help the funding of buildings under construction and proposed.  Any reduction in state operating funds right now would be a huge setback for THE RINGLING MUSEUM.
 
AS A  TAXPAYER AND VOTER I AM A OPPOSED TO THIS PROPOSAL.  PLEASE DO NOT CUT THESE NECESSARY FUNDS.

I'm sending this to let you know that I am very upset and shocked to think that there is a proposal in the new budget for a cut that would gravely impact the operation of the JOHN AND MABLE RINGLING MUSEUM.  I realize that you and my representatives in Tallahassee face the difficult job of trying to balance the state budget. Please OPPOSE the $2.25 million cut in the Ringling's budget.  
The trust funds that have been earmarked for cultural institutions like the Ringling should not be put on the cutting block for many reasons.  The first being that The Ringling  is a treasure to the State of Florida as it is the official state art museum.  
This year alone the Ringling welcomed 350,00 visitors (l00,00 more than last year). Visits by students and children alone has increased by 25 percent. The Ringling, is one of the nations top 20 museums and a powerhouse of culture that helps drive S.W. Fla's tourism and the state taxes paid by tourists are important to the economy of the state.  Any reduction in the operating funds right now would be a huge setback.  At this crucial time when the Ringling has undertaken planning and construction for  three new  and expanded buildings and and a major capitol campaign in order to raise private dollars to enrich the programs offered.  The link with FSU has meant new leadership and financial support, encouraging all who care to begin to see this unique museum (actually three museums) finally start to reach its potential.

Dear Governor Bush:

I take great pleasure in recommending for the vacancy of the Circuit Court 
Judgeship for an outstanding colleague and judge, Karla F. Wright.  I have 
had the opportunity of knowing Karla F. Wright since she became a member of 
the Florida Bar Association.  Judge Wright since becoming a member of the 
Polk County Bar Association has been very rewarding to know that you 
appointed her as a County Judge.  She has quickly grown to be the capable 
judge that we knew she would become.  Her leadership and judicial temperament 
on the bench has been outstanding according to her peers and lawyers that 
have appeared before her.  More importantly, the citizens of this community 
do feel they were getting a fair chance once they appeared before this 
impeccable judge.

Howver, I must point out to you that aside from her demanding task as serving 
as judge, she still committed herself to serve her community.  She set forth 
community efforts prior to becoming a judge to enhance the efforts of our 
youth to become better citizens.  This was demonstrated when she pull 
together, prior to becoming a judge, a county-wide community effort for 
parents, teachers, administrators and business persons to assist our 
community move forth into the 2000 Millennium.  Even though she has been a 
sitting judge since the county-wide effort, she has continued to monitor and 
give directions to our community so we can achieve greatness as United States 
citizen.  Her continued efforts to serve this community even though she has a 
demanding career as a judge is amazing and outstanding.

As the oldest African American Attorney in this community, I have not yet 
seen a more qualified African-American that would be fitting for this vacant 
Circuit Judgeship.  I presently serve as the founding member and president of 
two (2) bar associations and have recommended several judges that you have 
approved.  Karla F. Wright certainly is an outstanding candidate and she is 
recommended highly.

                                                With kindest regards,

Subject: Economic Diversification Initiative




Governor Bush -- 

As we survey the budgetary "landscape" before us, it is becoming increasingly apparent that Enterprise Florida will have to be more aggressive and more creative in raising funds from the private sector.  This has, of course, always been a goal of the organization, but has also been one of our biggest challenges, in that we are targeting the very same companies being courted by our local economic development partners.

This may be a bold step, but I would like to propose a new partial tax credit to induce businesses to invest in the state's economic development efforts that, if successful, will eventually decrease the state's GR investment in EFI.

The attached memo outlines how the program would work, but the premise is to provide businesses that invest in EFI up to a 75% annual credit on either corporate income, intangibles, insurance premium or sales tax liability, not to exceed a half-million annually.

I realize this is a difficult time to discuss tax changes, but I believe the program is a win-win for everyone ... the program has the potential to create a more stable funding source for the organization -- which will further your economic diversification goal and will benefit partners, investors and the state -- and, over time, the Legislature will have the flexibility to reduce its direct contributions to EFI as needed.

I would welcome the opportunity to meet with you to discuss the proposal in greater detail, but thought you might like to review the idea in advance so as to advise me if you think it has merit -- particularly in this legislative session. 

I look forward to your comments.

Jeb Good Morning,

 

 

As the Lt. Governor will be leaving office.

 

Please do not put in the former Mayor of Orlando Glenda Hood.

 

Tony Jennings would be great and another good one would be Jacksonville Mayor Delaney.

 

 

Have a great day, and a better week next week.

 

Plan to see you the end of March. Lunch with the Bishops and the Red Mass on March 25.

 

Corinne E. Steinbauer

Jeb,

I do not understand your comment about fighting the Federal Government.
Wasn't it the State of Florida that imported the manatee to fight the
Hyacinth problem in the canals?

We are fighting the Federal Government to bring about commonsense
regulation to protect the manatee. I agre with you that we can find the
proper balance between access to the water and protection.

Subject: manatee




Dear Jeb,

I was at a wedding a couple of weeks ago and found we had a mutual
friend.
She  told me of your personal love of manatee. We seem to have similar
likes
since one of our fondest memories is having a mother give birth to her
calf
in our boat house. It was an educational, and heart worming, experience
for
the whole family, neighbors, and friends. The Manatee family still after
several years return to our dock regularly during the summer for fresh
water
and they love Saint Augustine Grass. Manatee jewelry and T-shirts are  a
"given" on all special occasions.

Although I support the Manatee protection program, it is my opinion ( as
one
that lives on the water inhabited by Manatee ) that the current boating
restrictions, under the pretense of Manatee protection is very counter
productive and may have very negative impacts, especially on the younger
members of our community.

For the past several years during the summer the neighborhood kids would
gather in our "backyard" and plan their strategy for the days adventures
on
the water. Weather it be fishing, wake boarding, or just plain
exploring. It
did my heart good, as I left for work,  to see 8 or 10 boys in their jon
boats at sunrise ready to get out-on-the water. With the current boating
restrictions this has stopped and the video arcades are doing a booming
business.

Last year the boys would wave down the Marine Patrol and discuss where
he
had seen Red Fish tailing, or where to avoid because of Manatee
activity.
Today the Marine Patrol are avoided and the "bad guys". Not healthy!  I
was
taught the policeman is your friend; not to these boys!

 I've heard a lot of rumors, and  know  there must be  some real
political
or legal issues driving the boating restriction issue that I do not
understand. But as a resident that has spent 30 years on the affected
waters, I can tell you there are more Manatee today than there have ever
been. And recreational boating is NOT a threat to the species.

The point of this note is to ask haw we can go about amending the law to
allow local kids to run their 9HP or less boats in these areas when
school
is out this summer.

Thanks, Brian Malin Sr.

We would like you to know that we both strongly recommend the appointment of Frank Mann to the Board.  We believe that the Board will be greatly enhanced by Mr Mann's participation.

to the governor:
 
Jeb Bush: 
 
i have worked at the ringling museum for over ten years as a volunteer...the tax cut to the museum being suggested is unconscionable...for so long the museum has been neglected by the state of florida.  it is one of only four state museums in the united states and has been underfunded for decades.  now, there is an opportunity to establish the museum on a firm financial footing and urgently we ask that funds be granted to the ringling and KEEP THEM THERE.
 
 As you face the difficult task of balancing the state budget, I urge you to support appropriate funding for The John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art in Sarasota. Please oppose the proposed $2.25 million cut in the Ringling’s budget. Don’t cut this money from trust funds that have been earmarked for cultural institutions like the Ringling.

	The Ringling expects to welcome 350,000 visitors this year-l00,000 more visitors than last year. Attendance by students and children, alone, has increased by 25 percent since 2000. The Ringling, one of the nation’s top 20 museums, is a cultural powerhouse that helps to drive Southwest Florida’s tourism economy. During these difficult economic times, the state taxes paid by tourists are especially important to Florida.

	While the Museum’s link to Florida State University has meant new leadership and financial support, any reduction in state operating funds right now would be a huge setback for the Ringling, the official state art museum.

	The proposed cuts come at a crucial time when the Ringling has undertaken planning and construction for three new and expanded buildings and a major capital campaign to raise private dollars to enrich the programs offered to the community.

       I want to express total support on your call for a revote on the bullet train and class size referendums.  The impending financial dilemma is exactly why the voters also passed the financial disclosure measure.  It makes total sense to revisit those two elephants.
Not one company in the world would agree to a new investment or operating change without rationalizing the annual and total costs.  Not one community in the world would ask voters if everyone should have a free PET scan to detect unknown cancers at an early stage.
The referendums without costs were a joke from the start.... as you've always maintained.

SAS Dubina advised that this morning a bomb threat was received by Sarasota County via a payphone alleging the Skyway Bridge was the target.  The Florida Highway Patrol checked the bridge span and the Coast Guard the underside of the bridge and pilings with negative results.  Vehicular traffic was not impacted, however, the shipping channel was closed for a short period of time.  
 
The SW DSTF is investigating the source of the call.
 
The Department of Homeland Security was notified in case there was any media attention.

professions.  We need to look outside of the box.  It takes 1 year to become
a LPN. It takes 2 years to get an associates degree in social work and 3 1/2
for a bachelors degree in education.   DCF sorely needs good caseworkers.
Remember,  when I was on welfare over 20 years ago, I went to college and
got a B.A. in social welfare after only 3 1/2 years. I worked 20 hours of
work at the college.  If I could do this, many other welfare moms can and
should be given the opportunity.  Workforce agencies throughout the state
should be referring welfare recipients with high school diplomas  to state
colleges. Welfare moms and dads are eligible for pell grants and school
loans.  

This way, workforce agencies might have more money to spend on clients who
are not suited for college. I believe there would be more money to be
allocated for support services.

 Broward County Workforce is far ahead of the other counties in the state in
placing welfare moms and dads in training programs. However, not enough
welfare moms and dads are actually placed in educational components that
would help them reach authentic self-sufficiency.  The state of Florida has
a gold mine in these people and needs to see them as such. 

I hope to hear from you regarding the above. Thank-you.

	Hoping this is the correct email for you Kevin,  I called a few
weeks ago and asked for documents that indicate the number and  % of
Workforce One Broward cases that receive education and training benefits.
The chart I'm looking at is dated September 18, 2000, and we have a few
others for different dates.  The only title is "Open Wages Cases."  I would
fax the form, but ours is a laminated trial exhibit,  which is blown up.
Please send me whatever information you have which reflects the number of

Thank you very much for your assistance.

defense attorney for most of the last thirty years.  He is also one of the most qualified attorneys that it has been my pleasure to know. He was city attorney during my twelve years as city manager in Cross City, and I know him as a colleague and most importantly as a friend.  He is uniquely qualified
to serve as our county judge, and I will appreciate any con-
sideration given him.  As an aside, he can validate your sel-
ection should you appoint him, because he is very electable.

Just a few positive notes.

As a Director, I make every effort to implement and hold true to your goals, one of them being diversity in state government.  We have a total of 11 staff (3 - ADAWG, 3 - Clearinghouse on Disability Information and 4 in the Olmstead grant project) and within that we have 1 person from Cuba, 1 from Puerto Rico, 1 from India who worked hand in hand with Mother Theresa in Calcutta in the leper colonies, 1 person who is Chinese and we have a staff person that has adopted 2 Chinese girls.  Within the 11 we also have a person who is visually impaired, a person who uses a wheelchair (polio) and is brain injured, and 2 people with hidden disabilities (lupus, etc.).  

The Clearinghouse is doing great.  We are now averaging 3,000 calls a month.  The local Crisis Service in Tampa that is open 24 hours 7 days a week does 3,700 a month.  We are almost matching that in 5 days, 8:30 - 5.  We don't just give people phone numbers.  We complete research on certain requests and assist with laying out a step by step action plan for the person when they are trying to get resources for state, local, etc., needs as one example.  When someone calls for help maybe with their electric bill, even though we know what programs provide that assistance, we will call first and make sure there is money available then rather then sending them somewhere that can't help them.

I finally feel we are making good progress with the STO on Section 508 implementation.  Kim is providing a good foundation and a clear commitment. We are training all of their managers on the standards this week and the techniques.  I am also seeing a quick response from the STO on accessibility issues that come up in MyFlorida.  For example, the way the voting for quarters was originally placed on the web site did not allow people with disabilities using screen readers to vote very easily.  They fixed it very quickly on the same day.  That is why the training is necessary so things like voting for the quarters will go up right to begin with.

I have written too much. Sorry.  Take care.

Of Florida


Dear Governor Bush:

My husband, Dr. Eli Rose and I are Board Certified Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists.  We moved to the Tampa Bay area in 1975.   There was a major 
liability crisis the very day we opened our office.  We called our friends in 
N.J. and were able to obtain insurance.   In 1980 there was another crisis.   
In 1990 our combined premium would have been $130,000.  We have never been 
sued in Obstetrics.   We have delivered over 10,000 babies.   We decided to 
quit Obstetrics.   In 2002 our insurance company left the State of Florida.   
If we retired on 8/31/2002 we would have had tail coverage for life.   If not 
the insurance company wanted us to pay $65,000 each for tail coverage and and 
additional $25,000 each as premium  making our premium a total of $180,000 
for Gynecology alone.  We managed to find coverage for the year 2003, but 
like thousands of other Florida physicians we are tired of paying extortion 
money for the privelage of being sued.   Although we are too young to retire, 
it is time to quit.   A very good friend of ours who was a defense attorney 
has gone over "to the dark side" and become a plaintiff's  attorney and his 
reason was simple " there is no money in defending doctors".   Conjure up a 
frivolous  lawsuit  and they have hit the lotto jackpot.   So it is time for 
us to retire.   It is projected that 50% of physicians will leave the State.  
 When trauma units /cancer facilities /transplant centres/cardiac units start 
shutting down  where will the critically ill go?   The impact is far 
reaching.   Tourists do not wish to vacation in a State in which their 
medical needs and perhaps their lives hang  in the balance.   Our 
Universities and Medical Schools are suffering.This bill needs to be 
supported.   Sincerely,Janet A. Marley, M.D., F.A.C.O.G.

I have never written to any government officials ever... so I will try to be to the point.

CUT OUT GIFTED PROGRAMS TO REDUCE CLASS SIZES FOR EVERYONE!
The gifted program creates inequality among students, and creates unfair social standing.  If they are "so much smarter", they don't need the smaller class sizes, extra money, or special previledges and field trips.  It is not fair, the average and above average students are ignored in our schools.  

REVIEW THE HIGH SPEED RAIL VOTE COUNT.... IT WAS ON THE BACK OF THE BALLOT AND MISSED BY A LOT OF VOTERS!!!!  
i.e. Look to see how many voted for items on the front of the ballot vs. the back.  I missed it and I was going to vote NO!  It should be re-voted for this reason alone.

I hope this letter is read... please reply so I know it was recieved.

Subject: RE: PCS 193- on Universal Pre-K 

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Godshalk

The intent of the voluntary Pre-K is not to be a "daycare," but to offer a
quality pre-kindergarten environment to little ones.  As this is a brand new
amendment to our constitution, there is still a great deal of deliberation
and study about just how this imperative can be best implemented.  There
will be many diverse voices at the table as these decisions are made.

That said, please be assured that the Governor, the Commissioner and I are
committed to more quality choices for children and their parents - not more
government and regulations. 

In terms of the FCAT, this assessment tool is administered to students in
grades beginning in third through tenth. Passing the FCAT is not, and never
has been, a criterion for the Bright Futures Scholarship.  This Scholarship
is based on a combination of students' GPA's and either SAT or ACT scores.
Only one scholarship program offered to students via private schools
requires that students take the FCAT; that is the program ("Opportunity
Scholarships") which allows students from failing public schools to choose a
better (usually private) school to attend. Administration of the FCAT is one
way that the parents of those children can know that their children are
indeed doing better.  The principals of schools accepting "Opportunity
Scholarships" do not alter their excellent curricula because their
"Opportunity Scholarship" students take the FCAT. Good teachers, along with
rigorous curricula in which strong basic skills are taught, will produce
excellent student achievement - hence, good FCAT results. 

The laws in Florida protect your right to homeschool and/or to send your
child to a private school; these are YOUR RIGHTS and YOUR CHOICES.  Let's
work together to keep that unchanged.

Sincerely,
Alex Penn Williams

Subject: PCS 193- on Universal Pre-K 

Dear Dr. Penn-Williams,

As before, thank you for taking to time to hear our concerns.  Some things
have been brought to our attention that we would like you to clarify for us
and correct any misinformation and/or give us guidance.  It concerns the
Universal Pre-K and how it will affect our home-school family and others
like us in the future.  The following is what we understand might affect our
home-schooling future as a result of this issue:


1. Will Pre-K be voluntary, will it be like daycare, or will there be
accountability and how will be that measured for 4-year olds?

2.  Will this be a "voucherized" system?  How will this affect private
schools that accept state money under the voucher program because a 'public
school' parent chooses that private school and will that require them to
undergo state assessment (FCAT)?

3.  If state assessment is required for private schools in the future, will
recipients of other scholarships (Bright Futures for example) be required to
have undergone state assessment (FCAT) to qualify for those scholarships?
Will this extend to home educators?

4.  If so, will we, as home educators, need the FCAT to have access to state
post-secondary education?

As you can see, this all leads to our most important question.  Will we, as
home educators, lose our freedom to choose an independent education in
Florida because FCAT controls the curriculum?

We feel the Universal Pre-K issue needs more study.  As we understand it, by
law the Department of Education is required to collect certain information
regarding private schools and home education, but it is not to be considered
as part of the public education system.  We also understand that the
'voucher system' or 'choice' programs have been created for public school
parents to CHOOSE other options.  Should this then mean that private schools
and home educators, who do not ask for or receive public funding, but who
pay taxes and spend private dollars for their choice, should have our
choices jeopardized?

Please work to preserve our choice!  Keep the Office of Private Schools and
Home Education separate from the Choice Programs!

Thank you so much for your time.

Governor Bush,

It was a pleasure meeting you last week and we would appreciate any support
you can give us with regard to our pending FCC matter.   Rick Salzman has
sent some additional information to Greg Turbeville and he will continue to
discuss this issue with him.   

As we discussed at our meeting, during the past 7 years we have built our
company from zero to now, over $400 million in revenue.   We can compete
with all of the big wireless carriers, but now we also have to battle with
Washington.   Unlike most companies in our industry, we are growing at 20+
percent rate and we generate free cash.   In addition, we are continuing to
hire more people in Florida.   We firmly believe that any version of the
proposed $1 flat Universal Service Tax is illegal and certainly it is not
fair to lower income, lower spending consumers.   It is similar to charging
the same dollar amount of tax if you go to the Palm Restaurant or to
McDonalds.  If this change was adopted, it would cost us a minimum of $24
million a year and it would be devastating to our ability to grow and
prosper.   Ironic, since we are really the only true universal service
provider today.  We offer service in every market that has wireless service
and we subsidize rates in rural markets to offer one, simple rate plan
nationwide.   With TracFone you can maintain service for under $7.99 a month
and everyone qualifies.   

Once again, it was a pleasure meeting you and if you can support our
position on this matter it would be much appreciated.   Thanks and feel free
to contact me if you have any questions or would like to get together on any
of your future visits to Miami.

Governor Jeb Bush
PL 05 The Capitol
400 South Monroe Street
Tallahassee, FL 32399-0001


Dear Governor Bush:

You are our pro-education and pro-business Governor and we know you are a very busy man.  However, we are desperate for your attention.  Specifically, we are F.L.A.M.E. (Florida Association Of Massage Educators) a group of private massage schools who are committed to doing what is best for our special industry.  The Board of Massage is under the Department of Health and your control. 

The Board of Massage has increased the minimum required program hours for private massage schools from 500 to 700, effective July 2004.  None of the Board Members has been able to provide sufficient reason for the increase beyond personal beliefs and biases.  Ethically, we want to honor our Board.  We teach our students to respect and obey Florida's laws and the Board of Massage. However, we cannot understand or support this decision for reasons provided.

F.L.A.M.E. has repeatedly offered the board evidence that the current requirement of 500 hours is sufficient for entry-level massage therapy and that no significant harm is being done to the public. The NCBTMB exam, currently being used as the Florida State exam for entry level Massage Therapists, requires the applicant to have completed a 500-hour program in order to be tested. There is currently no plan to eliminate the 500-hour NCBTMB exam as our state exam because the majority of the 30 states that regulate Massage Therapy accept 500 hours. In addition, 500 hours is the industry standard for schools not offering Federal Financial Aid.  Please take a moment to review the attachment from the NCBTMB regarding our graduate pass rates on the board exam.  These pass rates make it evident that the overwhelming majority of private schools are doing an excellent job educating their students.
  
Our schools are in eminent danger of either closing or needlessly becoming dependent on federal money.  The Board of Massage has overstepped their mandate to protect the public from harm and decided that the minimum hours of education required in the state of Florida must increase to 700 hours. This action will unnecessarily cause a major increase in the cost of tuition in private schools.  Public Massage schools in the state of Florida stated that they could not effectively teach Massage Therapy in 500 hours and are currently required to teach 750 hours at extremely discounted tuition rates.  As private schools we are operating on real cost budgets.  We fear that the resulting increase in tuition caused by an increase in required hours, we will no longer be able to compete with the Florida Public School System and thus go out of business or, worse, become dependant on federal funds. 
We are encouraged by the fact that you are a regular patron of Massage Therapy.  As you may know, Massage Therapy includes more than 400 modalities.  This demonstrates the rich diversity that each private school has the opportunity to embrace.  Some of the schools in F.L.A.M.E. have been effectively teaching Massage Therapy for over 20 years.  We ask that you carefully consider this matter and offer us your support and assistance.  Thank you in advance for your time.  Please contact Michael McGillicuddy at your earliest convenience by phone at 407-719-2347.

below did not explain is that he held a sign that (he had made at a sign
shop so it would look professional) until he could not stand any more.
He then held it until he could not sit any longer. This was after his
chemo and radiation each day until the election. I wanted to let you
know how much it meant to him. He spoke of your conversation to every
person that visited him on his death bed. They were all impressed how
you could take time from your extra busy schedule to call such a simple
person, even my Dad. My father Joe passed away last Friday. He died with
no pain and perfectly coherent. Even in our own last conversation, he
told me how much your call meant to him. He did not have to ask me to
support you for the rest of my life because he knew I would. I and all
my family will always remember you and honor you for making my fathers
last few months that much more special. I will support you no matter. I
have never met you but will be eternally thankful. I would do anything
in the world to pay you back for that special moment.

Eternally Grateful,

Dear Jeb,

I need you help with a very compassionate situation that pertains to one
of your most devoted campaign workers. Earlier this year Mr. Joe Warren
was diagnosed with terminal cancer and given about 6 months to live by
his doctor.

Knowing that he would die before he ever imagined, Joe Warren was moved
by your message to dedicate his last few months of life to your campaign
and inspired his family with great emotion to do the same. 

Mr. warren stood out at the intersection of US Hwy 17 and SR 16 in Green
Cove Springs Florida and waived your signs day after day, spreading a
message of hope that he believed in. A victory by Bush/Brogan meant a
legacy to his family when he is gone.

Mr. Governor, I know that in his final days he has a wish that only you
can fulfill, which is a personal telephone call with a word of thanks
for his devotion. Joe Warren is man of very few words, and will not keep
you more that a minute. But it will be a minute that will be treasured
for a lifetime by the entire Warren family.   

Joe Warren's Cell phone# (904) 349-6761

Governor Bush:

I have purchased two tickets for the March 28th Literacy function in Bonita Springs. I would like to support this organization.

I would love the opportunity thank you, in person, for my new son Craig.  Once again, we would love for you to be his God-Parent, since you did save his life.

We are so excited to have DCF off of our backs and they have not even contacted us to congratulate us on the adoption. Nice.

Nevertheless, if you can possibly time one minute to let me shake your hand and tell your Parents what a beautiful thing you have done, give my husband and I a family!

Looking forward to seeing you on the 28th.

Dear Mr. Governor:
 
I would really appreciate five to ten minutes of your time to talk about the issue of childhood obesity and the possibility of reviving the Governor's Council on Physical Fitness.  You have a number of agencies (Health, Education, Agriculture, Sports Foundation) that are working on independent efforts to address these needs, but there is no central point of coordination or a clear mandate to promote both physical fitness and good nutrition.  As the centerpiece of this effort, I'd like to launch a FitFlorida initiative that recognizes schools on physical fitness and nutritional measures.  Our mutual friend John Thrasher calls this a white hat issue--this should be good for Floridians and shouldn't cost too much money--but I need your help and blessing in putting this together.
 
You are also probably aware that I am chairing the Select Committee on Article V.  If you would ever like information on that issue or how the House is working to implement Revision 7, I would be happy to brief you.  
 
Thank you in advance for your help.

Hi, Governor
I'm forwarding you a copy of and email I requested, so I could show Mrs. Keels what was going on. I don't  know where you are on this, I was asked to be a speaker at the(Seminar). I would like to go and help people understand this process better, not as a supporter of them but as and educator. God gave me this mission when your staff showed me how to do this, and what I became from this. All felons are not like me don't think they have a chance out there on their own.  They don't no they can do this with being counted and I would like to let them know this. But I need your help I need to speak with you at some time, to get your view on all of this. I feel this is  apart of faith base helping other, as god has help me through you. I know you're doing  a lot to speed thing up, but this could get ugly for our presidential reelection. If I don't go in and try to be and example for what your goals are for restoration, of the whole man. I'm not Martin Luther King who did what he had to do. I took a stand for you because my father in heaven told me to not that I didn't want to but  I  was scared of the phone call I received from black leaders. I don't ask for big things from you , because you don't owe me anything. But just want you to listen to me and show me the way, and give me a chance to help nonviolent  offenders become like me. Through God, faith base, my voice, you, and  my vision to stand program.  
 
My media attorney in Tampa  David Stamps(Fowler White) will do a press release for me and will be their with me.

Are you ready to end the injustice of felony disenfranchisement?

Robert is well qualified due to his being a practicing attorney and active citizen of Dixie County for thirty years.  Robert is a "giver" to all community projects and the only applicant from our county.  He knows our people and their problems and would serve us well.  He is also very electable and can hold on to the job if appointed.

Dear Sir:

As you can see by the letter sent to you and me the Department of Motor
Vehicles can't do anything -- as I suspected when they contacted me after I
wrote you --- I already went that route -- they say it will take an order
from the judge.  the judge agreed to this order -- but no one can provide me
with one -- we are not from there and Florida can't because it is there.
Even Eric's probation officer has thrown his hands up!.  As I said --
Because Eric received his ticket in another state -- he cannot even get
limited driving privileges in this state.  He is not and has never been from
NC -- but he is and has been living in Florida for four years now.  Now
there are people with second and third offenses driving to work in this
state (but I guess they are lucky because they got their ticket here) and
Eric had a first offense, never any other offense -- a misdemeanor in
another state causes him to not get this request.

Sir, please this still needs to be looked at closer.  If driving is a
privilege -- then it should still be looked at the fact that it is now six
years old -- even though the day of "conviction" was Oct. 7, 2002 -- this
was NC's doing -- the appeal dragged on five years!.  What can be done.  He
could lose his job -- this is all so wrong.  Please what else can be done?
Can you contact the judge in North Carolina -- the only thing that can be
done is to now it seems is to have him reduce his sentence and remove the
suspension as time served and good behavior.

Telephone contact below, however my cell phone is 850-261-4490 if you miss
me at my office.

This is the letter sent by DMV and a cc: to you
Dear Ms. Hoffmann:

After a member of my staff called you, we contacted the state of North
Carolina and verified that Eric Dupre is currently suspended for one year
effective 10/07/02 for driving while impaired.  Since North Carolina does
not have a hardship license provision, they will not and cannot issue Mr.
Dupre a hardship license.  We also tried other possibilities, but the laws
of the state of North Carolina are very clear and do not provide any
opportunity for restricted licenses for this type of suspension.

As long as Mr. Dupre's driving privilege is suspended in the North Carolina,
we cannot issue him a Florida driver's license even on a restricted basis,
since we have a reciprocity agreement with that state (most states share
this agreement), and we have to honor that agreement.

I'm sorry that we cannot give you a more favorable reply.

Subject:	RE: Unanswered questions and Miami Edison's Great Loss

 Governor Bush-I don't ascribe bad motives to you, just ignorance and
arrogance.  I am a teacher at a school your bureaucrats labeled a "D."  I
and most of my colleagues have been motivated for 14 years(despite meddling
politicians like you) and the man that is our principal is the epitome of
dedication.   What is missing is community support, for many, many reasons,
some simple (they're too tired, or they're working) and some complex (don't
value education-dysfunctional family problems).  On parent nights we have
5-10% turn-out!  WHOSE ACCOUNTABLE THERE??? On the other hand, my son is a
math and reading whiz, and I can tell you it's not mostly because of his
teachers, IT'S BECAUSE OF ME!  Until you get that-that it's a joint thing
and parents should be held accountable too, you may have complacency from
teachers, but little respect.  
	Finally, if you really believe schools are improving, you're more ignorant
than I thought you were. Even if test scores are rising, and the way your
Orwellian DOE operates, who the heck knows if they really are or if they
even mean anything, you remember what Mark Twain said about lies and
statistics.  But if they were improving, wouldn't that correlate with a
rise in other indicators, say, SAT scores? 
	No, Governor, I don't ascribe bad motives to you anymore than I ascribe
them to your brother.  I'm beginning to wonder,however, what your mother
taught you two to do when others disagree with you.  Neither one of you
seems to be willing to listen much to opposing views.  I guess when you
have the big bucks you figure you don't have to. At least you're only at
the helm of this state, and while you're doing much damage, at least you
won't be responsible for ruining America's moral standing in the world,
thus making my kids and grandkids more vulnerable to terrorist attacks, or
have the blood of innocents on your hands.

Hola, 

Haven't bothered you for awhile-  things are going great here in Bloomington, but missing all of you terribly-  I particularly miss los pastelitos y los sandwhiches cubanos!  How are things in my home state-  by the way I love the quarter you selected!!!!

I am being highlighted in a State Farm corporate publication called ALFI for an article on associates involved in the political process, the article is kind of a "call to action" for our other associates to get involved.  In the article we would like to include a picture of me and I want to use a picture I took with your mom during your first campaign at a fundraiser in Sergio Pino's home-  (it was when she first published her book)- anyway in order for me to use the picture I need your authorization-  so if this ok with you can you just reply to this e-mail that you are authorizing me to use the photo for this article.  Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Mil gracias,

Thank you for writing to my office. 

Sometimes on issues of great public interest, it is not uncommon for legislators to receive thousands of e-mails. 

I personally read every e-mail message that is sent to me, but sometimes it takes awhile to get through them all. Also, due to the time required to remain current on the hundreds of bills and related issues, it is occasionally impossible to personally respond to them all.  

In order to assure a personal response, please provide your full name and mailing address.  

Thank you for allowing me the privilege of serving you in the Florida Senate.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
 
I am concerned about the services that are in danger of being cut by our State. In particular is is the Community Care for the Elderly. My Dad has been using these services and currently has had a major heart attack. He is very ill and can't leave our house.
I recently had two charter schools close for political reasons and now I am unemployed and can't make it on what I am getting until I am able to get a job. On top of that I am going through a Divorce.
Please see that these services don't get cut. He and many elderly people need this to survive.

A G.O.P. Freshman's Crash Pad...and His Dem. Colleague's 1BR

March 9, 2003
By AMY BARRETT 




 

Tom Feeney, 44, loves the convenience of his
500-square-foot studio, a block and a half from the
Capitol, ''but I never want to think that it's my home,''
he says. Home is a 2,600-square-foot house with a pool in
the Orlando, Fla., suburb of Oviedo, where his wife and two
sons, ages 4 and 10, live. ''Tommy is coming for spring
break,'' he says. ''This place is perfect for a
10-year-old. He'll probably clean up after me.'' 

How he chose the apartment: ''A former staffer got a list
of cheap places to see, and this was the first one. We
pulled up at 1 o'clock, and by 1:18 I had signed the lease.
I'm a real-estate lawyer by trade.'' 

Who picked the furniture: ''The bed and dressers were left
over from my Tallahassee apartment when I was speaker of
the House there. The futon bunk bed is the only thing we
bought.'' 

Reason for the bunk bed: ''I have buddies come up and stay
over -- as long as they don't snore too loud.'' 

What he brought from home: ''A bedspread with the Penn
State colors, blue and white. If I left it at home my wife
would let the dog lie on it.'' 

Morning routine: ''Everybody knows that unless the
president of the United States calls, I'm not doing
breakfast. I'm out running four miles.'' 

Evening routine: ''My office is more comfortable than my
apartment, so I'll just sit in there until 10 or 11
o'clock, watching TV, catching up on reading. The office
has everything I need except a shower.'' 

Typical breakfast: ''Diet Coke -- that's it.'' 

Where he
eats dinner: ''There are a couple of restaurants in the
area -- the Capitol Hill Club, a Republican club, and the
Hawk and Dove, a dive bar with chicken wings and French
fries.'' 

Favorite late-night snack: ''A couple of candy bars or some
Oreo or chocolate-chip cookies.'' 

His last meal would be: Crayfish and Budweiser. 

What he
watches on TV: ''The news or old movies. And I'm a hockey
fan, so sometimes I watch that.'' 

In his CD player: ''I don't have a CD player here, but I'll
listen to anything except rap. I like folk -- Joan Baez,
Bob Dylan. And I love Fleetwood Mac and the Doors.'' 

Mode of transportation: ''At home I have a Nissan
Pathfinder. Here, there is always someone from staff who is
anxious to drive me around. They want some time alone with
you to tell you what they're doing.'' 

Cleanliness obsession: ''I have seven toothbrushes. I have
to brush my teeth several times a day.'' 

Electronic device he can't live without: ''I'm not a
computer nerd or anything, but I've become a BlackBerry
addict.'' 

Favorite shoes: ''Cowboy boots from Dan Post Boots in El
Paso.'' 

Where he shops for clothes: ''While I was running for
Congress, I bought five or six Brooks Brothers shirts at
the Reagan National airport. But generally I'll go shopping
once a year, at the Men's Wearhouse sale.'' 

Frank Ballance, 61, left a two-story house on 17 bucolic
acres in Warrenton, N.C., to spend his workweek in a
550-square-foot apartment in Hill House, a building near
the Capitol where some 40 members of Congress live. But the
former small-town lawyer is looking on the bright side.
''At least I have a place where I could invite three or
four people around to talk about serious issues or just
play pinochle.'' 

Morning routine: ''Most times there's a breakfast meeting.
I'm seeing Liddy Dole tomorrow. But if I'm eating on my
own, I'll have Welch's grape juice and cheese toast. Not
the good cheese. Those Kraft slices are the easiest to
melt.'' 

Favorite item in the apartment: ''The Serta Oxford
mattress. I can't sleep on a soft mattress -- I wake up all
bent over in the morning.'' 

What he brought from home: ''The TV. Even if I'm not
watching it I have to have a TV on.'' 

Least favorite thing about the apartment: ''The fifth floor
gives me a decent view, but it's too far to walk up. I'm
going to try to get in shape, though, because there's a lot
of walking around here.'' 

Workout: ''I used to do sit-ups and push-ups, and I had a
treadmill at home until it broke down.'' 

Household chore he needs to get used to: ''I've been taking
my dirty laundry home and bringing it back clean. I got my
detergent here and ready to go, though. Tide.'' 

Who picked the furniture: ''My wife, Bernadine, bought
everything. It was way too much money -- about $5,500. I
said, For God's sake, please, don't buy anything else!'' 

Typical dinner: ''I've been buying myself these
microwaveable meals -- Alfredo chicken and some kind of
burger and macaroni. I just go to the freezer and see which
pictures I like best.'' 

Bedtime: ''11:30 p.m., but sometimes I watch Jay Leno. He
bashes Clinton a little much for me, but other than that
he's got some funny lines.'' 

Best gift he has gotten recently: ''The clock radio I use
is from one of the staffers at my old law firm. Now down
here we've got to be careful about the $50 rule. I'm sure
the peanut folks from my district will supply me with
peanuts pretty soon, though, so I have something to give to
my guests at the office.'' 

Favorite TV shows: CNN and ''The Practice.'' 

Favorite
book: '''An Even Chance in the Race of Life,' about George
Henry White. He was the last black person in Congress at
the turn of the 20th century. I read it once straight
through, and now I'll go back and look at it.'' 

Favorite musical artist: Bobby ''Blue'' Bland. 

Place he
dreams of traveling to: ''Africa, again.'' 

Guilty pleasure: ''I don't have bacon and sausage much, but
I love that.'' 

Means of transportation: ''I have a little foreign car -- a
Mercedes 420 -- but it's 3 hours and 15 minutes by car to
my district, so I may ride the Amtrak a good bit.'' 

When he gets homesick: ''I get on the telephone. I've got
more phones than you can shake a stick at.''

Gov. Jeb,
Perhaps, I can say it better.  I know that daily you have tons of information to absorb.

Lack of consideration or planning for sustainability in the RFP and initial funding process is a waste of public resources.

Good programs go down the tube and programs are always scrambling for government funding solutions rather than local solutions.

Insurance Hits Builders Hard
By DAVE SIMANOFF dsimanoff@tampatrib.com 
Published: Mar 12, 2003
   
TAMPA - After 33 years of building roofs, houses and stores in Florida,
Marty Hand says he can't afford to stay in business any longer. 
Hand, owner of Golden Globe Construction & Development Inc., said he is
being forced to shut down because he can't find affordable workers
compensation insurance. 

He said his current insurance carrier, FCCI Insurance Group, won't
renew his policy because it's pulling out of Florida, and his only
alternative - a policy with the state's Joint Underwriters Association -
would be prohibitively expensive, more than doubling his bill. 

It's simply too much money for his ``mom and pop organization'' - him,
his wife and an additional employee or two when necessary - he said. 

``Little guys like us can't afford to come up with that kind of
money,'' he said. ``Our alternatives are kind of grim. We may be forced
to shut down.'' 

Small construction companies across Florida, and their peers across the
state, say they are being squeezed by oppressive workers compensation
insurance costs. Workers compensation insurance covers medical costs for
employees injured on the job, and it is required to do construction in
Florida. 

Workers compensation insurance rates vary and are based upon workers'
salaries and what kind of job an employee does. Coverage for a carpenter
costs an employer about $41 for every $100 paid in salaries, according
to trade groups. For a roofer, the premium costs about $51 for every
$100 in salaries. 

Representatives from the Tampa Bay Builders Association and the Florida
Home Builders Association rallied for workers compensation reform
Tuesday morning. They called on lawmakers in Tallahassee to improve the
system so insurance carriers would want to do business in the state and
so employers can find affordable insurance . 

``It's really time to have workmen's compensation reform,'' said Eric
D. Isenbergh, president of the local builders group and Tampa-based
Premier Design Homes of Florida Inc. 

Three years ago, a study by the Oregon Department of Consumer and
Business Services found that Florida was the most expensive state in the
nation for workers compensation premiums, by a margin of at least 21
percent. 

The call for reform comes during a residential housing boom, fueled by
historically low interest rates and a lack of attractive investment
alternatives. Isenbergh said the housing industry represents one of few
bright spots in an otherwise dismal economy, but ``it's being threatened
by the workers compensation crisis.'' 

Labor expenses usually account for nearly half the cost of a building,
Isenbergh said. When a contractor is forced to pay higher premiums for
workers compensation insurance, that cost gets passed to the customer. 

Isenbergh said the rising costs mean the price tags for town houses
he's building in Brandon are ``a good $10,000'' more than they would
have been a few years ago. That increase might prohibit people from
buying houses, he said. 

``You're knocking out affordable housing.'' 

Some builders are forgoing workers compensation insurance and
performing work without the proper permits and licenses. 

``In 40 years, I have never seen as much unlicensed activity as I have
now,'' said Rodney S. Ficher, executive director of the Pinellas County
Construction Licensing Board. ``A lot of people are doing this because
the costs are so high, because we don't have a system that works.'' 

The builders organizations aren't pushing for a specific set of
reforms. Instead, they are hoping to convince legislators that the
existing system costs too much and provides too little return. 

They are also asking that the Joint Underwriters Association lower its
costs. The state builders group said JUA coverage costs twice as much or
more than coverage from a traditional insurance carrier. 

Michael Hickman, president of Hickman Homes Inc. in Lakeland and
incoming president of the Florida builders association, said legal and
medical costs have driven up the cost of insurance coverage. Any
meaningful reforms would have to address those issues, he said. 

Hickman also stressed that employers in other industries, such as the
medical field, are falling victim to higher workers compensation
insurance costs. 

It's likely that legislators will take up the issue of workers
compensation this year. 

A panel appointed by Gov. Jeb Bush has been studying the issue and
developing a proposal to reform the system, and state Rep. Dennis Ross,
R-Lakeland, is heading up a House committee on the subject. Also, the
Department of Insurance is discussing ways to improve the workers
compensation process.

MEMORANDUM

             the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund, State Lands

RE:       Broward County Beach Nourishment Easement/Consent of Use/Waiver of
             Survey Agenda Item (Cabinet Meeting, March 25th)


Preface:  We understand that this item was deferred from your January 28th meeting to the March 25th meeting.  We note that action on this item on March 25th is contingent upon passage of legislation to be signed by the Governor to rectify the voting requirements for this and other items.  As of this date, this legislation has not yet been finalized and it is uncertain when it will be.  In the interest of fairness to those of us who are under-funded, under-staffed and already traveled twice to Tallahassee for this issue, we respectfully request that this item not be heard by the Cabinet Aides without providing us with at least 14 days notice prior to their meeting so that we may try to secure somewhat reasonable travel arrangements for both the Cabinet Aides' meeting and the subsequent meeting of the Governor and Cabinet.  


       We are writing to simply request that we get the most economically sound, scientifically supported by the best science and data available, environmentally sensitive, least negative impact, long-lasting, more natural solution to the man-made problem of beach erosion in Broward County.  The project that will be presented to you again on March 25th still does not meet these basic requirements.  Basically, all the concerns we have raised to you, reprinted below, have not been addressed.    

       We look forward to your leadership and direction in this matter to demonstrate your announced commitment to preserving and protecting our natural resources and environment (as well as our multi-billion economic engine represented by those who come to enjoy our precious coral reefs and our fabulous oceanfront beaches and communities).  We thank you for your recent decision regarding the protection of our reefs as it relates to the laying of fiber optic cables.  We appreciate the fine work of your DEP staff relative to the proposed natural gas pipelines.  You have clearly demonstrated fine leadership on these issues.  We hope you demonstrate this same type of leadership as it relates to the Broward County beach dredge & fill project.      

       The Broward County Beach Dredge & Fill Project that will be presented to you again on March 25th still does not represent the best product.  

The project before you does not include:

--implementing the less expensive, long promised, more natural, and proven longer-term sand bypass solution for the beaches south of Port Everglades as we have done at other Ports (there is no commitment from the elected officials of Broward County to get this sandbypassing project done; in fact, see partial transcript provided below of recent Broward County Commission meeting held on the very day you were considering this item (January 28th) where clear opposition to this sand bypyassing project was put on the record)

--installing sand dunes and vegetation which will stabilize our beaches 

--stopping all stormwater runoff from our major concrete buildings and parking lots that now drain on the beach into the ocean which increases the likelihood and rate of erosion (see attached photographs)

The project before you includes:

--killing of a minimum of 24,725 corals

--killing of turtles, some of which are threatened and endangered

--burying acres of hardbottom, coral, reefs and juvenile fish habitat and foraging grounds for endangered sea turtles

--jeopardizing the health of many more acres near dredge sites given turbidity caused by equipment and wave action

--increasing likelihood and rate of erosion on northern beaches by taking sand from offshore of Deerfield and Hillsboro beaches and putting it on southern beaches

--dredging and filling during turtle nesting season jeopardizing turtle survival rates

--spending taxpayer unwisely on a project that has very short-term benefits  

--increasing the cost given the need to mitigate for the destruction noted above 

--introducing exotics into our oceanfront environment by using limestone boulders from the Bahamas on which to transplant corals in the hopes of creating man-made reefs for the ones we are destroying  

       Broward County needs to do better.  Broward County does not have a State of Florida mandated Manatee Protection Plan.  Municipalities within Broward County refuse to develop a turtle lighting ordinance as required by Broward County Ordinances borne out of the State Comprehensive Planning Process and guidelines within State documents.  Broward County, is home to municipalities that refuse to allow the planting of beach stabilization vegetation (which Broward Soil & Water Conservation District, USDA has offered to do for FREE) to hold the sand once it is pumped on the beach because "it will block the view."  Broward County, is home to shore front properties that openly drain stormwater runoff into the ocean increasing the rate of erosion and polluting our waters.  Broward County issued letters threatening oceanfront property owners with condemnation in order to increase the rate of funding from the Federal government.  Broward County is home to recent health and no-swimming advisories given pollutants in the waters.    

       The project before you does not resemble a more natural, long-term solution to our man-made erosion problems with a bypass at Port Everglades and stabilizing vegetation.  Instead, the project before you will destroy our environment (killing corals, reefs, turtles, habitat) for temporary wider bald beaches on which to place more lounge chairs on what are technically (maybe not legally but technically) private beaches (e.g., the 39 story, 1000 room Plumber's & Pipefitter's Union hotel).  We wonder if this is the wisest way to spend our scare public taxpayer dollars.

       Trustees, we deserve better.  Our environment deserves better.  Our economy deserves better.  All of Florida and the Nation deserves better.  We do not have the best product before you.  We hope you will insist that we get it.

       Remember:  You're shaping the next 100 years to come.  This is YOUR LEGACY!  

Partial Transcript of Broward County Commission Meeting held January 28, 2003 (at the same time you were hearing us on this project)

Commissioner Rodstrom:  and, the sand bypassing, I'm under the impression that we're not proceeding with that at the moment?

Steve Somerville:  No, we are Commissioner.  In fact, we have invested, we and the state of Florida have invested almost three quarters of a million dollars into that project; we have a contractor on board, consultant on board that's doing the feasibility and analysis work to make sand bypassing a reality.

Commissioner Rodstrom:  that's not on, I didn't see that on the agenda today.  This is really a contract with the folks that are going to be dumping the rocks.  

Steve Somerville:  Yes, that's a separate project

Commissioner Rodstrom:  Yes, that's a separate project.  Okay, well, then, I'm okay with the project but I will just say publicly that I continue to be opposed to the sand bypassing.  I think that when you dig that trench in front of Point of The Americas that you are in unchartered waters and when you see that building cave in to the Intracoastal Waterway and tip over, you know, look out.  And I think that there are other solutions that are far less expensive, whereby elongating one of the jetties to accomplish the same thing, at least some of the studies that I have seen and I would avoid sand bypassing at all costs.  To me, I think it is a waste of money but I'm going to support the reef because it is our intention not to destroy any reefs...

Photographs of outfalls

The following photos are worth 1000 words, but here are a few hundred words to set the scene.  
The TOPIC. Why is there no sand in front of the Diplomat area? But sand further north on Hollywood's beaches? Why are we spending over $50 million to take North Broward sand to this South Broward area? The answer may be a number of factors, but one known major problem is not in the new $50 million corrective action plan.
Are the buildings themselves, who need a sandy beach, washing their own sand away? 
Most say "yes." Those who work on the beach in Hollywood, and those walk the beach have known for years that a major problem is that there are drain pipes from many buildings that empty right on the beach and WASH the sand away. We have been asking for years to get the drainage pipes from the buildings in the "South Broward hot spot" capped. Water is constantly draining onto the sandy beach, and as the water travels to the lowest spot on the beach, the ocean, it takes the sand with it. Soon there is an east/west gully at sea level. The constant natural wave action enlarges the gully, until there is no more sand. That is the case now in the Diplomat area. 
Why does the County not include in the Beach Renourishment Plan, the need for closing-off the drain (outflow) pipes that empty right on the South Broward beaches? (Please note, there are no outflow pipes on those place that are not as seriously eroded. Curious?)
Many keen, long time, observers say this is one major reason there is no sand in the South Broward/Hollywood region. They have watched this occur over the last few years. 
The solution is simple, but has a major cost to the private buildings themselves.  
There is no component in the County plan to require these buildings to reverse the flow of their drains, either onto their (off beach) property, or to drains that would more properly take it to the Intracoastal. (This part of the beach, from Magnolia St. south is privately owed by the upland properties.) "On-property" drainage was an issue with a Holiday Inn expansion plan, and they plan deep wells. 
One look at the first photo, and hopefully you will agree that this is not something that belongs on a beach 
_______________________________________________


The following photographs show the outfalls that are actually exacerbating the beach erosion problems down by the Plumber's and Pipefitter's Union Westin Diplomat Hotel in Hollywood, Broward County. These are the "outfalls" that must be removed if we are truly going to "restore" these beaches.  Of course, we also must have a sand bypass from the north of Port Everglades to the south of Port Everglades to restore our "river of sand," and we must install stabilizing dunes and vegetation too.  But, if we don't stop this runoff into the ocean from these outfalls which are increasing the rate of erosion and polluting our waters, we are NOT going to restore anything!

At the beginning of the year I joined the international public relations firm Fleishman-Hillard to open its Tallahassee office.  I am a satellite of our Miami office and the move into Tallahassee -- we hope -- is the first step in establishing a presence in Jacksonville, Orlando and Tampa.
 
To help introduce the firm to the state and local business community, I am planning to bring to town members of our International Advisory Board for special events.  The first on my list is Newt Gingrich.  I have not established a firm date yet, but I would be happy to schedule his visit in such a way that he can be available to you as a Leadership Forum speaker.
 
If you are interested, please let me know who in your office I should work with to get this scheduled.
 
On another issue, I wanted to tell you that Fleishman-Hillard represents Pfizer on a number of its initiatives, including the Florida: A Healthy State program.  We are looking forward to the opportunity to showcase the terrific first-year results of this initiative.
 
Please don't hesitate to call upon me if I may be of any assistance to you with these or any other issues.  In the meantime, if you'd like to know more about Fleishman-Hillard our website address is www.fleishman.com.

Subject: I-75 Interchange in Sarasota



Honorable Governor Bush:

I am forwarding to you a letter I submitted this morning to the Sarasota Herald-Tribune concerning Palmer Ranch Holdings’ attempt to introduce commercial development into a residential area.  I have underlined and italicized a section of my letter that alludes to the proposed interchange of an extension of Central Sarasota Parkway with I-75.  I am opposed to such an interchange, as it will simply draw traffic into a residential area of Palmer Ranch.  This would impact negatively—and drastically—on home values in this area, as well as increase the air, noise and visual pollution of the environment.  As stated in my letter below, access to the Eastern section of the county can be achieved by a mere overpass at far less cost to the taxpayers.  Please do all you can to stop this madness.  Thank you.  A. Mediavilla

Subject: Palmer Ranch Re-zoning

 

Reader David Mlavsky’s letter in this morning’s H-T (Letters from our Readers, March 12, 2003) exemplifies the misperception about why the residents of Village Walk object to the re-zoning proposed for Palmer Ranch.

We do NOT object to the widening of Honoré, McIntosh and Central Sarasota Parkway to four lanes, even though it will no doubt mean increased traffic past our gates.  Those arterials are sorely needed by a growing County, and will, by the way, make Mr. Mlavsky’s drive through Palmer Ranch less “horrendous,” as he calls it.  Nor do we object the extension of Central Sarasota Parkway so that Mr. Culverhouse can have access to his lands East of I-75.  That is fair and the right thing to do yet does NOT require an I-75 interchange.  Proof of that is Proctor Road.

We DO object to placing 200,000 square feet of retail space in a 30-acre plot in the midst of residential communities.  That is roughly the equivalent of two Wal-Marts, and would have the loading docks and garbage dumpsters less than 900 feet from the folks in Village Walk.  This shopping center, which will be too large to be supported by the surrounding communities, will then become justification for the I-75 interchange, which will further clog up the arterials that Mr. Mlavsky transits, making his drives even more “horrendous.”

One additional factor that perhaps Mr. Mlavsky is not aware of: Village Walk has an integral commercial area within its gates.  Our Village Center, currently under construction (estimated completion date is July/August 2003) will have its own gas station, bank, convenience store, beauty/barber shop, fitness center and tennis courts, deli restaurant, realty office, meeting rooms, post office and other amenities.  The architectural features of this center blend in with the surroundings, is truly pedestrian friendly, as it is within walking distance of most homes in the development, and will also serve as a social focal point for the residents.  Compare that to big-box architecture or stores similarly designed to catch the eye of the driver passing by on I-75!

There is much validity to the “caveat emptor” saying, but what I see in the development plans is an inordinate reliance on the part of the Planning Staff and Palmer Ranch Holdings on a plan that was conceived over 18 years ago.  Much has changed in that time--as a newcomer, I admit to being part of the catalyst for that change—but let’s not impugn the integrity of those of us who have chosen to live here in paradise!  As late-comers, we want to share in the peace and tranquility that we have in Palmer Ranch.  Our roads are being widened to welcome more Mr. Mlavskys, who have absolutely nothing to gain, in my opinion, by the injection of more commercial activity into the residential heart of Palmer Ranch.

I’m placing my trust on the Board of County Commissioners to equitably resolve this matter and do what is right!

Dear Governor Bush

My name is Kimberly K. Pierson SS# [REDACTED] I am a board member of the
Orlando outreach for the Blind.  At our February meeting some of our members
wanted to do something for our troops.  We are a Christian group of people
of all races.  As a Christian yourself you know the important of having your
bible.  We also know where ever are troops are at some places it is not safe
to have their bibles.  We want to send as many decks of cards as we can to
our troops.  Now I know your wondering what does a deck of cards have to do
with the bible.  You will understand if you read the old Tex Ritter song A
Soldier's Cards.  www.fathershands.com/cards/index.htm The song tells the
story of how a young soldier did not have his bible while out in the field
so the Ace reminded him their is but one God.  The duce reminded him there
were two books of the bible Old and New testament so on and so on.  I ask
you to read the story it is amazing.  We are asking you to send two decks
sing by you so one lucky soldier will get a deck from the Governor of the
state of Florida and from a man who is proud to have this person serving his
country the way we are at the outreach center.  The other deck we would like
to use for our auction we are having in November so we can raise money to do
things like we are doing for the troops.  We may not be able to fight for
our country however we do pray for our country and for you to make America
safe again and like it says in the bible it is ok to protect you country.
We are proud of you and the work you are doing for the state of Florida.
You have our best interest at heart and we know it.  We may not be able to
serve ourselves but we can support the soldier's there and support the
family they have waiting for them at home.

If you or your staff has any question I can be reach at 407-857-2756 or
407-491-1887.  My address is Kimberly K Pierson 4649 Forrestal Ave Orlando
FL 32806. Thanks for all you do and for helping us help our troops.  A copy
of the song will go with each deck of cards we send plus a letter letting
them know how proud we are of what they are doing.

Thanks you!!

Hello Mr Bush, 
 
I VOTED FOR YOU. Do not let me down by making our credibility as talent agents in Florida become a mockery as every shyster in the state and around the country can then come in, hang a shingle and say they will protect talent, but they really won't.
I taught high school for 30 years and this is my retirement (full time) career. I have been very fortunate to have a lucrative business and with NO advertising other than a business card, website and professional integrity.
The deregulation will mean that integrity, honesty, and protection for talent and the consumer , will go out the window. Civil suits will prevail and many other unforeseeable injustices will take place.
 
Please understand that the monies the state can put into its coffers would certainly be expanded by adding, not detracting or subtracting officers of the state to track down some of these low lifes who are now thumbing their fingers and noses at those of us who pay our fees and taxes ....when we should.
You can make this happen. Keep us clean and the public safe. 
You will be losing alot of backers, voters, if this debaucle occurs.

Dear Jeb; 
Thank you for seeing our Lee Memorial Health System Board members today, and for being personally concerned about our trauma crisis. 
Frank Mann understands our system because he has previously served as an elected board member.  His insight, intelligence, and networking skills would be a true asset.  I am most happy that he has become a candidate for the appointment. As Board Chairman, I would be pleased to have you name Frank to the vacant seat.

Dear Governor Bush,  
     On February 28 Kimberly Dale visited my fifth grade class at Lillian
Symmes Elementary; the students were thrilled!  She was very upbeat and
positive.  She explained the importance of staying in school, as well as
finding a job you love. (Which, she obviously loves hers.)  You are very
fortunate to have her on your staff!
     My students wanted me to invite you to their Fifth Grade Banquet on
May 28, 2003.  Of course it won't be anything overly fancy, but the wonder
PTA at our school makes it a very special day for the "graduate."  It
would mean a lot to the children if you could attend. (I do realize that
with the crisis in the Middle East things will be rough on you and your
family.  I have mentioned this to the children and they understand.)  If
you cannot attend, would it be possible for someone from your office to
attend?  Maybe even Ms. Dale.
     Your family will be in my prayers during these very trying times.  I
hope things run smoothly for you and your family.
Sincerely,
Stacey Kaminski

Thank you, for your help. Shelly Brantley and I have been emailing one 
another to try to figure this situation out. I am grateful that you do 
take the time to help us, I know you are a busy person. I want to 
stress yet again the importance of new programs. The current ones are 
outdated and underfunded. I know you understand and are doing your best 
to correct this but, I am urging you to do more. To listen to the

The following was sent by a friend and appears to check out (although I have a hard time believing it).  Any of you aware of the underlying law that would allow the DMV to sell information?  If it is real, we may want to send this to all personnel but I'd like to get a read on it first.
 
Subject: Your Florida Driver's License

FYI...

Under a new state law, the Florida DMV has the right to sell and distribute your personal information on file (DOB, SS#, Address, phone number, medical disabilities, etc.) without your permission. However, the law also requires that DMV give individuals the opportunity to block their information (Driver Privacy Protection

Act) from being sold. I went to the DMV web site and noticed my info was not blocked and available to anyone. It took me 20 seconds to block it on their web site. This is only if you have a Florida driver's license. Go to  <https://www2.hsmv.state.fl.us/dlstatus.html> https://www2.hsmv.state.fl.us/dlstatus.html

Once it verifies that your license is valid or not, it will let you know whether or not your license is blocked. If it isn't blocked, it will give you the opportunity to block it at that time by following the instructions. Obviously, please feel free to pass this along to your friends and family in Florida.

Dear Ms. Rennick:

 

I firmly believe the Choice Office has answered all of the questions within our purview, fully and completely, in clear, unambiguous language, verbally and in writing.  It has been explained very clearly that "active IEP" means that the child has not been dismissed from the Exceptional Student Education Program (ESE).  There is no need for further clarification.

 

The John M. McKay Scholarships for Students with Disabilities Program, 1002.39 of the Florida Statutes, states the program is established for "students with disabilities for whom an individual education plan has been written in accordance with rules of the State Board of Education." In accordance with the statute, the student must be identified as a student with a disability and have a current Individual Education Plan (IEP).

 

Your questions regarding services for unilaterally placed students in private schools funded through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, fall properly in the Bureau of Instructional Support and Community Services, directed by Ms. Shan Goff. In my previous correspondence to you, I indicated that a response to your questions would be sent to you by February 12th, I am aware that you did not receive a response on that date. Ms. Goff is also very aware that she did not meet that timeline. Ms. Goff has now completed her answers and I am attaching them for your review.  Our office will also share these responses in DRAFT form with other private schools, soliciting their feedback.  If you have any further questions regarding this specific matter, I would request that you contact Ms. Goff or the Bureau of Instructional Support and Community directly at 850-488-1570. As I have stated previously, the Bureau of Instructional Support and Community Services is responsible for oversight of special education in Florida. It would be inappropriate for the Choice Office to answer the questions you submitted.

 

Your letter insinuates that the Department of Education is involved with "legislative efforts to attack the McKay Scholarship Program."  This is completely false. If you have any knowledge to the contrary, please provide specific information to my office immediately.    The Department has made it clear that the Choice Office has not requested any legislative changes to the McKay Scholarships Program, and we do not feel there is a need for any legislative changes at this time. However, as with any change considered to any education program by the legislature, the Governor and Commissioner will determine our position.

 

I am not going to debate when or where you were personally made aware of the meeting of stakeholders held on February 17, 2003.  Via telephone, I personally made your colleague Dr. Hardman aware of the meeting the week prior to your original letter being sent to the Governor.  Our office followed up this initial contact by soliciting your input and assistance in arranging the meeting.  

 

The Choice Office has scheduled three annual meetings for McKay stakeholders.  We will tentatively scheduled these meetings for February, July and October, as requested by those at the February 17th meeting.  However, due to the Choice Office's limited budget and significant time constraints on our staff, it is probably not feasible to hold the event outside of Tallahassee, until additional resources are available.

 

Every student in Florida deserves a quality education. Improving educational opportunities for all children remains paramount to reforming education and ending a cycle of failure that many children endure throughout their educational experience.  I encourage you to continue to work with us, as well as with other private school organizations and schools across Florida. Only by working together can we craft educational policies that harness the power and resources of the private sector.

 

 

Kindest Regards,

 

 

J. C. Bowman

Q & A DRAFT

Florida Department of Education

Bureau of Instructional Support and Community Services

 

McKay Scholarships: Services by Public Schools

Questions and Answers

 

Background

The following questions were submitted to the Department of Education by the Coalition of McKay Scholarship Schools. These questions, edited to provide greater clarity, and our responses are below.

 

 

Services to McKay Scholarship Students by Public Schools

 

1.      Can McKay Scholarship students receive services/therapies (e.g., speech or occupational therapy) that are funded by state dollars and provided in the public school from the public school in addition to receiving the McKay Scholarship?

 

No. All of the state funding that the student generated through the Florida Education Finance Program (FEFP) for such special education and related services is included in the scholarship awarded to the parent in the McKay Scholarship program.  It is important to note that students attending private schools through the McKay Scholarship for Students with Disabilities are considered parentally placed private school students under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).  As per the IDEA, "No private school child with a disability has an individual right to receive some or all of the special education and related services that the child would receive if enrolled in a public school." (IDEA regulation 34 CFR §300.454(a)).

 

2.      Can McKay Scholarship students receive services/therapies (e.g., academic assessment or behavioral therapy) that are funded by federal dollars and provided by public schools in addition to receiving the McKay Scholarship?

 

As required by the IDEA, each district must allot a proportional amount of their federal IDEA funds for the provision of services to parentally placed students with disabilities enrolled in private schools. The district must consult with representatives of private school children with disabilities to discuss the provision of services.  The results of this consultation must include: 

 

*         determination of which students will receive services;

*	what services will be provided; 
*	how and where services will be provided; and
*	how and when services will be evaluated.

 

Therefore, a district may determine that the portion of the federal IDEA funds will expended for such therapies. Such services must be provided by personnel meeting the same standards as personnel in the public schools.  Students who do receive such services from the local school district are required to have a service plan developed.  The requirements for a service plan include most of the components required in an individual educational plan (IEP) and must be reviewed and revised annually consistent with the IEP requirements (see IDEA regulations 34 CFR §300.453 - §300.455).

 

 

3.      What are the possible legal ramifications for the parent or the McKay Scholarship School for accepting such services?

 

Parents of students with disabilities who are parentally placed in private schools, such as McKay Scholarship students, and who receive services from the local school district via a services plan retain some of the procedural safeguards provided under the IDEA. These include the following:

 

*         Prior written notice, with specific components, must be provided any time a district proposes or refuses to initiate or change the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of a student.

*         Right to inspect and review their child's educational records maintained by the school district.

*         Right to participate in meetings held by the school district with regard to identification, evaluation, determination of eligibility, and reevaluations.

*         Provide consent prior to conducting a reevaluation.

*         Right to mediation to resolve conflicts related to the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of their child.

*         Right to file a formal state complaint that the school district or SEA has failed to meet the requirements related to children with disabilities enrolled by their parents in private school.

*         Right to request administrative due process hearings are available regarding the school district's identification, evaluation, determination of eligibility, or reevaluation of the student.

 

 

Services to McKay Scholarship Students from Federally-Funded IDEA Projects/Grants

 

4.      Can McKay Scholarship students obtain services through statewide federally-funded IDEA projects such as Florida Diagnostic and Learning Resources System (FDLRS), Assistive Technology Education Network (ATEN), etc., that are administered by local school districts, community colleges, and universities, in addition to receiving the McKay Scholarship?

 

Yes.  Federally-funded projects such as those funded by IDEA shall provide students enrolled in private schools by their parents with a genuine opportunity for equitable participation in accordance with federal regulations (see Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) 34 CFR §76.651(a)(1)).  These projects provide informational services to the general public regarding child find and identification, staff development training for teachers, and in some cases, direct services to students with disabilities.  For your information, a listing of these projects with appropriate contact persons is attached.

 




 

Services to McKay Scholarship Students - General

 

5.      Does accepting any of these services make the child subject to mandatory evaluations or possibly jeopardize the autonomy of the McKay Scholarship in any way?

 

While accessing services funded by the school district's IDEA funds through a service plan does not jeopardize the autonomy of the McKay Scholarship, local school districts must comply with the applicable federal requirements for the development of a service plan for the student.  Therefore, school districts may request parental consent for evaluations to determine the type and extent of therapies/services needed.

 

Accessing services from statewide projects funded by the state's IDEA dollars do not typically result in any additional requirements.  However, in the case of unique and specialized services such as assistive technology, behavioral support services, parental consent for an evaluation may be requested by the school district or program to determine the type and extent of technology/services needed.  

 

Regarding reevaluations, it should be noted that school districts are required to notify parents of McKay Scholarship students when it is time for their child's three-year reevaluation.

Dear Dr. Bowman,

 

Thank-you for your lengthy four page response to The Coalition of McKay Scholarship Schools' questions to Governor Bush concerning the McKay Scholarship program and our problems in communicating with your office and DOE.  Unfortunately, your response reminds me of George Bernard Shaw's statement "The problem with communication is the illusion that it has been accomplished."  

 

The Choice Office held a stakeholders' meeting on February 17th which most of the board of The Coalition were able to attend.  Your letter stated that we knew of the meeting prior to our letter being sent. This was not the case.  In fact, we heard of the meeting through another private school administrator and I took it upon myself to call The Choice Office to find out about the meeting.  The only way that our board members heard of the meeting was through my contacts to them.  Many of the other stakeholders told us, at the meeting, that they had less than a week's notice of the meeting.  

 

The stakeholders meeting answered two of the four questions we sent to the governor.  1) There are no longer advisory boards being developed but stakeholders meetings will be held.  The group did suggest to Dr. Metty that these meetings be held three times a year, publicized well in advance, and moved around the state so that more stakeholders could participate.  2)  The second question answered was that the DOE is making no suggestions for legislative changes concerning the McKay Scholarship Program and will not support any changes to the program.  Unfortunately, we know there are legislative efforts to attack the McKay Scholarship Program.  We trust that there are no DOE staff members encouraging these efforts and you will keep abreast of the situation.

 

Our major questions remain unanswered.  On February 7th, when The Coalition received your letter, you assured us that the questions regarding services for unilaterally placed students in private schools would be answered by MS. Shan Goff's office within ten days.  It is now March 3rd and I wanted you to be aware that we have received no answer to the questions we have asked since October 4th.

 

We have continued to ask  for a definition of active vs. inactive IEP.  If a student is not enrolled in a public school in the summer, could a district say they did not have an active IEP?   A definition and an answer would be appreciated.  To reply, as you did, that this was addressed in a "technical assistance document" is not an answer; it is a bureaucratic response.  Dr. Metty said at the February 17 stakeholders meeting that he would address in writing the issue of "inactive vs active IEP's". We have not received this answer at this time.

 

Dr. Bowman, these are not trick questions.  The Coalition and the schools that it represent have, and will continue to have, legitimate questions which we will continue to ask for answers.  As taxpayers and voters, and intelligent persons, we expect to have legitimate replies not bureaucratic responses.

 

Sincerely,

Subject:	our priviledged and confidential business relationship online

Gov. Bush,

Thank you again for that wonderful birthday present of hope that I requested from you, and you gave me -- simply by writing to me, and wishing me a Happy Birthday.

I trust we will  continue  our professional friendship and ownership of intellectual property in a business contract as I  write children's books and other books about your record as governor.

I am writing this letter to assert my right to own and possess the copyrighted materials I own, including my  email to and from you, which I believed at the time was private and confidential, and I trust you knew that too, as well as material I published. 

And, I write to explicity and politely and legally remind all others who may read this that yes,  I am a real FL teacher -- and, yes, a former Dem, and now an independent, who does currently teach  children in a FL public school.

Speaking as a FL teacher, in my view, it would be child abuse, and an intentional infliction of mental injury on children, were anyone to  disclose, publicize, publish or seek to publicize my name, image or idetifying information in any way when I am and continue to be employed as a public school teacher. 

If anyone is reading this who thinks I have authorized the publicity of myself or my students' names onlin e  names, please note I did NOT authorize such names online, nor did anyone who loves children, and that would include my principal, and this governor, and all the parents of our school, and fine citizens od FL.  


However, I have a priviledged and conf idential business relationship concerning intellectual property he has jointly created with me online, through an email disalogue about matters concerning education and other personal matters concerning children.

 and his , whose names and identities are private matters. I have not authorized anyone to post those names, nor the school name, nor my name, nor do I intend to do so now. 

I have always hoped for a formal contract providing you with genuine and real advertising and marketing services -- somet h ing unique which no other politician can obtain, for obvious reasons of defect in those candidates and their falsity. 

But, you are unique and true and always have been -- a very different product to share with others in the marketplace through our int el lectua dialoge.  

I have learned in our three years of writing and my publishing of my true and real thoughts about you and your policies and the highly professional and kind way you always conduct yourself, inspiring others, even those disgarded by o the rs.  

 I trust you will continue to ponder the contractual terms, and write back to me at your convenience. 

Since I own the copyrights, and I have only authorized one forum to publish my work so far, I look forward to continue selecting material fo r bo oks based on our communication. 

This is highly priviledged information, but I feel I must now  assert my authorship and ownership, while ironically asserting and claiming yet again a priviledged and confidential relationship, since I am a teacher o f pub lic school children who do have a right to privacy.   



I trust that you know our three year plus intellectual email correspondence has been one of real value to me as a teacher of children whose names can not be disclosed in public, and thus I co nsider this email to be privilaged and confidential, and anyone disregarding that to be engaging in a deliberate form of child abuse by violating their privacy. 

I also trust you to know, as I do, based sharing online  the responses of your supporters, t hat ou r dialogue has been real -- a truly unique, inspiring, throughtful, and often entertaining dialogue-- one of give and take. Your supporters around the gobe appreciate it, as do I. And, I trust, as do you. 
 

But, I always considered your words and mine o n email to be confidential business matters, protected by a business relationship, evidenced by your repeated public authorization ons a forum for me to publicly represent you. 

As you know, I also trust my image with you, and that's why I think this ema il union works well because we do understand other.
I respect family life, and have no desire to interfer with yours in any way! I also appreciate that you never bother me. It is so refreshing to know that there are, in fact, people like yourself who do n ot need a reason to converse other than intellectual sparks, and I realize not everyone can handle that truth. But, if they'd spend time in a great classroom, then, they'll see it too. 
We have been so fortunate to share our dialogue with thousa nds of oth ers who have read my published works about you. 


 feel I have been amply compensated by the existence of our disalouge, and the give and take we have.  Just as any two business people, we have both performed and we both have duties and obliga tions, in o rder for the contract to continue. 

Gov Bush, In the political party where I came from,I believe  they would not understand this at all - they would not want to recognize a woman in the way  you recognize me and I recoghnize you,. Intellectua l property i s something they discard, over and over again. Evidence? Me! A former Dem, now an independent and a FL certified teacher. 


. accuse and accuse and be sleazy, but, that is because they do not appreciate nor recognize women, in my opinion. If they did, th ey would cheering you now that you have recognized a one-woman ad agency via email,
instead of what I have come to see as their usual boring and inane postings. Not like the email dialogue of intellectual property we have had Governor. Our c urrent busines s relationship is valuable, as are its roots. Their current relationship with women is not nearly as unique, original, real and entertaining as the one you and I have shared only on email.   

 That is why I allow only one political forum t o publish my wo rks, even though others were interested. I control the copyright and no one else. The forum I like makes it clear the opinions of the posters are property of the posters, and no one else. 

And, that is why I am not mentioning this forum b y name nor my sc reen name on it, as I wish to continue te good will that publisher and I already have. 

Gov Bush, you made Florida so proud when you annouced that your choice for FL Lt Gov: Toni Jennings is the first female lt gov in FL.

I don't expect your political opponents will ever understand you, and that is PRECISELY why I wish to continue working for you in a business way online, as I continue to strive for National Certification in teaching, on my own. 

I expect to be at school tomorrow and f or many days and years after that, and when I am not teaching my students and children, I will be teaching others how wonderful you are as governor. 

As my computer has continued to be hacked by person or persons not interested in benefitting your political career, I do not know if my current security settings will work or not, nor if this email will come out the way I intended it. 

But, I trust you know exactly what I mean when I say I trust you, as you have been a governor, a client, and a confident, all online, all a t once, and your base does know and love you for it. Thank you for allowing me to assert my right to copyright my work with you, 

Thank you.

Dear Sir, 

I kept my sample ballet for that election.  Nowhere on my sample ballot does 
it specifically mention the number of students for the various classes and by 
what time this must be accomplished.  It is a generic statement about 
reducing the size.  I would think this is deliberately misleading the voters. 
 Since there were no specifics, how can the voter make a truly informed 
decision.  Surely, this violates something in the election laws.  I live in 
Polk county.  I did not vote for the admendment.

Dear Jeb:
 
It was great being with you at Corpus Christi School on Monday.  You make a great difference and you left the kids highly inspired as to what they can be in life.  For these kids to go home and say that they were with the Governor of Florida is likely to be the highlight of their life.  We all know you beat Eddy Easton in golf and the golf balls were really for all the balls that he loses in the course with you.
 
On a different note, we need you to be the keynote speaker at the US-Mexico Chamber of Commerce Gala Dinner in Miami, which we are planning to hold during the month of April,  you may pick your date.  The month of May is the back up in case you can't make it in April.  This would be a great boost to the Florida-Mexico trade.  This is the third year we have requested this.
 
Jeb, it would be so encouraging for many of us to have you there.
 
Sincerely,

Subject:

LABELING OF MISSING CHILDREN DIFFERS;

DCF, FDLE NOT IN ACCORD ON WHICH TARGETED CHILDREN ARE ENDANGERED.

Byline: ERIC PERA The Ledger

  LAKELAND -- Juan Lara, 3, and Elisa Munoz, 5, both foster children, were
last seen May 16 in Wauchula.
  Are their lives in danger? It depends on what list you see.
  The Department of Children & Families says they are. The Florida
Department of Law Enforcement says they aren't.
  This disparity seems to contradict assurances by DCF that it is
streamlining policies and procedures with FDLE and local law enforcement
agencies.
  Melding efforts of police and social workers to find missing children is a
priority of a panel created by Gov. Jeb Bush after 5-year-old Rilya Wilson
of Miami vanished in early 2001.
  Rilya also is considered endangered by DCF, a term reserved for those
deemed most at risk of abuse or whose lives are in imminent jeopardy.
  Again, FDLE has a different view. It lists Rilya's disappearance as
involuntary. As defined by FDLE that means Rilya is: ''A juvenile who is
missing under circumstances indicating the disappearance was not
voluntary.''
  As for Juan and Elisa, FDLE considers both as having been abducted by a
noncustodial parent.

  Yet the FDLE does list two other children in DCF District 14, which
includes Polk, Highland and Hardee counties, as endangered. They are Kylie
Cates, 4 months, and Alexander Martinez, 4. However, according to DCF, they
are parental abductions and neither is in immediate danger.
  Neither the DCF nor the FDLE could explain the differences.
  Tom Lano, who oversees the DCF's missing children unit in Polk and who
wasn't aware of the disparity until contacted by a Ledger reporter, said he
found it troubling.
  ''There's a problem here,'' he said. ''It appears it (the endangered
label) is being thrown around haphazardly.''
  FDLE Special Agent Terry Thomas, who coordinates the department's missing
children unit, said there's no attempt to follow the DCF's criteria for a
missing child.
  That is left to law enforcement when police enter missing children into
the state's computerized database, called the Florida Crime Information
Center, Thomas said.

  ''We're only concerned with how the local law enforcement (agency) or the
sheriffs enter (information),'' he said.
  Richard Wexler, executive director of the National Coalition for Child
Protection Reform, said the DCF and the FDLE are endangering lives by not
labeling every missing child as endangered.
  Most of the missing foster children are teenagers classified as runaways.
  ''The fact that a child runs away does not mean that child is not
endangered,'' Wexler said. ''Every missing child is endangered until someone
has made a face-to-face check that proves the child is safe.''
  Statewide as of Friday, there were 447 missing foster children -- 384
runaways, 55 parental abductions and eight endangered children, according to
the DCF.
  Of the 21 children missing from the Polk district, 11 are runaways, eight
are parental abductions and two (Juan and Elisa) are endangered.
  FDLE includes missing foster children in its list of all missing children
in the state.
  Of the missing foster children, FDLE says 13 are in danger.

  All children listed as endangered by the DCF are ages 6 and younger, with
Rilya being the oldest.
  The FDLE includes children of all ages on its endangered list.
  Runaways are garnering special attention in the wake of media pressure and
criticism from children's advocates who say authorities aren't doing enough
to find runaways or prevent them from bolting.
  ''Most people are more concerned when their dogs run away than the concern
DCF has shown in tracking them down over the years,'' said Howard Talenfeld,
a Broward attorney and president of Florida's Children First.
  ''DCF operates under a veil of confidentiality, and it's not an emergency
when a child runs or is abducted.''
  In response to criticism, the DCF on Feb. 24 obtained court permission to
release limited information on all missing foster children. Previously, a
Tallahassee judge had ruled the DCF could release only the names of 393
foster children missing as of Sept. 13 of last year.
  That's when Gov. Jeb Bush, responding to public outrage over Rilya's case,
imposed tougher standards for tracking and reporting. She has never been
found.

  Lano began Feb. 1 as the district's missing children specialist.
  Half of Polk's missing children are habitual runaways, he said, children
who have run off from court-appointed caretakers three times or more.
  Lano said a big part of his new job is to explore reasons why so many
children under the state's care run away.
  That includes taking a closer look at foster homes, he said, and working
to put more foster children into the state's independent living program,
where they live alone but under supervision.
  The program, restricted to kids ages 16 and older and who carry a 2.0
grade-point average, ''is cheaper than putting them in foster care,'' Lano
said.
  He said his job is the result of DCF Secretary Jerry Regier's pledge to
overhaul the state's beleaguered child-welfare system.
  In the past, Lano said there was no one at the district level designated
to focus specifically on missing kids.
  ''This is just entirely a situation of focus,'' he said. ''You've got to
have a controller in the station who moves the train.''

  Part of that focus is to streamline the work of DCF and law enforcement to
find the missing children and better document every child upon entering the
system so they can be traced easier.
  Caseworkers are being urged to routinely update photographs, list physical
traits and obtain dental charts, information to be inserted into a foster
child's file, or ''yellow jacket.''
  When legislators convene this spring, they are expected to put together a
plan for including DNA.
  Congress has agreed to fund a $500,000 study to investigate why foster
children disappear and what states can do better to protect them.
  Florida is expected to participate in the study to be conducted by the
Child Welfare League and the National Center for Missing & Exploited
Children.
  Critics question the study's relevance and say the money should be used to
enhance services that help runaways, rather than take the approach of Gov.
Bush, who proposes to reduce or eliminate many services.
  On the chopping block are programs such as the Cornerstone Youth Shelter
in Mulberry, which serves up to 350 runaways a year.

  ''Wouldn't it make more sense to use the $500,000 to actually help kids?''
said Wexler of the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform, in an
e-mail.
  Talenfeld of Florida's Children First, a nonprofit group associated with
Barry University School of Law in Orlando, said Florida's foster children
won't be safe until legislators remove or limit confidentiality protections.
  His group hopes to push through legislation opening public access to
information critical to locating missing children, as well as details of
what the DCF is doing to locate them.
  ''We know they die,'' Talenfeld said. ''They're raped, they commit crimes,
they're victims of crimes and they're certainly not in school.''
  Besides investigating some of the tougher missing children cases, Lano,
51, a former high school English teacher from Minnesota, serves as liaison
to law enforcement agencies throughout the Polk district, including the FBI
and FDLE.
  He also holds classes where department staff meet with law enforcement
officials to review procedures to reduce delays by DCF in reporting missing
children.

  At one such class on a recent Friday morning at DCF's Lakeland
headquarters, Polk sheriff's Sgt. Gary Klinger reiterated the need for
speed.
  ''The first two hours are the most important,'' he said.
  Hundreds of kids escape detection simply because caseworkers haven't the
time to track them down at home, said DCF spokesman Owen Roach.
  Children must be seen in person, he said, but often when caseworkers come
knocking, no one's home, he said.
  Children ages 12 and younger are a priority.
  But DCF officials say they do the best they can to give equal weight to
all children regardless of age, taking care to review progress weekly by
talking to caseworkers and law enforcement officials.

Subject:	Bad events today at SFWMD on Everglades Phosphorus issue...

Jeb:

Our friends from sugar country staged a stealth attack at SFWMD today, with
a well planned move to get the SFWMD board to adopt an unacceptable
position undercutting David Struhs on the Everglades Phosphorus issue.

Working with the sugar contingent and present at the meeting (though they
did not say anything in public) were ERC Commissioners Lisa Tropepe and
Marcia Tjoflat. 

Mike Collins was the point man, and he presented proposed language to amend
a "conceptual water quality plan" to stake out a position that results in
an effective criterion of 15 parts per billion. The way it was done also is
a likely violation of Judge Hoeveler's settlement of the 1988 Everglades
litigation, and invites more federal court action; it also takes a position
that EPA has indicated (recently) is unacceptable.

Of course, while this move undercuts David Struhs good work, it does not
become real unless DEP and the whole ERC caves into it.  I sense this move
took place because the sugar folks have counted noses and now know that
other than Tropepe and Tjoflat, a majority of the ERC is lining up with
David's position.

The scary thing was that Mike Collins suggested that what ought to happen
is that the Legislature should take up this issue and amend the Everglades
Forever Act. This, of course, would trump David's position, and whatever
emerges from the ERC.  The SFWMD board, without a vote but by "consensus"
following Mike Collins' lead instructed their staff to go off to the
Legislature and attempt to tinker with the Everglades Forever Act.  

In the crazy session we know that we are facing on many issues, injecting
that into the mix is really an outrageous move. 

I think you ought to get the videotape of the meeting today and take a look
and have a listen to see how this went down.    

David Struhs has been doing a great job on the Everglades water quality
issue. This slick ploy by sugar and the SFWMD board can only be defeated if
you give your complete support to David, and let it be known that any
legislative mischief, prompted by SFWMD or otherwise, will simply meet a
veto. 

What is truly amazing is that SFWMD board members would be brazen enough to
try this in the open and reveal their willingness to go against David.

This bunch needs to be reeled in.

By the way, Henry did not have a part in this; he was helpless to deal with
an overpowering move by the SFWMD board skillfully set in motion by the
sugar lobbyists.

Berthy,

Thank you so much for your feedback. I added the very important self
determination confirmation principle. I will also try to confirm the
percent of individuals with cognitive disabilities who are unemployed, but
I believe your 96%  estimate is correct (unfortunately).  I have also added
some unemployment figures from the US Bureau of the Census 1997 survey
which indicated the unemployment rate of working age adults with
disabilities is 70 percent. Nationally the unemployment rate for all
working age adults is just over 5%. Only 26 percent of working age adults
with significant disabilities have a job or a business compared to 82
percent of those without significant disabilities. Among workers with
college degree, only 52 percent of those with severe disabilities report
labor market activity compared to 90 percent of those with no disability-a
gap of 38 percentage points. . The National Organization on Disability
(NOD) recently released , The State of the State Union 2002 for Americans
with Disabilities." The report details the findings of a comprehensive 2001
NOD Harris Poll, which surveyed Americans with disabilities on their
opinions of major life activities. The poll found that employment is the
largest gap area, with 32 percent of people with disabilities working full
or part time, compared to 81 percent of the rest of the population.

DOE and VR play a major role in our success to change history, especially
since federal law requires Medicaid to be the payor of last resort. The DS
waiver cannot afford to pick up the slack when other parties fail to comply
with their responsibilities. Ideally, we could cash out those revenues as
well and let self advocates decide how best utilize these public funds for
the purposes of their own employment planning.

I have attached the FCC proposal. I don't know why this didn't attach
correctly the first time, but let me know if you have trouble opening it.
This is a draft so please let me know if you have any suggestions or
concerns.

Shelly:

This is excellent!  I love it, and I hope that the Governor agrees with it!
A few minor comments, there are now 5 principles of self determination.
The last one is the principle of "confirmation"; people with disabilities
are involved in the advocacy and policy making of issues that affect their
lives. i.e. System redesign.  I think that the unemployment rate of people
with cognitive disabilities it's about 96%. Society has NO EXPECTATIONS of
what they can do, and unfortunately it starts with the school and it's
perpetuated by everything else.  The Governor and DCF needs to make sure
that FDOE change their paradigm. Special Education and VR is not helping
us.  If they do not change, most of your effort will be short lived.

If you sent something on the FCC recommendations, I want you to know that I
didn't receive it.

 Sincerely,
 Shelly Brantley, Director of
 Developmental Disabilities Program



 Common System Barriers for Individuals with Disabilities

 Current disability benefits, employment, and welfare programs interact in
 complex ways that often discourage beneficiaries from seeking employment
 and increased earnings. People with disabilities who wish to work often
 fear they will be forced to choose between giving up benefits and supports
 and their efforts to achieve independence through earnings. Individuals
 must navigate highly complex policies and procedures with the programs
 they
 currently access, and the programs they could potentially access, to
 determine a plan of action that leads to greater independence.

 People with disabilities, family members and advocates often find it
 difficult to make confident informed choices about benefit options and
 employment goals when faced with these complexities. Additionally, despite
 recent reform legislation, including the Ticket to Work and Work Incentive
 Act of 1999, there continues to be "incentive incompatibilities" that
 serve
 as barriers not only to the employment of individuals but also to the
 efforts of policy makers to improve the policies and remove the
 disincentives. For example, people with disabilities must demonstrate how
 they are unable to work because of their disability in order to be
 eligible
 for SSA benefits, but once determined eligible they are encouraged to use
 work incentives to achieve earnings (Social Security Handbook 2001).
 People
 with disabilities rightfully fear that working might demonstrate work
 potential that could threaten their continued eligibility.

 A major source of "incentive incompatibility" results from the fact that
 both eligibility and benefit levels for many government benefits are tied
 to earning levels. Programs such as housing/rent supplements, Supplemental
 Security Income (SSI), Medicaid, Medicare, Food Stamps, and TANF
 (Temporary
 Assistance to Needy Families) are characterized by benefits that either
 disappear or are reduced when a beneficiary's earnings rise. The
 reasonable
 fears people with disabilities have of losing disability-related benefits
 as a result of earnings, is a very real factor in maintaining their
 traditionally high unemployment levels.

 Almost 75% of people with disabilities remain unemployed in an economy
 that
 has experienced growth in employment opportunities for all workers.
 Current
 weakness in the economy is likely to drive the percentage of people with
 disabilities who are unemployed even higher. Of those people with
 disabilities who do work, the number of hours and employment opportunities
 are significantly constricted by program eligibility guidelines, income
 limitations, asset limitations, and other complex human service program
 interactions. The evidence that nearly all individuals with disabilities
 could work, if support and environmental changes are provided, has not led
 to the increases in employment that should have been achieved in the last
 decade. (Nerney, 1998).

 The US Bureau of the Census 1997 survey which indicated the unemployment
 rate of working age adults with disabilities is 70 percent. Nationally
 the unemployment rate for all working age adults is just over 5%. Only 26
 percent
 of working age adults with significant disabilities have a job or a
 business compared
 to 82 percent of those without significant disabilities. Among workers
 with college degree,
 only 52 percent of those with severe disabilities report labor market
 activity
 compared to 90 percent of those with no disability-a gap of 38 percentage
 points.

 The National Organization on Disability (NOD) recently released , The
 State of
 the State Union 2002 for Americans with Disabilities." The report details
 the findings
 of a comprehensive 2001 NOD Harris Poll, which surveyed Americans with
 disabilities on their opinions of major life activities. The poll found
 that employment
 is the largest gap area, with 32 percent of people with disabilities
 working full
  or part time, compared to 81 percent of the rest of the population.

 Self Determination

 The complex array of Medicaid and welfare policy regulations often work
 against achieving real self-determination for persons with disabilities, a
 principle central to the goal of inclusion, informed choice and economic
 and social sufficiency of people who have disabilities. Self-Determination
 addresses the limited freedom of choice and independent action often
 experienced by individuals with disabilities in the present health and
 human services system. Self determination is dependent on five basic
 principles: freedom to develop a personal life plan, authority to control
 a
 targeted sum of resources, support to obtain personal goals,
 responsibility
 for contributing to one's community and using public dollars
 wisely, and confirmation of the important leadership role that self
 advocates
 must play in a newly re-designed system and support for self advocacy
 movement. Principles of self-determination establish that people with
 disabilities are the planners and decision-makers in all daily living
 activities, such as working and taking financial control of service
 resources and personal income. Unfortunately, these principles will be
 hard
 to achieve without significant reforms to the current state and federally
 funded health and human services system.

 System Reform Recommendation

 We must directly address the systemic problems inherit to both the
 SSI/SSDI
 (Supplemental Security Disability Income) program and Medicaid which
 present significant barriers for individuals with disabilities seeking
 employment, typical housing opportunities and other ordinary freedoms
 associated with American citizenship. As Governor of the State of Florida,
 I would like to recommend piloting a "system of the future" which draws on
 our unique experience with consumer directed care and current efforts to
 expand choice, freedom and responsibility through the new Independence
 Plus
 Medicaid 1115 waiver authority. This recommendation will allow more State
 flexibility and authority over the current SSI/SSDI program as well as
 Medicaid to achieve a more cost-effective system of supports for
 individuals with disabilities without disincentives to work and barriers
 to
 independent living. (Please see Attachment A and B for a summary of
 Florida's Consumer Directed Care Waiver Project and Independence Plus
 Waiver Amendment Proposal.)

 Florida's Freedom Initiative: The System of the Future

 Purpose:

 §     The primary purpose of the proposed Florida Freedom Initiative is to
 demonstrate that when current ceilings on income and asset limitations are
 raised, and Medicaid funds can be used with greater flexibility,
 individuals with disabilities will overcome resistance to earning money
 privately, take their place as ordinary citizens and resolve housing and
 transportation problems more efficiently.

 §     The second purpose is to demonstrate more cost efficiency in the use
 of public funds.

 Objective:

 §     The overall objective in conducting this system reform effort is to
 demonstrate whether providing additional work incentives under the SSI
 program will remove potential and real barriers to work for recipients of
 SSI benefits based on ongoing developmental disability. Under this new
 waiver program we can test whether altering certain SSI program rules
 provides effective work incentives for SSI recipients and concurrent
 SSI/SSDI beneficiaries to attempt to work for the first time, return to
 work or increase their work hours and income.

 §     The second objective is to determine whether individuals who might
 not otherwise work and produce income can contribute to some of the costs
 of long term care as well as modestly increase their own earned income.

 Goals:

 §     Securing broad waiver authority under Medicaid and the Social
 Security Administration to allow those enrolled in the new Florida Freedom
 Initiative to increase their income and assets.

 §     Allow individuals to enroll in the new Florida Freedom Initiative to
 encourage creative approaches to housing, work and meaningful lives.

 §     Develop and implement an evaluation of the new Florida Freedom
 Initiative system to determine cost effectiveness of the increased
 flexibility and reduction of disincentives to work while increasing
 opportunities to control transportation and achieve affordable housing.

 §     Develop and implement a statewide training effort to maximize the
 effectiveness of using broad Medicaid and Social Security Administration
 waiver authority simultaneously.

 §     Design, develop and implement system reform for individuals with
 developmental disabilities that is cost effective, promotes the principles
 of self-determination and can be replicated across all disability
 populations.

 Necessary Waiver Authority to Implement Change:

 Florida has already participated in the most comprehensive demonstration
 of
 consumer directed care including children and adults with developmental
 disabilities, aged and disabled adults, and adults with Traumatic Brain
 Injury and Spinal Cord Injury. Broad Medicaid waiver authority and some
 waivers of SSA income and asset requirements already exist for consumer
 directed care and have been successfully tested. Florida can combine
 Medicaid 1115 waiver authority through our Independence Plus waiver
 proposal (submitted December 12, 2003) with additional waiver authority
 from the Social Security Administration to accent those issues most
 problematic for individuals with disabilities.

 §     Waive prohibition on room and board in order to make typical housing
 more available to individuals with developmental disabilities.

 §     Waive the prohibition on purchasing of transportation including
 those
 individuals who cannot drive but need to control the means of
 transportation to live meaningful lives.

 §     Waive any exclusion to pay employers directly for co-worker support,
 training costs, transportation or temporary wage supplementation.

 §     Waive all prohibitions on qualified Medicaid providers except where
 appropriate for normal criminal and other background checks. Allow
 individuals to contract with faith-based groups as well.

 §     Waive any real or perceived prohibitions on allowing individuals to
 capitalize very small micro enterprises up to $1500 annually.

 It is important to note broad Medicaid waiver authority already exists in
 Florida's current Consumer Directed Care Waiver and will be further
 expanded once we obtain federal approval for our new Independence Plus
 waiver amendment which includes the option to "cash out" certain Medicaid
 state plan services.  However, there is still a prohibition on room and
 board payments and the purchase of certain types of transportation under
 the current Medicaid authority.

 Conclusion: A Vision for the Future

 Florida's proposed strategy for system reform is consistent with the
 intent
 of inclusion and person directed support for individuals with
 disabilities.
 The mere use of publicly funded programs is not the point. The States in
 collaboration with the Federal government need a innovative, revolutionary
 and highly discretionary health and human service system to reduce
 bureaucracy, maximize public funds, natural supports and support real
 choice and empowerment for persons with disabilities. The founders of our
 nation conceived of a community of liberty, justice and equality. This
 nation was designed so that each citizen could contribute to the common
 good and therefore have a say in the destiny of the community. After more
 than 200 years, that vision is the corner stone of the community we are
 still in the process of creating.

Dear Gov. Bush,
 
   Like millions of Floridians, I enjoy buying a lotto ticket or two whenever the jackpot rises above $10-15 million.  I do so with complete understanding of the odds against my winning.  As you know, it take a minimum of three out of six numbers to win anything--usually about $5.  I propose creating more winners by making more tickets winners.  How about this:  one number on a ticket would pay $1; two numbers would pay $2; and three numbers would pay $3.  This idea would probably be revenue neutral but it would be psychologically positive.

U.S. jobs jumping ship 




Cheap offshore labor is not just for manufacturing any more -- is your job heading overseas, too?
March 13, 2003: 11:48 AM EST 
By Mark Gongloff <mailto:mark.gongloff@turner.com> , CNN/Money Staff Writer







NEW YORK (CNN/Money) - As painful as February's big job cuts were, they're even more painful since many of those jobs are never coming back as U.S. employers in a wide range of industries move more and more jobs overseas. 

That's old news for manufacturers, who have been cutting jobs and moving them offshore for decades, but it's a trend that's also starting to gather steam in a number of service industries, especially information technology, formerly one of America's best-paying industries. 

 "By 2004, more than 80 percent of U.S. executive boardrooms will have discussed offshore sourcing, and more than 40 percent of U.S. enterprises will have completed some type of pilot or will be sourcing IT (information technology) services," Gartner <http://cgi.cnnfn.com/mgi/mgi_search?QUERY=IT>  Inc. (IT <http://gw.cnnfn.com/search/GW?symbol=IT> : Research <http://cnnfn.multexinvestor.com/TickerSearch.asp?ticker=IT> , Estimates <http://cgi.cnnfn.com/firstcall/fc?ticker=IT> ), a technology consulting firm, said in a study late last year. 

U.S. businesses, battered by a three-year bear market in stocks and an economy that can't seem to find its footing, are developing a taste for super-cheap overseas labor in developing countries, where workers are increasingly better-trained, especially if they've spent significant time working in the United States on temporary visas. 

A recent survey of 145 U.S. companies by consultant Forrester Research found that 88 percent of the firms that look overseas for services claimed to get better value for their money offshore than from U.S. providers, while 71 percent said offshore workers did better quality work. 

That's news that can't stay quiet for long, and companies <http://money.cnn.com/2003/03/13/news/economy/jobs_offshore/index.htm#companies#companies>  like Microsoft <http://cgi.cnnfn.com/mgi/mgi_search?QUERY=MSFT>  (MSFT <http://gw.cnnfn.com/search/GW?symbol=MSFT> : Research <http://cnnfn.multexinvestor.com/TickerSearch.asp?ticker=MSFT> , Estimates <http://cgi.cnnfn.com/firstcall/fc?ticker=MSFT> ), Intel <http://cgi.cnnfn.com/mgi/mgi_search?QUERY=INTC>  (INTC <http://gw.cnnfn.com/search/GW?symbol=INTC> : Research <http://cnnfn.multexinvestor.com/TickerSearch.asp?ticker=INTC> , Estimates <http://cgi.cnnfn.com/firstcall/fc?ticker=INTC> ) and CNN/Money parent company AOL Time Warner <http://cgi.cnnfn.com/mgi/mgi_search?QUERY=AOL>  (AOL <http://gw.cnnfn.com/search/GW?symbol=AOL> : Research <http://cnnfn.multexinvestor.com/TickerSearch.asp?ticker=AOL> , Estimates <http://cgi.cnnfn.com/firstcall/fc?ticker=AOL> ) already are responding. 

"Over the next 15 years, 3.3 million U.S. service industry jobs and $136 billion in wages will move offshore to countries like India, Russia, China and the Philippines," Forrester analyst John McCarthy predicted in a report last year. "The IT industry will lead the initial overseas exodus." 

What spending slump?

While tech spending by U.S. businesses has been underwater since the tech bubble of the late 1990s popped in 2000, countries such as India, China, Ireland, Israel and the Philippines all are experiencing a boom in exporting IT services. 

"Analysts who predicted India's software exports to the United States would drop on account of shrinking IT spending in that country were surprised to see exports actually rise to this region," the National Association of Software and Services Company, an IT industry association in India, said recently. 



“ I bought my first house in 1999 -- that was a very big deal for me -- and now I have to sell it, only because they won't hire Americans. It's devastating. ” 
Donna Bradley, 
Unemployed IT specialist in Mesa, Ariz. 

NASSCOM predicts that the Indian "business process outsourcing" industry -- a narrow category that includes customer-support call centers -- will export $21 billion to $24 billion worth of services by 2008 and employ more than 1.1 million Indian workers. 

Those workers -- in one narrow segment of the outsourcing industry in just one country -- would replace about 1 million U.S. workers, according to consulting firm Gartner. 

"This is not counting the offshore services provided by other countries such as the Philippines, Ireland and Jamaica, or the other IT services that are likely to [use] offshore resources," a Gartner study said. "The scale of job migration potential is quite significant." 

To be sure, these countries all compete with each other for business -- in its 2002 annual report, Indian outsourcing firm Wipro Ltd. <http://cgi.cnnfn.com/mgi/mgi_search?QUERY=WIT>  (WIT <http://gw.cnnfn.com/search/GW?symbol=WIT> : Research <http://cnnfn.multexinvestor.com/TickerSearch.asp?ticker=WIT> , Estimates <http://cgi.cnnfn.com/firstcall/fc?ticker=WIT> ) warned "wage increases in India may prevent us from sustaining [our] competitive advantage and may" hurt profits -- but they all provide cheaper labor than the United States. 

The Contact Center Association of the Philippines, an industry group for suppliers of customer support call centers, boasts that Filipino workers' salaries are just a quarter to a fifth of those in the United States, with programmers earning $250 to $700 a month, compared with $1,600 to $3,600 in the U.S., and project managers making $700 to $1,150 a month, compared with $3,600 to $7,100. 

Irresistibly lured by such rock-bottom costs, a wide array of companies -- including Microsoft, Intel, Citigroup <http://cgi.cnnfn.com/mgi/mgi_search?QUERY=C>  (C <http://gw.cnnfn.com/search/GW?symbol=C> : Research <http://cnnfn.multexinvestor.com/TickerSearch.asp?ticker=C> , Estimates <http://cgi.cnnfn.com/firstcall/fc?ticker=C> ), Hewlett-Packard <http://cgi.cnnfn.com/mgi/mgi_search?QUERY=HPQ>  (HPQ <http://gw.cnnfn.com/search/GW?symbol=HPQ> : Research <http://cnnfn.multexinvestor.com/TickerSearch.asp?ticker=HPQ> , Estimates <http://cgi.cnnfn.com/firstcall/fc?ticker=HPQ> ), Procter  <http://cgi.cnnfn.com/mgi/mgi_search?QUERY=PG> & Gamble (PG <http://gw.cnnfn.com/search/GW?symbol=PG> : Research <http://cnnfn.multexinvestor.com/TickerSearch.asp?ticker=PG> , Estimates <http://cgi.cnnfn.com/firstcall/fc?ticker=PG> ), AT <http://cgi.cnnfn.com/mgi/mgi_search?QUERY=T> &T (T <http://gw.cnnfn.com/search/GW?symbol=T> : Research <http://cnnfn.multexinvestor.com/TickerSearch.asp?ticker=T> , Estimates <http://cgi.cnnfn.com/firstcall/fc?ticker=T> ) and AIG <http://cgi.cnnfn.com/mgi/mgi_search?QUERY=AIG>  (AIG <http://gw.cnnfn.com/search/GW?symbol=AIG> : Research <http://cnnfn.multexinvestor.com/TickerSearch.asp?ticker=AIG> , Estimates <http://cgi.cnnfn.com/firstcall/fc?ticker=AIG> ) -- all have turned to Filipino companies for call center and other IT services. 

In one call center in Pampanga province, 850 Filipinos answer customer service calls for Internet service provider America Online, a member of the AOL Time Warner family. 

Broader impact still distant

Most economists believe the offshore outsourcing trend is not substantial enough yet to have a big impact on the broader U.S. economy -- imports of business services account for less than 1/20 of 1 percent of gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the nation's economy. 

But economists are starting to take note of the trend. 

"If it's not a big story yet, it could become one," said Josh Bivens, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington think tank that focuses on labor issues. 

 At the least, it's not making the weak job market in the United States any better. Employers cut 321,000 jobs in February, bringing employment outside the farm sector down to 109.2 million, the Labor Department reported last week, ringing alarm bells about the health of the U.S. economy. 

Nearly 8.5 million people are unemployed, which gives workers who do have jobs less leverage when asking for a raise; as a result, wage and salary growth has begun to slow, and that in turn is threatening consumer spending, which fuels more than two-thirds of the economy. 

IT workers feel the pain

In few areas has the competition for jobs had a bigger impact on wage growth than in the IT industry. In the 1990s, it seemed all one had to do to buy a ticket to Easy Street was learn a programming language or how to manage corporate computer networks. 

Those good old days are long gone, with unemployment is rising, IT spending in a deep slump and software services moving offshore. 

What's more, some IT professionals and immigrant groups complain that U.S. employers manipulate the H-1B visa system, which allows college-educated people from overseas to work in the United States for up to six years. They're supposed to be paid a "prevailing wage," but many employers pay them as little as possible. With such cheap labor available right here in the United States, there's even less reason for IT wages to rise. 


 <http://money.cnn.com/news/economy/>  

"I talked about salary with a company last week, and they were paying between $30 and $35 an hour," said Donna Bradley, an IT specialist in Mesa, Ariz., who's been out of work since August 2002. "In August I was making $45 an hour." 

It didn't matter; Bradley, 49, didn't get the job and is selling her house and moving to Maryland to live with her daughter while she continues to look for work. 

"The irony is that I was a single mother, and I raised five kids by myself and put myself through school," Bradley said. "I bought my first house in 1999 -- that was a very big deal for me -- and now I have to sell it, only because they won't hire Americans. It's devastating." 

Still, Bradley's experience is not yet the norm in this country. Many firms have found that there are difficulties -- including the risk of inspiring anger among their U.S. workers -- in moving white-collar jobs offshore. For that reason, most U.S. companies are still just dipping their toes in the water. 

"We saw this in manufacturing -- firms started off slow and stayed close to home," said labor economist Heather Boushey of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, another Washington think tank. "But then it hit a 'moment,' and many more firms started doing it because it became impossible to compete without workers overseas. 

"We're not there yet in the non-manufacturing sector, by any stretch of the imagination," she said.   <http://money.cnn.com/2003/03/13/news/economy/jobs_offshore/index.htm#TOP#TOP>

RE: Inauguration and Ribbon-cutting Ceremony for the ABiCC World Business Week 2003

Dear Governor,

I would here like to invite you to the Ribbon-Cutting Ceremony, with the International Wine, Liquor and Food Tasting, for the ABiCC World Business Week 2003 at the Inter-Continental Hotel in downtown Miami on Monday, March 17 at 6:30 PM. This is now our 3rd world business week, and this year, the ceremony is sponsored by the Government of Puerto Rico.

During the World Business Week, there will be a whole range of activities organized by our different bi-national chambers of commerce, such as seminars, conferences, exhibitions, luncheons, cocktails and dinners. The international business community in Florida will be gathering at these various events throughout the week. This community represented by 40 bi-national chambers of commerce will unite during these difficult times, to promote international trade as well as Miami and Florida as the ideal location for business and for the future Secretariat of the FTAA. We can show the world that even during times of conflict, the international business community can get together and stimulate trade and business.

Hoping to count with your presence as our Guest of Honor at our Ribbon-Cutting ceremony on March 17 at 6.30PM. I send you my best regards.

Yours sincerely,

I think the FCAT and other standardized testing is very necessary to measure
how hard students have worked all year and true intellectual growth.
Sometimes, outside factors have too much influence on grades.  Family or
community social status, donations from certain people to schools, or just
in general constant complaining can sometimes cause grade inflation.  Any
college professor knows now, the GPA and what a student really can do is
more than likely not in line.  I teach, and my two gifted daughters and I
live in
a little shack in Ocala and don't have much influence (or much of anything
else).   My kids love testing weeks and the fact that colleges still look at
SAT scores.  Although they both have good grades, if scholarship
opportunities were based on grades alone, they may have missed out.
Standardized tests such as the SAT, however, will help one of my daughters
so far get her Bright Futures Scholarship, because colleges know that is the
real proof of the pudding.  
Both of my daughters love the FCAT and other chances for standardized
testing.  They know it is their chance to shine! It TRULY is out chance at 
equal opportunity and the American Dream, which to me is what public
education is all about.  Debbie Rosetti, Art Teacher (and past K-5
Elem.teacher)  P.S.  Keep your chin up about what people say about FCAT, and
remember people in my situation.  We don't drive large expensive SUV's, or
walk around the schools yielding big material donations, but we do have kids
who behave, try, dream, love learning, are truly smart, etc., etc.  FCAT
counts them.

Subject: Mentoring concerns


I would mention this to you Friday morning, but I will not be here 
when you arrive.
Today my mentoring coordinator informed me that she was collecting 
names of mentors and mentees to turn in to
the county for some kind of research being conducted by a new 
mentoring department out of DOE.  I called the county volunteer 
coordinator with questions.  I probably have most information 
confused but.........

My questions and concerns center around this:  Many students (and 
their parents) may not wish their names to be listed as needing 
mentoring.  To many it is positive.  To others it is something they 
are unsure of .  We don't publicize their names unnecessarily. 
Parents must be asked one by one if we decide to use any publicity at 
all.  Even pictures taken for our school business do not show faces 
of students. I am concerned about sending out of the school to the 
county and state a list of those students .   Test scores, grades for 
these singled-out students?

I understood when I asked questions that the goal is to determine the 
worth of the mentoring program statewide.  I am assuming that the one 
given this task will be able to recognize that mentoring is only a 
part of any success or failure.  As you know, I am such an advocate 
of mentoring.  But, there are hundreds of variables in any student's 
success.

Again, I trust that this has all been determined to be most positive. 
However, when I spoke with the county volunteer coordinator and 
expressed my concerns about listing students names, she recognized 
that this was a process that needed to be questioned.

I won't be here for about 4 days.  No hurry in anything other than 
planting my questions in your mind. Thanks for listening. Donna

   FROM THE DESK OF JON B. RAWLSON	  <http://www.pharmerica.com/> PharMerica	
    www.pharmerica.com <http://www.pharmerica.com/> 	

Jeb - 

I read your comments this morning which you gave before the Energy & Commerce Subcommittee on Health last week and thought they were right on! I have a few items to offer for your consideration as you move forward on the NGA/RGA task force:

*	Federal resources for those "dually eligible" patients - should be significantly increased and would certainly help provide some relief to the states. I was in a small meeting last week with Doug Badger - who as you know serves in the President's Economic Policy shop - and he agreed that this is an area of concern and one where the Administration believes they help. 

*	

	You recognized the strain on current providers to the Medicaid program. You just can't over emphasize that point. We - my company - and our small part of the pharmacy industry serve just long term care - patients/residents of nursing homes. We have fixed costs which are much higher than retail pharmacy and yet are reimbursed by the same method. The squeeze we are feeling due to the state's fiscal pressures is significant. We serve a disproportionably higher percentage of that population (over 60%) and so we have no where to go. We are heavily regulated - at the state and federal levels - and states like MA and CA are adding to that burden, which as you know, has a significant cost factor. We are in the single digit profit margin and the future doesn't look that good. Further straining the providers could lead to significant change in the services for that population who are both elderly and fragile. 
*	

	Another consideration for Florida - but not necessarily the case for other states is that you have achieved most of the savings available in the prescription drug area through the innovative approaches taken over the last 2 years. There really isn't much left in that area and additional pressures can only compromise the services to the patient population we serve.

Jeb - as you move forward in the dialogue with the Task Force, I would appreciate the opportunity to offer suggestions and ideas on other reforms within Medicaid. If you have any thoughts on how we could help in this process, please be sure to let me know. Also, I think you know that I am on the JMI Board - if JMI could help in any way - we would be pleased to do so. 
 
Thanks.
Jon

Subject: I-75 Interchange mistake

Dear Governor:
 
 
I am writing to request more thought and care be addressed to a proposed interchange with I-75 in Sarasota county.  This proposal has caused much controversy here on a local and regional level.
 
There is a nice pocket of beauty and tranquility in Sarasota County called Palmer Ranch, much of which is owned by Hugh Culverhouse, Jr.   Palmer Ranch is a major reason Sarasota County ranks as one of the most desirable counties in the state, and a reason Sarasota is a major draw for Florida in general.  
 
The proposed interchange plows right through the heart of Palmer Ranch and disturbs a beautiful balance of people and environment.  There is over a 90% disapproval rating of this project by the affected communities as evidenced by a petition against such disrruptions.  Furthermore, it takes 4 minutes to access the interstate through Clark road by any member of the Palmer Ranch.
 
It is not needed.  Surely, in such uncertain times, $23 million dollars (conservatively estimated), can be better used in other parts of the state than this "luxury" of another I-&5 access in Sarasota County.
 
The stated arguments for such an interchange are that we need another arterial to I-75 in Sarasota to relieve pressure from Clark Road and Hurricane evacuation, and that it was in the masterplan approved in 1984.
 
Well, as far as traffic relief of Clark road, especially in light of Hurricane threat, the statistics don't support that.  Clark road is a six lane road not nearing capacity and Hurricane season is in the off season.  This town nearly shrinks in half when the people go home.
 
The masterplan was apporved by commissioners long since gone when there were no residents here.  A plan is never set in stone and always has to take into account contingencies.  You have to navigate as you go.  The plan was approved under very different conditions by people of long ago.  All plans are subject to modification.
 
In some small way, Palmer Ranch does help keep all Florida distinctive.  A new interchange blazing right through the middle of it is needed; at the bare minimum with such turbulent times in the economy the timing seems way off on this.
 
Please do all you can to stop this project.  Some parts of Florida need to be preserved.  I invite you to come for a visit to see for yourself the wonderful planning in harmonizing nature and living and you will understand.
 
Your kind servant,
 
Scott Chandler

Governor,
 
It was great chatting with you briefly today before our presentations at the City Cares National Conference Opening Plenary here in Miami.    
 
As requested, I am following-up on having my art hang in your office.  I'd like to get a sense from you as to what would make most sense.  I can have some of my existing pieces exhibited and loaned for the remainder of your term, or I can create a Florida-specific painting or mural to hang permanently. 
 
Actually, it would be cool to create a mural much like the one on the stage today, where we would collage messages on the background.  The mural could be entitled "My Florida," capturing the state-wide stories and voices about Floridians love most about their state.  
 
Please let me know what you think, and how to proceed.
 
Thanks,
Xavier

like to recommend him for this appointment, since he is a highly qualified
candidate and would be a superior judge.  He is also a good person, and

Importance: High


Governor Bush,

Good morning!  Believe it, it is almost that time of the year again.  Time
for the Family Cafe conference and your Annual Summit on Disabilities!  Can
you believe that it has been 5 years?  What a great success it has brought
to families and this state.  Other states are looking to duplicate the
efforts...wanting to host similar events.  When they ask me how it gets
done, and I respond that we in Florida happen to have an administration that
cares and supports its constituency.  That support begins with you.
Personally we all owe you, not only our appreciation and loyalty for what
you have accomplished...but our smiles for the services our loved ones can
now access.

For this year's conference, we are able to increase the support for families
for this year's event.  We currently have over 4500 registered....and more
and more are adding their names to the list everyday.

Just to keep you up to date on events at the conference prior to your
summit.  We have a reception scheduled form 4:30 p.m. - 5:30 p.m. on that
Friday evening, May 30, 2003.  At 5:30 p.m., we have a speaker scheduled Dr.
Terry Lyles, who not only has holds a Ph.D. in psychology and is recognized
as a national/international educator, author and speaker...but is a father
to an 18 year son who has cerebral palsy.  Dr. Lyles is also a Floridian,
who resides in West Palm Beach with his family  Depending on the climate he
will speak on public safety (the fear of uncertainty for the future due to
9/11) or navigating life storms (a life balance opportunity).  Sounds
exciting...doesn't it!

After Dr. Lyles presentation, we will again have children (from the local
Orlando UCP) entertaining the entire forum until you are ready to begin your
Summit.  I hope that this arrangement works with your schedule or please let
me know of any opportunities or desired changes.

Governor, by the end of this month the Family Cafe program will need a
letter signed by you for the front page of the conference program.  If you
prefer to just let me talk with someone else for this issue, just pass along
a name.  I am sorry to hear Liz Hirst left.. I wish her well.  She was such
a good resource for us.

Just one more...we requested the Department Secretaries have an open forum
with the attendees during a various break out sessions on Saturday, and I am
happy to report that all were delighted to accommodate.  This really
enforces the access to policy leaders.  Families are going to so pleased.
In fact, this was a major request on the evaluations of years' past by the
attendees.  I thank them all for their commitment towards true service.
Fantastic!

Please also extend all invitations to your staff for attendance at the 5th
Annual Family Cafe Conference.  I do hope that maybe the Lt. Governor Toni
Jennings will also like to attend.  An event that happens in her "old"
backyard.  She has also been such a supporter for families with the Toni
Jennings Institute for Excellence at UCF, and with Workforce and her years
of leadership in the legislature.

Smiles,

Dear Governor Bush:

This letter is sent to express our unreserved support for Clay Simmons whose
name is before you as a prospective circuit court judge for the Eighteenth
Judicial Circuit.
For many years we have known Clay and his work as an attorney.  He knows the
law--especially the important and difficult areas of property and commercial
law.  Clay is also a good man whose decisions will emanate from proper
values and ethics.

We have lived our whole lives in the Eighteenth Circuit, and have our
business here as well.  Traditionally, the Eighteenth Circuit has been a
bench known for enforcing contracts and for upholding property rights.  We
believe Clay Simmons will carry on
this circuit's tradition of hard work and intelligent jurisprudence.

We whole-heartedly and respectfully endorse Clay and hope that you choose
him to be our next circuit court judge.

Legal morass destroying health care 

By Dr. Steven Podnos Guest Columnist 




I respect our system of law. I understand the desire of some to protect the rights of individuals to sue health-care providers for a perceived or real episode of medical malpractice. However, this supposed right is destroying the best system of medical care in the world. 


We are all aware of the explosion of litigation in our country during the last several decades. Recent news media articles have said there is no medical malpractice crisis, and that the pace of legal attacks on physicians is stable. This is untrue and comes from an abuse of statistics. 


The market speaks the truth, as the number of insurers even willing to offer malpractice coverage to physicians has dropped at least 80 percent in the last two years. 


These companies can charge almost whatever they want. They will not function in a market that costs them money and exposes them to an uncertain financial future. 


If there were no crisis, companies would be rushing in to make the money available by selling such insurance for the "phantom crisis." Instead, I just signed a policy agreement charging me four times the amount I paid for coverage just two years ago. 


I work a full month of the year just to pay this insurance premium. Then I start working on my increasing practice overhead. 


Besides the increasing financial drain, the current malpractice system is corroding the physician-patient relationship. Already strained by the demands of the managed-care system, the threat of legal attack is placing physicians and patients in an adversarial position. 


Every physician I know thinks about their liability for a malpractice action daily. Even a threatened lawsuit brings the anguish of increased insurance premiums and a scramble even to find coverage. 


We all have heard dozens of stories from our peers about suits initiated due to bad outcomes, and not due to any malpractice. Subsequently, we fear providing risky but perhaps necessary therapy. 


In 1990, I was the target of a lawsuit alleging that I had not done everything possible to save the life of a woman with an illness that carried an approximately 50 percent chance of death regardless of treatment. The case dragged on for six very long years. 


During this time, I obtained an entire education on the cynicism and avarice of the plaintiff's bar. I saw the reason I was guilty change several times, and saw that experts were available for hire to testify on almost any basis, regardless of science or truth. 


I was told by my defense attorneys that "it was all a game of positioning" and that "whoever lined up the most believable experts" would win. After six years of sleepless nights and second-guessing myself, the insurance company settled out of court, as was their legal right. 


I find myself much less interested in caring for such patients now, and see my fellow physicians dropping coverage for "risky" cases. I see that they too have lost the enthusiasm for a patient with a challenging or confusing illness. The downside has gotten too large. I believe that every physician wishes to provide concerned and competent medical care. 


Our malpractice system is making this impossible. It is a real and rapidly worsening problem. We may retain our "rights" to sue physicians, or we may have access to high quality doctors. We cannot have both, and must choose.

It is my understanding the release of the Just for the Kids best practices
went well. Your Lt Gov attended in your place and I was told it got good
coverage. Another project we are working on is the Eli Broad prize for the
best urban school district in the country. The Foundation hired us last year
at the suggestion of the White House to run the selection process. The
initial winner selected by a jury of prominent leaders across the country
was the Houston Independent School District. In addition there were 4 other
finalists. The 5 districts received a total of $1,000,000 in scholarships
for their students. The selection process is stringent and based upon
academic results and site visits. I have been asked to ask you to serve as a
juror this year. The other jurors will include Gov Hunt, Jack Welch, Dick
Riley, Henry Cisneros, Richard Parsons (CEO of Time Warner), Phil Condit
(CEO of Boeing), Gov Patton and several others. The jurors meet one time to
review our work and pick the winner. Last but not least I would still be
happy to come meet with some Florida foundations regarding the Advanced
Placement program if that is something you would like me to do.

Yes, I have advocated assistive technology  for disabled students and we have been successful in the appropriation process. yes, I am an advocate of using web based assistance for the disabled for the FCAT. Yes, I am hopeful eventually, we will have a web based FCAT for all students with all of the benefits that this can bring to the students of our states. This will require being convinced that the technology has advanced concerning  artificial intellingence to match the current system of human graders and that there is enough access to computers to make this new way of doing things a reality. The end result is that the test can be given later in the year and the results can be returned much, much quicker. There is much to work out to achieve this vision and the Department of Education is working to make the vision reality. I hpe this helps.

Gov. Bush, 

I'm doing a story about Michael Phillips, the young Tampa men who has Werdnig-Hoffman's disease and is reclined on his back at all times. I understand he came and gave you a demonstration of the Vantage Learning web assessment program in December. I have seen Michael work his way around  the computer and his abilities are truly amazing. 

I was wondering if you would give me a description of Michael's demonstration, including what you thought about it. 

I understand from him and his mother, Karen Clay, that you ordered a pilot project involving handicapped children using the web assessment grading of FCAT tests. Could you expand on what you have asked the Department of Education to do at this juncture and what your hopes are? 

 Also, I understand that you had discussions about bringing this web assessment on the FCAT to all children eventually.  Is this something you are considering and what are the pros and or cons of this? What do you think about the artificial intelligence grading of open-ended questions? 

Thank you in advance for taking the time to address these issues. I look forward to hearing from you. 

Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Bush- In addition to our concern for what's going on with Iraq, we 
are now facing even more harassment from our "association management" - On 
march 6 they invited to a meeting to change the bylaws because they want us 
the homeowners to accept that anyone not living in the community be part of 
the board and some other discriminating things- when Ms Taimira tried to 
protest she was told that she could not talk because she was not paying her 
dues by the manager of the association-
The freedom of speech is part of our American Constitution - Not even the 
goverment tells its people that if they don't pay taxes, they loose that 
right-so why this people do so- This community was built for low income 
families, but we are HARD WORKING people minding our business and trying to 
live day by day-  Our community is been used for personal gain- The more we 
research, the more we come out we stuff that really make us angry- monies 
have been assing for the betterment of the community that has never reach 
the community and so on- The majority of the residents cannot afford to 
move.  Some like my father in law, is looking forward to pay off the house 
and retire- We need help NOW-
We need legal assistance-
Thank you for your time-  Miryam Ruiz

Jeb:

It was such a pleasure to meet with you yesterday.  I like the Miami
office MUCH better than the Tallahassee one.  It's less intimidating,
and informal which made me feel more conformable.

I hope that with Shelly's advise you are able to include the FCC in your
CAFE line item.  The FCC are a great POTENTIAL resource that needs to
get the needed support to be able to move the system forward in the
right direction.  Please, make sure to read the written information that
I gave you on the subject.  Don't forget to ask Julie Shaw for a copy of
the state Medicaid report.  I have not been able to get a copy as it's
apparently being rewritten.

On your testimony on the Medicaid reform.  I hope that the disability
community doesn't get upset with you. Based on the Principles of Self
Determination and consumer directed SUPPORTS, some of the information
that I gathered is a follow:

1. There is a clear institutional bias in Medicaid

2. Community is the preferred way of living for the vast majority of all
individuals with disabilities including those who are aging.

3. Traditionally, individuals with disabilities have had to surrender
their basic freedoms in order to secure support under the Medicaid
program.

4. Today, there is a growing movement for "self-determination" or
consumer directed supports.

5. We have to find a way to address the growing population of
individuals who need Medicaid funding for supports and become much more
cost effective.

6. States do not know what to do. The initial reaction is to seize
flexibility from the Federal Government (not a bad thing by itself) and
then ration Medicaid. The alternative is to design a new system based on
real freedom and real value--i.e.. cost effectiveness.  

The time has come to fundamentally change the Medicaid law and
regulations as well as the law and regulations surrounding SSI/SSDI
under Social Security.  Medicaid is irretrievably broken.    The new
system of the future (TOM NERNEY) needs to be:

1. more cost effective

2. founded on real choice and self-determination

3. much more flexible than the present system. (see "The System of the
Future")

4. Encourage work not discourage it like the present system does.

I will try to gather more information, and sent to you by the end of the
day.  Tu eres "LA VOZ".  Que Dios te bendiga, te ilumine, y te de
sabiduria.

Gracias por todo.

RE: Inauguration and Ribbon-cutting Ceremony for the ABiCC World Business Week 2003

Dear Governor,

I would here like to invite you to the Ribbon-Cutting Ceremony, with the International Wine, Liquor and Food Tasting, for the ABiCC World Business Week 2003 at the Inter-Continental Hotel in downtown Miami on Monday, March 17 at 6:30 PM. This is now our 3rd world business week, and this year, the ceremony is sponsored by the Government of Puerto Rico.

During the World Business Week, there will be a whole range of activities organized by our different bi-national chambers of commerce, such as seminars, conferences, exhibitions, luncheons, cocktails and dinners. The international business community in Florida will be gathering at these various events throughout the week. This community represented by 40 bi-national chambers of commerce will unite during these difficult times, to promote international trade as well as Miami and Florida as the ideal location for business and for the future Secretariat of the FTAA. We can show the world that even during times of conflict, the international business community can get together and stimulate trade and business.

Hoping to count with your presence as our Guest of Honor at our Ribbon-Cutting ceremony on March 17 at 6.30PM. I send you my best regards.

Yours sincerely,

Lita Haeger

Subject:	Petition for Declaratory Statement - Florida Administrative Procedures Act

Dear Mr. York,
 
Section 120.565 F.S. states the following:
 
120.565  Declaratory statement by agencies.-- 
(1)  Any substantially affected person may seek a declaratory statement regarding an agency's opinion as to the applicability of a statutory provision, or of any rule or order of the agency, as it applies to the petitioner's particular set of circumstances. 
(2)  The petition seeking a declaratory statement shall state with particularity the petitioner's set of circumstances and shall specify the statutory provision, rule, or order that the petitioner believes may apply to the set of circumstances. 
(3)  The agency shall give notice of the filing of each petition in the next available issue of the Florida Administrative Weekly and transmit copies of each petition to the committee. The agency shall issue a declaratory statement or deny the petition within 90 days after the filing of the petition. The declaratory statement or denial of the petition shall be noticed in the next available issue of the Florida Administrative Weekly. Agency disposition of petitions shall be final agency action. 
History.--s. 6, ch. 75-191; s. 7, ch. 76-131; s. 5, ch. 78-425; s. 5, ch. 79-299; s. 760, ch. 95-147; s. 17, ch. 96-159. 
 
 
First, do you agree that the Florida Administrative Procedures Act applies to the Department of State and the Division of Elections?
 
Second, do you agree that a citizen has a right to a declaratory statement of the application of Section 111.012 or Chapter 119, F.S., to his or her particular set of circumstances?
 
I am sure you will agree to both of the above.  Therefore, can the Department of State and Division of Elections treat my inquiries thus far as a petition for declaratory statement and will your agency respond to my request thus far?
 
Or, is it your position that I would have to file a new petition to address the Section 111.012 issues?
 
The question before the Department and the Division is squarely (1) whether or not if I hold a “roast” for a state public officer, as described in my earlier petition correspondence, is Section 111.012 applicable to the requirement to file a notice of intent and financial report pursuant to Section 111.012, and (2) are others who are persons in charge of holding a “roast” for an elected public officer responsible for filing the notices and reports under 111.012 where I, and any citizen, have a right to know where the money in those affairs is coming from and going to under rights of access to public records reserved to us as citizens under the Florida Constitution and Chapter 119, the Florida public records law?
 
Also, the administrative procedures act would also apply to Supervisors of Election, would it not?  By copy of this request to Mark Anderson in Bay County I am also asking the he respond to this email under the same questions posed except as related to elected county officers under his filing and reporting retention requirements under F.S. 111.012.
 
Please respond as soon as possible as to whether you will treat my prior request as a petition for declaratory statement or if I have to file a formal petition with the Division and/or Department.  If so, please advise to whom the petition should be addressed and why my filings thus far cannot be treated as a petition.  The same questions are posed to Mr. Anderson as Supervisor of Elections.  It appears that Ms. Jones in Escambia County was certainly acting proper in accordance with the law by providing me with a declaratory statement.
 
Thanks for you help.

Dear Governor Bush:

Did someone make you my kid brother or what?  I'm always going to you with more problems.  Sorry.  Of course I couldn't ask for a better brother if I were to have one.

Have a couple at church, they have the guitar choir with another lady.  Anyhow, this past summer they were on vacation in Virginia and the wife became ill, severely and was hospitalized with multiple blood clots in both lungs.  During that hospitalization, they found a heart condition and cancer in the cervix.  

The hospital in Virginia sent for medicaid papers from here and got the process started for her to get medical aid.

Tonight I hear, that medicaid has told them to get divorced, after 44 years and she will get complete medical coverage.  Do we have to end a marriage of 44 years for medical benefits?  She broke down crying and went to our parish priest and asked him if she needs to get divorced.  He said no.

She has to meet $945.00 a month in medical expenses or her coverage stops.  If she is one penny shy she has no coverage for the next month.  She was shy last month or this month, not sure which.  He had to take his credit card to the pharmacy just so she can get her heart medication.  Next month she's back in the hospital in Tampa for another evaluation and has to get another one week stay in the hospital for slow drip chemo.  They make $1,308.00 a month.  Years ago, they took in their one grandson who is  turning 18 in June.  His benefits of $345. will stop when he turns 18 unless he's still in school.  They are hoping he fails his senior year so they can still get at least that amount of money in the house.  She's 63 years old and he's older, don't know by how much.

The names are Jan and Joe Most, 772-461-8512.  I don't know what you can do to help them. Please don't send that man to e mail me again. The answer's he's given twice have been worthless.  And I don't mean Jerry Regier.   I just don't remember the man's name, and I don't save my e mail or print it out.  

If there is anything you can do to help this couple, it's so unfortunate that our senior citizen's have to suffer like this.  I'm not far behind them at 56, so we need to be making some serious changes here.

Subject: Charter Schools


Governor Bush,
 
Many of us in the charter community have been working on what we discussed with you last year about how we can close the gap between charters and traditional public schools, both academically and financially. Attached is a draft proposal that will be coming before the Legislature on behalf of the coalition members named, plus several other groups soon to join. Al Cardenas will be representing us all, along with all of our individual lobbyists pitching in. Unfortunately, we've learned that we need high powered juice just to be heard in Tallahassee.  Just for the record, I support the DOE's bill and new accountability and funding authority being proposed. Our suggestions, a) support your efforts, b) ties performance to capital, c) protects existing bank/bond debt obligations, and d) provides the state with a long-term funding solution at no cost. 
 
We recognize that continued growth in capital outlay is not possible and alternate forms of funding must be sought. Besides the capital outlay ideas we've included, I've been working with a group of school finance experts across the state, including DOE and FSU, to identify why there's such a huge disparity in non-capital per pupil spending between districts and charters. For example, in Broward County, we're receiving approximately $1,800 less per student than the district, apparently due to federal funds and grants that they do not distribute to charters. This on top of the 5% fee has created a financial scenario where increasing class size is our only alternative to shutting down schools. The fact is we receive 50% of the funding that districts do when including federal funds, 2 mill and PECO, yet we educate the same public school students and provide the same, and often times better, services. This is a disparity that must be addressed and can be at no cost to the state by either requiring districts to distribute equally all their funds (assuming student qualification) or by funding us through a separate vehicle where we aren't the chicken asking the fox for our eggs back! Thanks Jeb for your support and I hope you and you're family are doing well. 
 
Jon Hage
 
PS: I hear you'll be visiting one of our schools on Monday and I hope to drop by briefly to say hi. I think you will be impressed with what we can do if we can work off of a somewhat level playing field and a road map that doesn't change every year.

HON. JEB BUSH, FLORIDA GOVERNOR:
 I heard from Ruth Beckman, that you are taking care of her. Praise the
Lord!

She is feeling  so excited, that she is constantly praying to God
by thanking "HIM" and you.
You could feel in her letter the desperation, crying and feeling miserable
of
a woman who thought she was at the end of her rope.
I felt a "pitiful feeling" coming from a woman of her "caliber."
Actually, she got Victory for Hon. State Senator Victor Crist.
Well, it looks like that "blessings" for her is going on her way!
THANKS TO YOU!
That's the reason we are (you and me) on this Earth: To Help People!
And, that includes your family too!
I never wanted to talk to you about your family, Jeb, but I think that now
I want to express my feelings about them. I just want to tell you to help
your daughter as much as you can. If, I was in your shoes, I would do
everything in my power to go help her.  Listen to her, she might have a
story to tell. Don't bother of what people will say or any criticism may
come.

Use your power to help her, and let anybody say whatever they want to say.
If saying this to you help you, I am glad I helped.
Thanks again Governor for making Ruth happy.


CASE #2  REFERENCE: (Eunice Garcia)
I wrote to you some time ago about her problem, and you answered back
to me that Ann Hampton (at least I thought it was her name)
would take care of the matter, but I talked to Eunice and she tells me you
referred "Melissa" to her.
That was several months ago (year 2002) and to this date, she hasn't heard
anything, nothing from her.
We all know that in the private sector, people "follow-thru" with regrets or
good news, but No, her silence has been perfect.
Right now, Eunice is in Cuba, trying to buy her two brothers (Adolfo and
Jorge Luis Garcia) a VISA to enter USA.
These boys went to the EMBASSY OF SWITZERLAND
in Cuba, to the Department of "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA'S INTEREST SECTION"
to ask for a Visa to USA.
They gave Adolfo Garcia a Receipt # 00028562 in payment of $45.00 for the
MRV Processing, signed by a Consular Officer, at the FEE COLLECTION
DEPT.
After he pays $45.00, the "Jefe of Visas de No-Inmigrantes" sends a letter
"denying the Visa" and saying that he has to wait a whole year to try again.
Adolfo Garcia has a receipt from each year he applied paying $45.00
each year since, 11-15-95; 12-18-1996; 8-19-1997; 3-11-1998; 6-8-2000;
2001 and 2002) he had to pay $45.00 for each year.
What it is happening here is a "revolving door", and this is when she wanted
to ask you for help.
I guess, that, when she comes back from Cuba, she probably bring new ideas
about how to get her family out of Cuba.
I will keep you posted.
We all are living difficult times my dear Governor.
May God help you in your endeavors and bless you and your family.
Your loyal friend,
Gladys Lopez Levy

(2) LEGISLATIVE INTENT. -- It is recognized by the Legislature that the referral of a patient by a health care

The Legislature finds these referral practices may limit or eliminate competitive alternatives in the health care services market, may result in overutilization of health care services, may increase costs to the health care system, and may adversely affect the quality of health care. The Legislature also recognizes, however, that it may be appropriate for providers to own entities providing health care services, and to refer patients to such entities, as long as certain safeguards are present in the arrangement. It is the intent of the Legislature to provide guidance to health care providers regarding prohibited patient referrals between health care providers and entities providing health care services and to
protect the people of Florida from unnecessary and costly health care expenditures.
(3) (o) 3. The following orders, recommendations, or plans of care shall not constitute a referral by a health care

Dear Jeb,

Tom and I have long been supporters of Pace Center for Girls, in Jacksonville and statewide.  As parents of two daughters we appreciate the challenges some young girls have maturing into responsible adult citizens.  The Pace program is a well organized effort to keep these students out of trouble-- consequently out of the penal system. It has been used as a national model for similar programs in other states.  Pace has a 94% success rate, saving tax payers untold dollars.  Prison, the alternative for many, cost much more emotionally and economically.

Jeb if we lose state funding Pace Center for Girls will close.  The communities across the state cannot replace the Department of Juvenile Justice funding.  If we are successful getting funding in the Senate and the House PLEASE consider supporting us.

I know there are many worthy programs and these are tough times so you are in my prayers as always.  My best to Columba.

Sorry that I am getting back to you so late on this one - it has been one busy day!  JC's comments below address most of the issues raised by the reporter.  There is really very little we can do about Cyber High as they are reported as meeting the statutory requirements of the law.  The last part of the reporter's email queried whether or not you would be proposing any new requirements in this legislative session.  I would add that the McKay Scholarship Program has been very successful and that parents are happy with its results. Why fix what is not broken?

Commissioner:

 

Done!  Lori will also meet with me on Monday as we are going to review payment process and our cutting edge technology.  

 

Cyber High met the statutory criteria for participation.  We do not have the authority to deny a lawful application.  Here is the disability breakdown (don't release the numbers to her, they are personally identifiable) A - Educable Mentally Handicapped - 3 Students C - Orthopedically Impaired - 1 Student J - Emotionally Handicapped - 1 Student K - Specific Learning Disabled - 2 Students.  She may have gotten information from the office prior to the school code re-write, the law changed January 7, abolished the deadline (for McKay) alternatively, she may have asked about OSP which still has a deadline.  We do not have the authority to visit private schools and one school has been disqualified from participation in the program (Excellence Academy in Pinellas for Health and Safety issues).  We are not planning to propose any new procedures or oversight of McKay/Opportunity Scholarship schools.  We need to simply enforce current laws.  

 

The questions she posed to you: (with suggestions for response)

 

1.	Do you support requiring private schools to be open for at least a year before being allowed to take McKay/Opportunity Scholarship students? Why or why not?  

 

It may seem like a good idea, but Florida is a rapidly growing state and in some areas of the state this may be difficult to accomplish.  For example in Miami/Dade there are relatively few private schools with seats available.  Do we punish parents who may want to send their child to this school and deny them this opportunity?   When a child fails to make progress in special education or in a low-performing public school parents should have adequate options and recourse.

 

 

2.	Do you support requiring private schools to employ certified teachers for McKay/Opportunity students? Why or why not? 

 

Florida is currently experiencing a shortage of teachers. If there were an abundance of certified teachers in our state we may want to take a close look at this issue.  However, as it stands now we may not be able to fill our public schools with certified teachers.   We want men and women who are qualified teaching children, which is why I support alternative certification to assist in meeting the demands in our classrooms and the recently passed class size amendment.

Subject: request for an interview regarding McKay scholarships and Cyber High

Secretary Horne, 
I am seeking your comments for an Orlando Sentinel story that I'm planning to write about McKay Scholarship private schools. Some of my story is focusing on Cyber High in Seminole County, a Sanford private school that has approval from the state to accept students with McKay Scholarships. I was wondering whether you could tell me why DOE officials decided to approve this school's application to enroll McKay students.

Here is some background: Cyber High previously operated as a charter school in Orange and Seminole. Both school boards closed the charter schools for several reasons, including financial mismanagement. The governor and Cabinet denied Cyber High's request to have its charter reinstated after it was revoked in Orange County. Seminole sued the Cyber High in January to recover computer equipment that Cyber High allegedly did not return after the school was closed.

Were DOE officials aware of Cyber High's history? If so, what role, if any, did that play into the decision to approve Cyber High's application to accept McKay students?

Lastly, during this legislative session, are you planning to propose any new procedures that would tighten the oversight of McKay/Opportunity Scholarship schools? If so, could you possibly describe what changes you would like to see made to the program? 

Secretary Horne. 

Do you support requiring private schools to be open for at least a year before being allowed to take McKay/Opportunity Scholarship students? Why or why not?

Do you support requiring private schools to employ certified teachers for McKay/Opportunity students? Why or why not? 

Thank you very much for your time,

Jeb:

La entrevista es hoy a las 2:00 p.m.  Hora por que sea lo que Dios quiera para el, nuestra familia y lo que Milton pueda hacer por la sociedad.

?Que te parece el "Florida's Freedom Initiative" que Shelly te envio?  Con relacion a su propuesta de FCC, le voy a sugerir que usen algunos de los fondos para que emplen personas con discapacidades.  Tenemos que demonstrarle a nuestra sociedad que personas con discapacidades "SI PUEDEN".  Tal vez sera un poco dificil al principio, pere si no tomamos el primer paso nunca nos moveremos hacia adelante. Los FCC es un vehiculo ideal para promover esa iniciativa.

Ya sabes que te queremos, y te respetamos.  Eres nuestro mejor defensor.  GRACIAS, y QUE DIOS TE BENDIGA.

Jeb:

It was such a pleasure to meet with you yesterday.  I like the Miami
office MUCH better than the Tallahassee one.  It's less intimidating,
and informal which made me feel more conformable.

I hope that with Shelly's advise you are able to include the FCC in your
CAFE line item.  The FCC are a great POTENTIAL resource that needs to
get the needed support to be able to move the system forward in the
right direction.  Please, make sure to read the written information that
I gave you on the subject.  Don't forget to ask Julie Shaw for a copy of
the state Medicaid report.  I have not been able to get a copy as it's
apparently being rewritten.

On your testimony on the Medicaid reform.  I hope that the disability
community doesn't get upset with you. Based on the Principles of Self
Determination and consumer directed SUPPORTS, some of the information
that I gathered is a follow:

1. There is a clear institutional bias in Medicaid

2. Community is the preferred way of living for the vast majority of all
individuals with disabilities including those who are aging.

3. Traditionally, individuals with disabilities have had to surrender
their basic freedoms in order to secure support under the Medicaid
program.

4. Today, there is a growing movement for "self-determination" or
consumer directed supports.

5. We have to find a way to address the growing population of
individuals who need Medicaid funding for supports and become much more
cost effective.

6. States do not know what to do. The initial reaction is to seize
flexibility from the Federal Government (not a bad thing by itself) and
then ration Medicaid. The alternative is to design a new system based on
real freedom and real value--i.e.. cost effectiveness.  

The time has come to fundamentally change the Medicaid law and
regulations as well as the law and regulations surrounding SSI/SSDI
under Social Security.  Medicaid is irretrievably broken.    The new
system of the future (TOM NERNEY) needs to be:

1. more cost effective

2. founded on real choice and self-determination

3. much more flexible than the present system. (see "The System of the
Future")

4. Encourage work not discourage it like the present system does.

I will try to gather more information, and sent to you by the end of the
day.  Tu eres "LA VOZ".  Que Dios te bendiga, te ilumine, y te de
sabiduria.

Gracias por todo.

Berthy

        The 11th Circuit has just affirmed our victory before Judge Moore re: Choose Life tag on grounds that none of the plaintiffs had standing.  Particularly significant is the 11th Circuit's affirmance of the order dismissing the Governor as a proper party, relying on Luckey v. Harris and Harris v.

Thanks for all your help on this case, and for allowing us to handle it!!!   As an aside, I understand this is now the No. 1 selling tag in Florida, in large part because of all the publicity the plaintiffs' lawsuits generate!!

Governor, last night Governor Patton's director took blame for delaying the
process.  He has been in Kentucky and apparently the Kentucky legislature
closed out the Kentucky Washington DC office effective next August (leaving
it open only through Patton's term at NGA)  but I do believe they drag their
feet for typical NGA reasons.

The plan now is to announce the formation of the task force on Monday.  It
was limited to 10, they removed Governor  Bredensen (TN).  The following are
the 5 Ds: Patton, O';Bannon, Vislack, Richardson, Holden.  The Rs ramain
Kempthorne, Bush, Rowland, Erhlich, Hoeven.

The cochairs, Patton and Kempthorne, will likely call for a Governor's

   FROM THE DESK OF JON B. RAWLSON	  <http://www.pharmerica.com/>
PharMerica
    www.pharmerica.com <http://www.pharmerica.com/>

Jeb -

I read your comments this morning which you gave before the Energy &
Commerce Subcommittee on Health last week and thought they were right on! I
have a few items to offer for your consideration as you move forward on the
NGA/RGA task force:

*	Federal resources for those "dually eligible" patients - should be
significantly increased and would certainly help provide some relief to the
states. I was in a small meeting last week with Doug Badger - who as you
know serves in the President's Economic Policy shop - and he agreed that
this is an area of concern and one where the Administration believes they
help.

*

	You recognized the strain on current providers to the Medicaid
program. You just can't over emphasize that point. We - my company - and our
small part of the pharmacy industry serve just long term care -
patients/residents of nursing homes. We have fixed costs which are much
higher than retail pharmacy and yet are reimbursed by the same method. The
squeeze we are feeling due to the state's fiscal pressures is significant.
We serve a disproportionably higher percentage of that population (over 60%)
and so we have no where to go. We are heavily regulated - at the state and
federal levels - and states like MA and CA are adding to that burden, which
as you know, has a significant cost factor. We are in the single digit
profit margin and the future doesn't look that good. Further straining the
providers could lead to significant change in the services for that
population who are both elderly and fragile.
*

	Another consideration for Florida - but not necessarily the case for
other states is that you have achieved most of the savings available in the
prescription drug area through the innovative approaches taken over the last
2 years. There really isn't much left in that area and additional pressures
can only compromise the services to the patient population we serve.

Jeb - as you move forward in the dialogue with the Task Force, I would
appreciate the opportunity to offer suggestions and ideas on other reforms
within Medicaid. If you have any thoughts on how we could help in this
process, please be sure to let me know. Also, I think you know that I am on
the JMI Board - if JMI could help in any way - we would be pleased to do so.


Thanks.
Jon

Dear Governor,
 
    It sure was a surprise and pleasure having you attend the Cattlemen's Reception. What an honor to be able to ride up the elevator with you.
 
    I was in Tallahassee with the Wedgeworth Leadership Institute for Agriculture and Natural Resources (formerly, the Florida Leadership Program for Agriculture & Natural Resources) in which I am an alumnist. I had the opportunity to meet with many legislators over two day's, but I must say the highlight was talking with you and seeing you handle a lariat.
 
    I wanted to pass along a little information I picked up. In speaking with various cattlemen and member's of the Ag. Coalition, they are concerned that you do not have someone on your staff that has an ag background. Now, don't get me wrong, they all love you and the job you are doing for the state. However, they would like to see someone on your staff that has an ag background.
 
    Which brings me to address, once again, the possibility of having an agriculture liaison. I know that we have a trusted Agriculture Commissioner and Charlie is doing a great job, but it sure would be nice to have someone on your staff that can do outreach to this industry. An industry that kept Florida afloat during the downturn in tourism. Of course, I believe with my diversified background, I'm the person for the job. Please think about it.
 
    Again, thank you for attending the reception, as always, I am praying for your leadership and especially your brother's.
 
Sincerely,

Subject:	Re: Juveniles at the detention center

Good afternoon. My name is Melissa Zelniker and I am an attorney that works
with children who are both dependent and delinquent. In working with these
children, I have come across two issues that raise many red flags. Both have
to do with children who are housed at the detention center who either 1)
have been sentenced to 21 days 2) are awaiting placement at a Department of
Juvenile Justice facility.

For children at the detention center who are either serving 21 days or
awaiting placement, there are no services being offered to them. To clarify,
there is no counseling provided whatsoever, no provisions made for special
education students, no substance abuse help and the education they are
receiving is horrific. I had a client awaiting trial who asked to start
studying for a GED so he could better himself and he was told that he cannot
have access to that book and that the GED program was not offered there. I
had another client with a substance abuse problem who was crying out for
help. He asked if he could get counseling and was told that this was a
service not provided in detention. If we are trying to make these children
better citizens and trying to rehabilitate them before they become adult
offenders, why is the state of Florida not providing them with the services
they so desperately need? The detention center has become for the most part
a place where children are warehoused. Their families have failed them,
their schools have failed them, and now the system is failing them. I also
had a client over there who tried to commit suicide and was given no proper
crisis counseling. When I went to visit him his wrists were cut and he
related to me that he had lost all hope.

My second issue which relates to this is that juveniles held at detention
awaiting placement at their program do not get credit time served. I had a
client who waited almost 120 days for a placement. On top of that, he had to
complete a 12 month program and got no credit for serving time at the
detention center. I had another client who tried to commit suicide because
he had been waiting for over 90 days to be placed. When we brought this
issue in front of the judge, there was nothing that he could do. I explained
to him that the child needed some stability since he was a foster child and
had been sitting at detention for 90 days. I also explained to the court
that the child tried to kill himself and was not receiving any services in
detention. Although all parties involved felt bad, nobody could help. The
waiting list for some of these  Department of Juvenile Justice Programs can
be up to a year, even more in some cases while children languish at the
detention center with improper educational services, no substance abuse
counseling or any other form of counseling for that matter, no GED services
- no services at all.

I am truly concerned about this situation. In an effort to help my clients,
I have tried everything possible to get them services. The state of Florida
needs to take notice of this issue and provide services for these children.
If we provided services for them and became proactive we would be able to
deal with many of their psychological, physical and emotional needs before
these kids become adult offenders.

These children are in desperate need of help, especially those who I
represent who are in both the foster care and juvenile justice system. They
are crying out for help- literally. I am afraid for the day that I get a
phone call that one of my clients has taken his/her own life. Let's provide
these children with the services they so desperately need. I am willing to
help in any way possible. Thank you for your time and consideration to this
matter.


Sincerely,

Melissa Zelniker

Governor Bush (aka Jeb): 

Based on our conversation in Tallahassee on Tuesday, we have already started putting things in place for hosting your first town hall meeting on the medical malpractice crisis. We can host this at either Baptist Hospital or South Miami Hospital (Clark Educational Center). We have almost 2000 private practicing physicians affiliated with BH-hospitals who are caught in this quagmire. Few, if any, of the high-risk specialties like OB and neurosurgery, are able to secure insurance and hence have “gone bare”.

We expect a standing-room only crowd consisting of older patients, “white coats” and nurses and other caregivers. We are also in the process of gathering a number of patients who have been adversely affected by the med mal problem in terms of reduced access.

Please let us know who we need to work with on your staff to coordinate this event.

Hi Jeb! How are you?
You should know that I am behind you and your brother 300%.
I prayed and prayed for you to get re-elected. I am so proud of you.
Im 14 years old and I live in Riverview Florida. My entire family
is a LONG line of republicans. I wrote Senators Bob Graham and
Bill Nelson, to tell them what awful people they were for not
supporting our nobel president. And I also said they needed to have
his back with the whole economy thing. Im a member of the
RNC. And my dad bought 12,  25$ mouse pads that say "Proud to

Anyways I got suspended on Tuesday. It started yesterday and ends
today. I believe more than half of my teachers are liberals.
Which unfortunetly pretty much everyone in the school system is.
But my Math teacher, was saying how "dont blame us for the FCAT"
she says "blame your govener we dont like it ither.Write him and tell
him about it." Then she started trash talking and I think sway they're 
opinions. Then the kids started talking about you. Well I got mad and
said a few choice words. It just makes me so mad when people talk
about you and my president. I dont know how they could.Im not
about to let them talk about you like that without saying something back.
But at least I am in honor role. Well I hope you can write me.

Dear Governor,
I spend all day yesterday taking Oracene Price (formerly Oracene Williams)
mother of Venus and Serena Williams, on a tour of the First Serve sites in
Immokalee and Ft. Myers.  She very much liked what she saw and accepted my
invitation to attend (in a non-speaking role) the press conference on
Monday.  I am forwarding this information to LIza so she can work your
acknowledging Oracene into your remarks.  We are hoping that Oracene's

All the best and see you on Monday.

Hi Jeb,

Hope you are doing well.  You are certainly doing a great job especially
under the current circumstances.  I truly believe you're the best Governor
our State has ever had.

I know you are busy so I'll keep it short.  Attached is a formal letter, to
Deputy Assistant Secretary Doug Baker, proposing that Bill Peeper be
appointed to the Advisory Board reviewing the use of the $50 million fund
for international tourism marketing.  Bill would be perfect for this as
indicated in my letter.  It would be great if you would kindly endorse his
appointment with Secretary Baker.

Thank you for your assistance and I hope to see you again soon.  Also,
please let me know if I can be of any help to you at any time.

Best regards,

Cyber High met the statutory criteria for participation.  They did provide the Department of Education with a statement by a certified public accountant confirming that the private school desiring to participate is insured and the owner or owners have sufficient capital or credit to operate the school for the upcoming year serving the number of students anticipated with expected revenues from tuition and other sources that may be reasonably expected.  Call me if you get a chance or need additional info!  JC

Here is the relevant portion of the law:

4)  PRIVATE SCHOOL ELIGIBILITY.--To be eligible to participate in the John M. McKay Scholarships for Students with Disabilities Program, a private school must be a Florida private school, may be sectarian or nonsectarian, and must: 

(a)  Demonstrate fiscal soundness by being in operation for 1 school year or provide the Department of Education with a statement by a certified public accountant confirming that the private school desiring to participate is insured and the owner or owners have sufficient capital or credit to operate the school for the upcoming year serving the number of students anticipated with expected revenues from tuition and other sources that may be reasonably expected. In lieu of such a statement, a surety bond or letter of credit for the amount equal to the scholarship funds for any quarter may be filed with the department. 

(b)  Notify the Department of Education of its intent to participate in the program under this section. The notice must specify the grade levels and services that the private school has available for students with disabilities who are participating in the scholarship program. 

(c)  Comply with the antidiscrimination provisions of 42 U.S.C. s. 2000d. 

(d)  Meet state and local health and safety laws and codes. 

(e)  Be academically accountable to the parent for meeting the educational needs of the student. 

(f)  Employ or contract with teachers who hold baccalaureate or higher degrees, or have at least 3 years of teaching experience in public or private schools, or have special skills, knowledge, or expertise that qualifies them to provide instruction in subjects taught. 

(g)  Comply with all state laws relating to general regulation of private schools. 

(h)  Adhere to the tenets of its published disciplinary procedures prior to the expulsion of a scholarship student

Here are my notes to Commissioner, which is where Lori is heading:

 

Commissioner:

 

Done!  Lori will also meet with me on Monday as we are going to review payment process and our cutting edge technology.  

 

Cyber High met the statutory criteria for participation.  We do not have the authority to deny a lawful application.  Here is the disability breakdown (don't release the numbers to her, they are personally identifiable) A - Educable Mentally Handicapped - 3 Students C - Orthopedically Impaired - 1 Student J - Emotionally Handicapped - 1 Student K - Specific Learning Disabled - 2 Students.  She may have gotten information from the office prior to the school code re-write, the law changed January 7, abolished the deadline (for McKay) alternatively, she may have asked about OSP which still has a deadline.  We do not have the authority to visit private schools and one school has been disqualified from participation in the program (Excellence Academy in Pinellas for Health and Safety issues).  We are not planning to propose any new procedures or oversight of McKay/Opportunity Scholarship schools.  We need to simply enforce current laws.  

 

The questions she posed to you: (with suggestions for response)

 

1.	Do you support requiring private schools to be open for at least a year before being allowed to take McKay/Opportunity Scholarship students? Why or why not?  

 

It may seem like a good idea, but Florida is a rapidly growing state and in some areas of the state this may be difficult to accomplish.  For example in Miami/Dade there are relatively few private schools with seats available.  Do we punish parents who may want to send their child to this school and deny them this opportunity?   When a child fails to make progress in special education or in a low-performing public school parents should have adequate options and recourse.

 

 

2.	Do you support requiring private schools to employ certified teachers for McKay/Opportunity students? Why or why not? 

 

Florida is currently experiencing a shortage of teachers. If there were an abundance of certified teachers in our state we may want to take a close look at this issue.  However, as it stands now we may not be able to fill our public schools with certified teachers.   We want men and women who are qualified teaching children, which is why I support alternative certification to assist in meeting the demands in our classrooms and the recently passed class size amendment.

Subject: request for an interview regarding McKay scholarships and Cyber High

Secretary Horne, 
I am seeking your comments for an Orlando Sentinel story that I'm planning to write about McKay Scholarship private schools. Some of my story is focusing on Cyber High in Seminole County, a Sanford private school that has approval from the state to accept students with McKay Scholarships. I was wondering whether you could tell me why DOE officials decided to approve this school's application to enroll McKay students.

Here is some background: Cyber High previously operated as a charter school in Orange and Seminole. Both school boards closed the charter schools for several reasons, including financial mismanagement. The governor and Cabinet denied Cyber High's request to have its charter reinstated after it was revoked in Orange County. Seminole sued the Cyber High in January to recover computer equipment that Cyber High allegedly did not return after the school was closed.

Were DOE officials aware of Cyber High's history? If so, what role, if any, did that play into the decision to approve Cyber High's application to accept McKay students?

Lastly, during this legislative session, are you planning to propose any new procedures that would tighten the oversight of McKay/Opportunity Scholarship schools? If so, could you possibly describe what changes you would like to see made to the program? 

Secretary Horne. 

Do you support requiring private schools to be open for at least a year before being allowed to take McKay/Opportunity Scholarship students? Why or why not?

Do you support requiring private schools to employ certified teachers for McKay/Opportunity students? Why or why not? 

Thank you very much for your time,

Dear Governor,

I trust you were pleased with the seamless transition of chairmanship
Wednesday.  I am sure Nick Gutierrez will do a fine job.

I wanted to let you know that I recommended the board that we establish an
in-house land acquisition oversight committee. This committee would include
the executive director, general council, deputy of land acquisition, CFO and
a governing board member.  This would service as a check and balance and
accountability measure on all land deals before they get to the Gov Board.
This would also allow for some out of the box thinking.

Thank your again for the opportunity to serve.

Dear Mr. Woodring,

Thank you for your invitation to meet informally anytime I am in Tallahassee.  I will make sure to take you up on your kind and generous offer.  However, I think you misunderstood my previous e-mail to Shan Goff.  This request is regarding the meeting that is scheduled for March 21, 2003 in Tallahassee as a follow-up to our meeting in South Florida with Berthy de la Rosa Aponte, Milton Aponte, Michael Boswell, Laura Prado, Kim McDougal and you regarding the proposed ESE Rules related to the procedural safeguards for students with disabilities.  I  was just requesting the meeting location and driving directions, but if there is a problem in providing this information to me ahead of time, or if perhaps Shan is not aware of the meeting location, then I will just get it from Berthy or Michael.  God willing, I will definitely be there.

Executive Director 
Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission 


Dear Jeb & Ken: 

I just had a call from Terry Tomalin, writer for The St. Petersburg Times.  

His first question was:  "Commissioner Meehan, what to you think of the Urban Pond Program?"  
        I told him I thought it was a good thing for kids and families in urban areas to have a fishing opportunity.  

He then said, "don't you (Commissioner Meehan) think it is a shame that the Governor is going to cut it out of the budget?"

        I said that we're customarily adjusting our budget and priorities; we have many existing programs and requests for additional programs, and we are customarily trying to        balance our resources and our budget.

Also, I told Terry that if you have to have a budget cut, then some areas of the budget have to be reduced, and then we do it on a priority basis.


I don't know where Terry will take this story. 

Kindest personal regards, 
David

Governor Bush:
Good afternoon.  I hope things are going well with you.
I know you are extremely busy, but I wanted to pass along
the names of some folks who were instrumental in helping the
First Lady and her security detail make their connecting flight
yesterday at DFW.

Patti Jones (who works in my office and knows your Mansion staff well)
coordinated everything after receiving a call from FDLE agents Carrie Poole 
and Scott Bovee.  She was assisted in Dallas/Ft. Worth by Gauty Deliz
(one of our Red Coats) and Kimberly Slack (who handles premium service
issues.)  

The two folks at DFW (Gauty and Kimberly) worked with U.S. Customs to
expedite the arrival process, and they also worked with the Captain on the
Tallahassee flight, who held the flight until Mrs. Bush and the security
folks arrived.

Delta is fortunate to have excellent employees like these three, who go 
the extra mile for our customers.  Delta was founded and built on principles
of good customer service, and I think these three exemplify the best
qualities
of our company.

I just wanted you to be aware of some of the "behind the scenes" work that
normally goes unnoticed by the flying public.

I appreciate your continued support of Delta.

Sincerely,

Blake

Activities Report 
 
 
Week of March 10, 2003 – March 14, 2003
 
Rule Hearing Scheduled:  A rule hearing is scheduled for April 16, 2003 in Room 143 of the Larson Building.  The hearing on Rule 4-137.001 regarding the Annual and Quarterly Reporting Requirements and Rule 4-138.001 is regarding the NAIC Financial Examiners Handbook Adopted.  Both of the rules are to adopt the 2003 manuals.
 
Legal Orders Issued:
 
A Consent Order with Hudson Insurance Company and WNC First Insurance Services was executed on March 14, 2003.  Hudson Insurance Company is a licensed foreign property and casualty insurer, writing multiple lines in Florida.  WNC Insurance Services, Inc. is a corporation qualified and authorized to transact business in Florida who applied for registration of its fictitious name as WNC First by the Department of State on January 18, 2002.  WNC First is a corporation licensed by the Office as a managing general agent by Hudson.  Hudson is currently providing flood coverage through WNC First to about 27 residential risks.  Hudson’s current flood insurance policy does not include sinkhole coverage.  For their “all perils” coverage, Hudson’s insureds are covered either by an admitted insurer or surplus lines insurer.  Hudson and WNC First acknowledge and agree that residential property coverage is required to be comprehensive, and that such coverage must include an offer of coverage for sinkhole loss, through WNC First with every flood coverage policy.  Upon execution of this consent order, WNC First shall use duly licensed and appointed Florida general lines agents as producers for the admitted business, and licensed and appointed Florida surplus lines agents as producers for the non-admitted business.  The Consent Order applies not only to the 27 residential property risks, but applies to such further residential property risks as may be written using a combination of the flood policy and “all perils” policies.  
 
A Consent Order with Wausau General Insurance Company was executed on March 14, 2003 to remove the company from the list of eligible surplus lines insurers.  The company will continue to honor all claims and liabilities in Florida and make its books and records available to the Office upon request.  This action was at the company's request.
 
A Consent Order with Liberty American Insurance Company was executed on March 14, 2003.  As a result of a Market Conduct examination report, the Office determined that the insurer failed to follow filed rate, rating schedule or rating rule (multiple lines), failed to provide timely notice of renewal, non-renewal or cancellation, failed to provide specific reason for denial, cancellation or non-renewal, failed to deliver policy timely and failed to properly adjust claim per policy requirements.
 
An Order of Revocation against Robert Wendel Maresca, age 49, of Rockledge, Florida was executed on March 14, 2003.  Mr. Maresca is currently licensed in this state as an All Lines Adjuster (5-20).  On August 20, 2002, the former Department of Insurance (now Office of Insurance Regulation) filed a two (2) count Administrative Complaint against Robert Wendel Maresca alleging that he pled nolo contendere to extortion in Volusia County in April 2002, while licensed as an All Lines Adjuster and failed to notify the Department of the plea.  The Administrative Complaint was served upon the agent by publication on December 19th & 26th, 2002 and January 2nd & 9th, 2003 in accordance with Section 120.60(5), Florida Statutes, and the agent has failed to respond to these charges or request a proceeding within the time required by the law.
 
A Cease and Desist Order against Mayaluca Gayot, age 24, of Ft. Lauderdale, Florida was executed on March 14, 2003.  Ms. Gayot is not licensed in this state as an insurance adjuster.  A Notice of Intent to Issue a Cease and Desist Order was filed October 11, 2002, alleging that the Respondent was transacting insurance adjusting business in the State of Florida without a license.  The Respondent’s reply to the Notice of Intent to Issue a Cease and Desist Order states that she does not dispute any of the Department’s allegations and she does not desire a hearing.  
 
An Administrative Complaint against Kelly K. Augustine, age 32, of Olathe, Kansas, was executed on March 14, 2003.  Ms. Augustine is currently licensed in this state as a Nonresident Company Adjuster – Motor Vehicle Physical Damage (7-21) and a Nonresident Company Adjuster – Property and Casualty (7-44).  She holds no appointments.  This one (1) count Administrative Complaint alleges that Ms. Augustine was convicted of felony charges less than twelve (12) months prior to filing her application on August 20, 2001, and that she falsely answered three (3) questions on the application relating to the convictions.  The Administrative Complaint will be served on the above-referenced agent in accordance with Section 120.60(5), Florida Statutes.  
 
An Administrative Complaint against Kelle Ann Walker, age 32, of Lakewood, Colorado, was executed on March 14, 2003.  Ms. Walker is currently licensed in this state as a Nonresident All Lines Company Adjuster (7-20).  She holds no appointments.

An Administrative Complaint was filed against Rosa Martinez on April 20, 2001, alleging advertising violations and failure to have required elements in contracts with consumers.  The Fraud Division arrested her for related criminal violations.  The criminal disposition included entering into a licensure revocation agreement with the Office of Insurance Regulation.  This Settlement Stipulation for Consent Order has the same force and effect as a licensure revocation and a removal action from future insurance involvement in Florida.

Ms. Anthony is currently licensed as a Nonresident All Lines Company Adjuster (7-20).

13 March 2003

 

Jeb,

 

I am looking for someone in  your administration who can help with funding for  a Minister in Belle Glade who has a wonderful faith – based program to help prevent domestic violence. 

 

J. R. Thicklen currently runs a program in Belle Glade that is geared to all ages, youth, young adults, and seniors.   His real gift is the ability to communicate with people of all ages.  His primary goal is the prevention of domestic violence. He also deals with a lot of anger management  that is so prevalent in young blacks. He does have the amazing ability to walk into a classroom of angry 16-19 year old blacks, and get their attention “right now”. 

 

He is an excellent teacher, and can help train clergy of all faiths, teachers, and students. 

 

If you , or anyone in your administration, want to spend 30 minutes with J.R., you will see  what I mean. 

 

He does need some funding to continue and to expand his program in Belle Glade, but  can travel through-out the State as needed. His telephone number is 561-993-2377 and his e-mail address is destinychoice@AOL.com.

 

Any suggestions?

 

Jim Harrell

Subject: Bush # 1 Tampa Bay Jersey


Jeb,
 
If you are not going to wear that Tampa Bay jersey, I'd like to suggest an educational funding use of it.
 

My daughter, Hayley, attends Community Christian School (CCS), which is a 25-year old, inter-denominational pre-K through 9th grade private school of 315 students. They have a $1.6 million annual budget, an average class size of 16 students, and they receive the benefit of over 5,000 volunteer hours annually from the neighbors, friends and family of their students. It's a terrific learning environment and they do an excellent job of preparing kids for success in every aspect of life.
 
In a few weeks, the school is holding its 25th Anniversary Spring Fling & Silent Auction where we expect over 500 people. At last year's auction, a private breakfast with the greatest-ever governor of Florida raised $1,900 for the school. You're a saint! This year, however, I heard we struck out in getting your participation.
 
So, how about signing that "Bush #1" Tampa Bay jersey for us, and allowing us to auction it off in our 25th Anniversary auction? 
 
The Silent Auction is scheduled for April 11, 2003, and I know the jersey would be the highlight of the auction. In fact, if you'd like I will "seed" the bidding pool, if necessary, and be sure it brings in $2,500 or more! 
 
If you would be willing to support CCS in this manner, Hayley, Anne and I would be most appreciative...and I will ask nothing more from you until my re-appointment to the TCC board comes up in a couple months.

Subject: Re: Juveniles at the detention center


Good afternoon. My name is Melissa Zelniker and I am an attorney that works
with children who are both dependent and delinquent. In working with these
children, I have come across two issues that raise many red flags. Both have
to do with children who are housed at the detention center who either 1)
have been sentenced to 21 days 2) are awaiting placement at a Department of
Juvenile Justice facility.

For children at the detention center who are either serving 21 days or
awaiting placement, there are no services being offered to them. To clarify,
there is no counseling provided whatsoever, no provisions made for special
education students, no substance abuse help and the education they are
receiving is horrific. I had a client awaiting trial who asked to start
studying for a GED so he could better himself and he was told that he cannot
have access to that book and that the GED program was not offered there. I
had another client with a substance abuse problem who was crying out for
help. He asked if he could get counseling and was told that this was a
service not provided in detention. If we are trying to make these children
better citizens and trying to rehabilitate them before they become adult
offenders, why is the state of Florida not providing them with the services
they so desperately need? The detention center has become for the most part
a place where children are warehoused. Their families have failed them,
their schools have failed them, and now the system is failing them. I also
had a client over there who tried to commit suicide and was given no proper
crisis counseling. When I went to visit him his wrists were cut and he
related to me that he had lost all hope.

My second issue which relates to this is that juveniles held at detention
awaiting placement at their program do not get credit time served. I had a
client who waited almost 120 days for a placement. On top of that, he had to
complete a 12 month program and got no credit for serving time at the
detention center. I had another client who tried to commit suicide because
he had been waiting for over 90 days to be placed. When we brought this
issue in front of the judge, there was nothing that he could do. I explained
to him that the child needed some stability since he was a foster child and
had been sitting at detention for 90 days. I also explained to the court
that the child tried to kill himself and was not receiving any services in
detention. Although all parties involved felt bad, nobody could help. The
waiting list for some of these  Department of Juvenile Justice Programs can
be up to a year, even more in some cases while children languish at the
detention center with improper educational services, no substance abuse
counseling or any other form of counseling for that matter, no GED services
- no services at all.

I am truly concerned about this situation. In an effort to help my clients,
I have tried everything possible to get them services. The state of Florida
needs to take notice of this issue and provide services for these children.
If we provided services for them and became proactive we would be able to
deal with many of their psychological, physical and emotional needs before
these kids become adult offenders.

These children are in desperate need of help, especially those who I
represent who are in both the foster care and juvenile justice system. They
are crying out for help- literally. I am afraid for the day that I get a
phone call that one of my clients has taken his/her own life. Let's provide
these children with the services they so desperately need. I am willing to
help in any way possible. Thank you for your time and consideration to this
matter.


Sincerely,

Melissa Zelniker

Hi, Governor...

It's good to hear from you. Hope all is well. I would have loved to have
been at your "businessman's meeting" last Monday, but was travelling and
didn't get Slater's e-mail until I returned. I since heard there's going to
be another one and will look forward to participating if that happens. For
what it's worth...I think your idea for a "vote" for a tax increase to cover
the classroom size reduction was genius!! Seems fair to everyone I've talked
too.

I'm actually travelling again today and will provide early next week the
info regarding the two issues Ann brought to your attention. Basically,
Dickinson and Carnival and others are writing another travel-tourism book
and would love you to participate relative to a chapter on the importance of
public-private partnerships within that sector. Bob has sent a couple of
letters that have gone up to Tally but he's not had any response. I'll get
them together and will get them to you.

The Camillus' House situation might have taken care of itself. There were
some local political issues that finally got worked out with Manny Diaz that
some of us worked through. The end result, I believe but will confirm, was
that there is to be a State transfer of some land (DOT???) for the new
facility. As it happens, Dickinson is Chairing that effort as well. I
thought you might be familiar with it since Kislak and Cardenas were
originally involved.
 
I'm planning to get Bob and his wife to join Melanie and me at the
Celebration of Reading event in Bonita on the 28th. If that works out,
perhaps we can discuss both issues for a few minutes.

I'll get the info together for you. Thanks, as always, for your interest.

Dear Governor:

As you may or not be aware, the citizens of Okaloosa County have spent the
past two years raising $180,000.00 to erect a memorial to recognize the
defenders of our Country who have given their lives so that we might be free
today. It's a shame that the Governor's Office of our great state will not
be represented during the dedication ceremony of this unique memorial.
Considering world events, it seems that there has never been a more
important time for the citizens of our Country to show their support for
those who have put their lives on the line so that we might be free.

Just wanted to let you know how pleased my clients (each of which have over 1000 members) and I personally were with how DEP ran two separate, recent outreach efforts. Above and beyond the “normal” (i.e., beyond the admin procedures act points of entry) DEP reached out early in the process to:
 
(1) citizens groups in Tampa Bay and SW Fla on the impaired waters list for their areas; 
 
(2) called a special technical meeting to allow involvement by 3 group representatives in technical meetings with Big Bend Power Station on potential for Dissolved Oxygen and Temperature improvements with DEP’s and the Industry’s consultants. 
 
Alan Hubbard (DEP) was most interested in what we had to say. 
He was a most effective listener, truly listening to our concerns, and seemed to understand what we were asking and saying for what it was worth. 
 
In addition, the industry consultants were better able to respond at this early stage in the process. 
 
Perhaps all or at least the larger permitting decisions should involve one or two such informal meetings early in the process.
 
Very refreshing and excellent government!

Jeb: I read you were traveling to Gitmo. Have you been there before? I was there in 1992 when I was U.S. Attorney. It was then, and remains, a mixture of beautiful waters and mountains in the distant, arid desert land, and, what made the most, and worse, impression, the cruel Cold War "No-Man's Land" perimeter fence. I will never forget seeing the bus taking the Cuban workers from Gitmo back to their homes on the "main land," across a modified "Check-Point Charlie" gate.
 
If you have never seen these things before, ask the base commander to give you the tour of the base along with the sentry posts. You'll be able to see clearly, using binoculars, the town of Guantanamo in the distance across the "No-Man's Land." You'll never forget this. It will serve to fortify your conviction in our good fortune living free in this country, and it will eloquently crystallize the shameful tyranny of Castro and his goons.
 
Have a safe trip!

Governor Bush; 
It has been awhile since we last corresponded, but I would like to take this opportunity to ask that you OPPOSE Bill 64. 
The  industry is currently on track to "die off" from waning support, and its cruelty to these fine animals. This bill will enable greyhound racing to continue. Please let it die it's natural death instead of infusing it with outside "gambling monies". In this time of budget shortfall's I am sure this may be an attractive tax base, but this bill goes beyond hurting many poor people, it also hurts poor defenseless animals, that have no choice. Again, I ask that you oppose Bill 64.

Dear Governor Bush,

I thought maybe you'd have the answer to this question:

I am waiting approval on a Rural Housing Loan through
the Department of Agriculture.  They say they are waiting
for Congress to sign approval for funding.  This has
to happen before I am approved.

Do you know what is holding up the funds?  How long it may
be before they come through?!

Impatiently waiting, :)

Dear Governor Bush, 

I was so pleased to be asked to conduct a workshop on succession planning this year at the Sterling Conference.  Apparently, a lot of companies fail in this area and therefore need some training.  I hope that I'm able to share some practical advise that can be implemented immediately. 

As I was reviewing the Sterling criteria documents, I noted that "diversity" was not included anywhere in the criteria.  As you know, the changing demongraphics of the United States - particularly Florida - are having a significant impact on communities, organizations, society and the nation.  In terms of organizations, employee morale, productivity and overall success will depend on how well organizations create environments that maximize the utilization of all employees.  Studies show that those organizations that foster understanding and harmony among diverse workers achieve greater results. 

It occurred to me that perhaps it is time to consider revising the criteria and include diversity as either a new catagory for organizational performance excellence and/or under the core values and concepts section. 

As a diversity trainer/HR consultant and as the Chair of the Florida Commission on Human Relations, I am well aware of the benefits of diversity and hope that you will consider this request.  If I can be of any assistance in crafting new language, I would welcome the opportunity to volunteer my time. 

Thank you.

Dear Governor
My husband Britt McKinley Mulhollem is a 100% service connected  Disabled Vietnam Veteran and a Career Service Employee with permanent status with the State of Florida  D.O.T. for 10 years . 
I have had the occasion to seek out your assistance in the past for
a 'flag incident' at the Ocala office of the DOT.
Thank you for that!
 
Today my husband  is feeling like a second class citizen,  because not only was he terminated from his position with DOT as a EAS level II road inspector (ONLY) because  he was injured on the job!! ,( non chargeable accident! )  He asked for special accommodation and was denied, he asked for his right to the grievance process as a career service employee, and asked to be put on administrative leave with pay while he went through the grievance process, and was also denied this request! Then today I watched with amazement on FOX NEWS that the so called 'tenured professor' from the Univ. of South Florida was finally terminated from his job, but only after having been on administrative leave with pay since Sept. 2001,!! and they made it clear that he was able to enjoy this because he was a 'tenured' employee! and had 'rights'!!!
well, I guess you have to be a criminal  to get administrative leave with pay! (actually we know of a co- worker of Britt's who has been arrested on felony charges more than once, and has never lost a penny of pay let alone being terminated!) I guess this tells you that the 'good ol' boy' mentality is alive and well in District V sir!
 
Governor,  I must tell you that there is something wrong with this picture!  not only is is the State losing a  dependable, loyal employee  ( and we believe wrongfully terminated!) but the State of Florida  won't afford him the same rights that  a terrrorist sympathizer (maybe more!) is given?
 
not happy in Ocala!
Karen Mulhollem

Ringling Museum attracts visitors from all over the United States and the world, a substantial economic benefit to many counties in southwest Florida.  It should be supported because the financial return to our State is great.
 
Sadly, funding for Ringling was abysmally poor for fifty years - such a waste of such a unique and valuable resource.

Jeb:

I presume you may have seen this article; if not I have included it below.
What is happening here is NOT isolated to Collier County. Local governments
do these "favors" for land speculators with property in the path of ALL
government improvements; roads and expressways are even more frequent
targets than environmental land purchases.

We are having similar activity go on in the Wekiva area, affecting BOTH
parcels of land on the environmental purchase lists, AND lands involved in
the right of way for the extension of the Western Beltway. 

Because Rich Crotty and Orange County would not engage in price inflating
scams, speculators have recruited the City of Apopka to annex the key
areas, affecting both environmental parcels and the expressway corridor
recommended by the Wekiva Task Force. 

State action to intervene in and prevent local plan amendments and similar
actions that are thinly disguised efforts to jack up prices is one of those
"compelling state interest" issues that DCA ought to be drawing a sharp
focus on.  

In a targeted sense, moving forward to quickly implement the Wekiva Task
Force recommendations will help stop this activity in the Wekiva area, but
my larger recommendation to you is that we need to move much more quickly
to focus DCA on "compelling state interest" issues like this one throughout
the state and REALLY get the agency active protecting key ecosystem areas
targeted for purchase as well as major transportation corridors...

Governor criticizes Collier in Southern Golden Gate Estates land buy

   By V.J. EPSTEIN, The News-Press Tallahassee Bureau

TALLAHASSEE — Gov. Jeb Bush angrily postponed a key land buy Thursday after
learning  that speculators had positioned themselves to profit
from state Everglades restoration efforts in Southern Golden Gate Estates.

“We need to start second guessing Collier County on this,” Bush said during
a Cabinet meeting after state workers told him officials there had
enabled the purchases by allowing land destined for government purchase to
be privately acquired and then divided into smaller parcels for resale
to the state.

“It makes no sense in terms of real-world common sense to have our partner
on this — a county government — going one way and us going
another,” Bush said, adding that the relationship between the Collier tax
collector and property appraiser and the two speculators made him
“queasy.”

Officials for both offices denied any wrongdoing.

Property Appraiser Abe Skinner said he didn’t realize the routine division
applications handled by his office were filed for a questionable purpose.

The speculators, John Piper and Richard Berman, could not be reached for
comment.


   1.  Property owners stop paying property taxes on the land.

   2. The land goes to auction by Collier County.

   3. Speculators outbid the state for the properties because the state
only can bid 125 percent of the appraised value.

   4. The county then approves the request to have the land subdivided --
for example into five lots.

   5. If the owners won't sell, condemning the land cost the state more
because it has to file a lawsuit on each lot or buy each lot separately.


Southern Golden Gate Estates is a sparsely populated area south of
Interstate 75 and east of Naples that has never been developed as
envisioned. Many property owners usually owe back taxes because the taxes
are worth more than the property.

Florida has been trying to acquire the 55,000-acre area since 1984 and has
spent $94 million on 19,283 parcels there.

The state needs to acquire another 703 parcels (comprising 3,000 acres) to
wrap up the restoration project, which is a key part the Save Our
Everglades Florida Forever project.

The state Department of Environmental Protection has been buying land in
the Estates from willing sellers, at up to 125 percent of its appraised
value, and acquires land from unwilling sellers at market price under
eminent domain law.

The department can be forced to bid against other buyers on land auctioned
by the county tax collector to satisfy back taxes, but that rarely
happens because all land in the area is ultimately destined for state use.

Subject: Status of Situation at the Piney Point Phosphogypsum Stack


Governor:

Secretary Struhs asked that I update you on the status of the dangerous situation at the Piney Point phosphogypsum stack on the edge of Tampa Bay.  This weekend we expect the St. Pete Times and the Tampa Tribune will cover this week's events:

1) We briefed key legislators on the situation publicly and privately.

2) EPA Administrator, Christie Whitman, was briefed on our pending application for an emergency permit to disperse treated phosphoric wastewater from the site into the Gulf of Mexico.  She has not yet approved the application.  Secretary Struhs intends to call her this weekend.

3) The Department of State has been handling the diplomatic effort related to notifying Mexico of the plan.  This has, understandably, been overshadowed by Mexico's current role as a temporary member of the UN Security Council.

BACKGROUND
There is a high risk of the stack failing, resulting in a catastrophic release of untreated, highly acidic wastewater (ph of 3) into Tampa Bay.  The high risk of stack failure is caused by recent extreme rainfall at the site, the arrival of rainy El Nino spring weather patterns, followed by Florida’s summer rainy season and overlaid with an active hurricane season.

To reduce risk of stack failure, we have done emergency pumping of two million gallons a day of partially treated wastewater from the stack into Bishops Harbor.  As a result of this concentrated release, we are experiencing significant algal blooms and rapidly deteriorating water quality.  This will be exacerbated as seasonal temperatures rise.

If EPA approves our application for an emergency permit, we will be prepared to treat the wastewater, neutralize the acid levels, and pipe the treated wastewater from the stack to barges.  The barges will take the treated material outside of Tampa Bay, and gradually disperse it over an area of several hundred miles.  With appropriate release rates from the barge, the dilution effect will allow us to meet all marine water quality standards.

EPA's approval for emergency ocean disposal is based on meeting a three part test:
1) Is it a true emergency?
2) Is there a risk to human life?
3) Have all other alternatives been exhausted?

This situation meets this test.  An unprecedented one-in-500 year rainfall in December-January has placed extreme pressure on the stack's elevated berms.  A structural failure is most likely to occur during a rain event, which is when we have personnel deployed at the site to monitor conditions.  Further, in the event of a failure, Highway 41 could potentially be in the path of the surcharge.  The highway is approximately 400 feet away from the edge of the site.

Apart from the potential loss of life and physical damage from the sudden release of the water, the longer lasting environmental damage would be catastrophic.

In 1997, when a "small" failure occurred at another stack, approximately 50 million gallons of untreated acidic wastewater entered the Alafia River.  Essentially all animal and plant life was killed in a 30 mile stretch of the river, including an estimated one million fish.

The situation at Piney Point is an order of magnitude greater.  Should there be a failure, as much as 500 million gallons of untreated acidic wastewater could be released directly into Tampa Bay.

David will be pressing Governor Whitman to not further delay issuance of the emergency permit.  He will be emphasizing the fact that environmental groups in Florida support this plan as well as marine scientists from every state bordering the Gulf coast.  The ocean dispersal plan will have no toxic effect on marine life, and the nutrient loading effects on water quality are minimal in the open water of the Gulf.  A sudden release into Tampa Bay, by comparison, would be an environmental disaster.

Dear Jeb,
You don't have to answer...
Just wanted you to know my dad, past Chairman of SWIFTMUD, is patting
you on the back today from his grave over your appointment of Judy
Whitehead.
Sometimes I can't help but think,  "why doesn't the Governor ask my
opinion.?"
I am here, he is there!
Ridiculous as that my seem, I am protective of you and have strong
opinions of the people I want to surround you!  I am 3 generations
Floridian.......most of your appointments I have known through the
generations!  Mac Stepanovich gives me the greatest chuckle!  Mac and I
were raised in Gainesville and went to high school together.  He wins
for being a "character!"
It is most difficult for me to sit back, but you ALWAYS COME THROUGH.
It NEVER fails, NEVER, that you appoint the person of my choice.
So we communicate always on the same channel, with the same criteria,
with the same thoughts..I guess we pray on the same channel...STRAIGHT
UP!!!
Thought for the day: from Jay Leno:
If France and Germany are our friends, I guess Hilliary and Bill have a
great marriage."
Better close, as I am getting into trouble now!
Always available to help you for the betterment of our State, never
forget that.
 I will serve where needed.

Subject:	Proclamation for Florida's Troops

Dear Rep JC: 

For your consideration, I have a suggestion. 
Because I am fed up with these anti-war, read anti-Bush, anti-capitalist, anti-American, protestors!   And, because Florida is contributing a lot of active soldiers, reserves, and National Guardsmen for the war preparations.  And, because we owe them such a tremendous debt of gratitude.  And our President too! 

Would it be possible for the Florida legislature and our Governor to make a resolution or proclamation and set a date to honor and pay tribute to FLORIDA'S soldiers, reserves, guardsmen for their courage and sacrifice and to our COMMANDER in CHIEF for his leadership and determination to provide for the security of our country and defend the liberty of our citizens?  There could maybe be a simple ceremony in Tallahassee, all Floridians could be encouraged to wave the flag and wear the colors, maybe local communities would do the same all on the same day. 

Just a thought.  Thanks for your time    

Regards, Lorraine Grigsby

 Dear Shelly,

Thank you for taking the time to look into my son's case.

My frustration stems from several things:

Most frustrating is the local district and local review committee have
formed their findings and opinions without reviewing or reading all data.
Not once has my son's file been requested by the local district or the LRC
in order to review. His psychiatrist has not been contacted either.  The
head of the local district has had conversations with me without even
reading the response sent back to Maximus. The LRC (which consists of one
PhD in education) states in her opinion
that all problem behavior takes place at home. If she had read the
behavioral assessment that was ordered by the
state she would have seen listed four separate behaviors, two of which
occurred at home, one at school and one at the current group home. If she
had read data from the person who investigated the group home at the local
level she would have seen several incident reports showing that my son had
been taken down using methods that were not approved and not reported until
they were investigated.  She also keeps stating that she doesn't have
enough information to make a determination. If that's the case then she
should have referred to the last behavioral assessment that was ordered by
the state last year. She did give her approval on February 4, 2003 for Kyle
to be placed in Carlton Palms with five caveats. Maximus wanted to know if
those caveats had been addressed. A response was sent back to Maximus
addressing all five caveats.  Now I'm told that the LRC wants to take their
approval away and order yet another behavioral assessment.  This is
outrageous as they have already ordered two of them. They can't keep
ordering behavioral assessments until they find one that says what they want
it to. My son has been hospitalized three times for his behavior so far in
his short life. For the LRC  not to see a behavior problem is pathetic.  I
don't think the Sheriff's office Baker Acts children for the heck of it.


 My frustration also stems from the fact that the current placement has no
idea what they are doing and are just ripping the state off. Kyle was placed
there to be rehabilitated. This group home has no trained staff, and their
CBA is a  joke (she has yet to produce a written behavioral plan and he has
been there  now 18 months). The group home gets paid over $4,000 a month to
rehabilitate my son with trained staff. To date, there is no plan in place.
We were told at a meeting with the group home in December that they have no
intentions of  having a CBA work with Kyle or with any of the other
children. They are paying their CBA to visit once a month and talk to the
staff. What is even more upsetting is that they have no understanding of
Kyle's disability. No one on staff or in management has any concept of brain
damage, of what Kyle is capable of and what is really going on with him.
They think when they hear Kyle say he is going to stab or kill his roommate
that it's normal for boys to say things like that. So they take no data
down, and rarely document any behavior. The management did admit that the
staff had not been taking any data down and that they had a meeting to talk
to them about it, still nothing has changed. There is no supervision
whatsoever. When I pick up my son the staff are watching TV while all the
boys are in their rooms with their doors shut, (two boys per room). What
kind of supervision is  that?

 I have spent the last 15 years trying to do or get whatever I could to make
my son better. Unfortunately there is no magic cure or magic pill. However
in the process I have learned a great deal about Kyle and how his brain
works and doesn't work. I know what he is capable of. When he stands at the
door with a knife to kill the pizza man because he is late with the pizza, I
know I have a problem.  When he goes to the bathroom and starts beating on
the mirror because he is hearing voices,  I know I have a problem. These are
the things my son needs help with; this is the training he needs to learn.
He needs to be placed where people with knowledge are around him 24/7 so
when they witness this behavior they can teach him how to deal with it.  He
needs to know that when he hears voices that tell him to kill me, he needs
to channel that in other ways. Or when he gets angry because I am  getting
his sister dressed that the answer is not to kill her. These are things that
every day group homes cannot do. These things require trained staff with
experience in dealing with this type of behavior. My son does
beter in structured settings and my fear is if he is not taught now how to
deal with real life situations that someday someone is going to be seriously
hurt or killed. That is a terrible fear for a mother to have about her own
son. I don't want my son to end up in prison or some mental institution for
the rest of his life. I want him trained now while he is still young enough
to learn. Kyle is smart and has so much potential,  if only someone could
channel those strengths and build up his weaknesses we would all be better
off in the long run, as opposed to reading about him in the paper someday.
It would seem to me that with all the documentation on Kyle that Maximus is
acting negligently on behalf of the state by not placing him in Carlton
Palms. The behavioral assessment done in January  recommended  it, the LRC
approved Carlton Palms on February 4th with her 5 caveats which  have
already been  addressed and responded to. Seminole County schools has
already approved the ESE money be transferred  from Seminole County to
Carlton Palms to pay for the education (this was done in December).

 Thank you for setting up a meeting next week.  In order to conduct the
thorough evaluation of Kyle's needs you mentioned, my input will be
necessary.  I plan on attending the meeting with Kyle's case manager (she
hasn't been contacted yet).  After caring for my son for the better part of
15 years, I  know him better than anyone else.

 Please read the attachments I am sending and again thank you for your time.


Sincerely,


Kim Grant

Dear Gov. Bush,

The Legislature is considering moving the Board from the Dept. of Business &
Professional Regulation
to the Dept. of Financial Services under the CFO. Many are saying DBPR is
broke and can't be fixed, I and many
others in the profession do not agree. The reengineering and technology
project is nearly complete. Licensees and consumers now
have the abiltiy to interact with the agency and the Board 24/7.  Your
vision of making state government more accountable, more accessible and more
streamlined is becoming a reality at DBPR. Presently, the Dept. of Financial
Services does not have this capability. Consumer protection related to
pre-need funeral and cemetery trust funds is important, however it does not
support the conclusion that the entire "death care industry" be regulated at
the Dept. of Financial Services.

Many in the profession feel it is illogical to transfer this Board that is
functioning well at DBPR to another agency as the nation prepares to go to
war. The Florida Dept. of Health is in the process of forming a state
emergency mortuary response team. Almost 200 funeral directors in our state
have already received training in Mass Fatalities Incidence Reponse.
Additional training is being planned. A transfer of all records, personnel,
etc. to another agency, could be disruptive.

I have met with Secretary Carr and she attended a recent Board meeting in
Tallahasse, were she pledged to work
on any remaining problems with the implementation of the reengineering
project at DBPR.

The Board understands the legislative process and I share this with you only
as a concern.

Sincerely,
Ken Roberson, Chair
State Board of Funeral Directors & Embalmers

He said that he was glad you stopped by yesterday and saw him in Tampa. I reiterated our point that with the TEA reauthorization we want to get our fair share, 95% in return for being a donor state. He understood the problem. These were his points to me: 

1. Ask Jeb to support his effort to raise the gasoline tax by 2 cents so that there will be enough revenue to increase the funding to the donor states. He needs help with convincing the WH that this is not a tax, but should be viewed as a user fee. The increase in gasoline prices is being blamed on the oil companies and the Arabs. 

2. He is sympathetic to the donor state's plight, but is afraid unless there is a bigger pie, the Senate will stall any major redistribution of the highway money. He also said that it will be likely phased in over a number of years. 

He was a delightful guy. About 70 years old... been in Congress 30 years. He is a great outdoorsman and plans to come back turkey hunting. If the transportation commission is planning any fly ins to DC this year to help with the TEA, I will be glad to assist in anyway I can.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
Our State Representative Gayle Harrell Is hosting a Veteran's Healthcare Summit on Saturday, March 22nd from 1:30 pm to 4:30 pm at the Blake Library, 2351 S.E. Monterey Road, Stuart, FL and I'm under the understanding that her office has contacted Rocky McPherson's office to have someone from his office present at this Summit, I sure hope this will be the case because there will be many Veterans at this Summit trying to get an understanding who in Florida can help them being unbiased. If this will be the case that there will be a representative from Rocky McPherson's office there, I will give him the shocking information data to bring back to you for your knowledge and consideration in helping the Veterans of Florida to get a fair shake. If he is not there, then the next best thing I can do is try to mail this information to you in hopes that you will receive it and that it is not stopped along the way to prevent you from seeing it, that is the main reason that I asked for an appointment with you there in Tallahassee.
 
Governor, I really feel bad in bringing all this on you because of the state of the Florida budget, the state of the Nation with Iraq and many problems and very busy schedules you must face and I do apologize, however, with all this, life must go on and I have dedicated the rest of my life for our Veterans and our young Military troops that will come home only to face the many problems that the past Veterans face today, I feel you are the one friend that we the Veterans here in Florida have and I do so bring that out in the many radio and TV stations presentations that I'm invited to. I will stand behind and support you as you have shown the support for the Veterans here in Florida. We certainly can work together to bring a better understanding to our Veterans. God Bless America our Military and Veterans.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I have just learned of some shocking news on how Florida Veterans are being unfairly treated here in the State of Florida. I would very much like to request a meeting with you and Rocky McPherson at your convenience at your Tallahassee office in the near future to discuss these matters with you in hopes to get these injustices resolved here if Florida.
 
Looking forward in hearing from you on getting a meeting with you at the earliest.

You will find him delightful.  I would think he could prove a great asset to
you -- an extraordinarily effective, compelling, and appealing advocate with
all the necessary credentials to be simultaneously credible and
unassailable.   Exceptionally high "q" score, as we'd say in television. 

I know, btw, that he's spoken in the past with the President, but those
conversations were confined to health care issues -- they hadn't spoken
about education when last I met with Dr. Carson.

Apologies for the delay since promising at the Hoover meeting to forward
you
material on Dr. Ben Carson (director of pediatric neurosurgery at John's
Hopkins) and his amazing Carson's Scholars Fund, which successfully
rewards
and encourages academic achievement in the poorest inner-city schools.
I
think there's potentially great synergy between your admirable education
reforms and his philanthropic efforts.

Here is the link to his website, which has a good beginning overview:
http://www.drbencarson.com.   If you want another reference for Carson,
I
suggest you check with Adam Meyerson, President of the Philanthropy
Roundtable, whom I believe you know.  Adam is a huge Carson fan and is
the
way I met him.

With all best wishes,
Heather Higgins

Dear Ms. Grant,

I can only imagine how frustrated you must feel struggling to ensure
necessary care and treatment for your son.  Please accept my most heartfelt
apology for the significant difficulties you have experienced and any
unintentional hardship the evaluation process has caused.
Clearly, your son has very special needs which must be addressed promptly
and appropriately. Please be assured you will be included in the meeting
scheduled with the district and support coordinator to determine Kyle's
placement and treatment
needs. There is no question that you know your son better than anyone and
your participation in any assessment or decision making is critical to
Kyle's success in any enviroment.

We intend to bring closure to any outstanding issues with your son's
placement needs by next week. We will also conduct a thorough investigation
of concerns you have expressed regarding his current group home placement.
Should you have any additional concerns, do not hesitate to contact me.
Very sincerely,
Shelly Brantley,
Director, Developmental Disabilities Program

Subject: Dear Governor Bush My son needs your help.

 Dear Shelly,

Thank you for taking the time to look into my son's case.

My frustration stems from several things:

Most frustrating is the local district and local review committee have
formed their findings and opinions without reviewing or reading all data.
Not once has my son's file been requested by the local district or the LRC
in order to review. His psychiatrist has not been contacted either.  The
head of the local district has had conversations with me without even
reading the response sent back to Maximus. The LRC (which consists of one
PhD in education) states in her opinion
that all problem behavior takes place at home. If she had read the
behavioral assessment that was ordered by the
state she would have seen listed four separate behaviors, two of which
occurred at home, one at school and one at the current group home. If she
had read data from the person who investigated the group home at the local
level she would have seen several incident reports showing that my son had
been taken down using methods that were not approved and not reported until
they were investigated.  She also keeps stating that she doesn't have
enough information to make a determination. If that's the case then she
should have referred to the last behavioral assessment that was ordered by
the state last year. She did give her approval on February 4, 2003 for Kyle
to be placed in Carlton Palms with five caveats. Maximus wanted to know if
those caveats had been addressed. A response was sent back to Maximus
addressing all five caveats.  Now I'm told that the LRC wants to take their
approval away and order yet another behavioral assessment.  This is
outrageous as they have already ordered two of them. They can't keep
ordering behavioral assessments until they find one that says what they
want
it to. My son has been hospitalized three times for his behavior so far in
his short life. For the LRC  not to see a behavior problem is pathetic.  I
don't think the Sheriff's office Baker Acts children for the heck of it.


 My frustration also stems from the fact that the current placement has no
idea what they are doing and are just ripping the state off. Kyle was
placed
there to be rehabilitated. This group home has no trained staff, and their
CBA is a  joke (she has yet to produce a written behavioral plan and he has
been there  now 18 months). The group home gets paid over $4,000 a month to
rehabilitate my son with trained staff. To date, there is no plan in place.
We were told at a meeting with the group home in December that they have no
intentions of  having a CBA work with Kyle or with any of the other
children. They are paying their CBA to visit once a month and talk to the
staff. What is even more upsetting is that they have no understanding of
Kyle's disability. No one on staff or in management has any concept of
brain
damage, of what Kyle is capable of and what is really going on with him.
They think when they hear Kyle say he is going to stab or kill his roommate
that it's normal for boys to say things like that. So they take no data
down, and rarely document any behavior. The management did admit that the
staff had not been taking any data down and that they had a meeting to talk
to them about it, still nothing has changed. There is no supervision
whatsoever. When I pick up my son the staff are watching TV while all the
boys are in their rooms with their doors shut, (two boys per room). What
kind of supervision is  that?

 I have spent the last 15 years trying to do or get whatever I could to
make
my son better. Unfortunately there is no magic cure or magic pill. However
in the process I have learned a great deal about Kyle and how his brain
works and doesn't work. I know what he is capable of. When he stands at the
door with a knife to kill the pizza man because he is late with the pizza,
I
know I have a problem.  When he goes to the bathroom and starts beating on
the mirror because he is hearing voices,  I know I have a problem. These
are
the things my son needs help with; this is the training he needs to learn.
He needs to be placed where people with knowledge are around him 24/7 so
when they witness this behavior they can teach him how to deal with it.  He
needs to know that when he hears voices that tell him to kill me, he needs
to channel that in other ways. Or when he gets angry because I am  getting
his sister dressed that the answer is not to kill her. These are things
that
every day group homes cannot do. These things require trained staff with
experience in dealing with this type of behavior. My son does
beter in structured settings and my fear is if he is not taught now how to
deal with real life situations that someday someone is going to be
seriously
hurt or killed. That is a terrible fear for a mother to have about her own
son. I don't want my son to end up in prison or some mental institution for
the rest of his life. I want him trained now while he is still young enough
to learn. Kyle is smart and has so much potential,  if only someone could
channel those strengths and build up his weaknesses we would all be better
off in the long run, as opposed to reading about him in the paper someday.
It would seem to me that with all the documentation on Kyle that Maximus is
acting negligently on behalf of the state by not placing him in Carlton
Palms. The behavioral assessment done in January  recommended  it, the LRC
approved Carlton Palms on February 4th with her 5 caveats which  have
already been  addressed and responded to. Seminole County schools has
already approved the ESE money be transferred  from Seminole County to
Carlton Palms to pay for the education (this was done in December).

 Thank you for setting up a meeting next week.  In order to conduct the
thorough evaluation of Kyle's needs you mentioned, my input will be
necessary.  I plan on attending the meeting with Kyle's case manager (she
hasn't been contacted yet).  After caring for my son for the better part of
15 years, I  know him better than anyone else.

 Please read the attachments I am sending and again thank you for your
time.


Sincerely,


Kim Grant

Have your staff get you a copy of the draft. Dede Schaffmer (Seminole County School Board member) is sending me a copy of it. Being a School Board member frustrated with the beauracracy and complacency I see, this could be a good thing. Keep in mind I write this with the thought of myself in that position. I really think I could have a faster broader impact on student achievement, fiscal accountability, intergovernmental relations, student mobility, teen pregnancy, and staff recruitment and retention. Unfortunately most educators see things in very narrow terms and think leadership is about position and not action. But keep in mind, I make most educators and School Board members very uncomfortable. Most people in FL public education put their organization first. I put kids, community, and taxpayers first.

It establishes an elected School Board Chmn in Counties with appointed Superintendents. This is basically modeled after the Orange County form of govt where Mel Martinez was Chmn and Rich Crotty currently is. The School Chmn would be the CEO and be paid four times that of other School Board members. The position would obviously be elected County Wide and serve 4 years per term. Some have said it may be unconstitutional, I don't know enough about the law to know if that is or is not true. Now based on this info. what do you think ?

No sweat. By the way as much as it kills me to admit it ( he is a Democrat ). Keep your eye on newly elected Orange County School Board member Tim Shea. He's a sharp guy. Since getting elected it has been very disheartening to see the lack of depth and energy most School Board members have. When I come accross a bright person capable of creativity and independent thought as it relates to leadership and govt. THey stick out like a sore thimb. A couple of other bright newly elected School Board members are Steve Donovan in Collier and Marty Rubinstein in Broward (another "D"). By the way what do you think of Andy Gardiners proposed bill to create a STRONG elected School Board Chmn ?

Try an old test, it is a real eye opener. The real way to improve scores is through curbing mobility. County's with fewer rentals do better on the test. The catch is getting families in a home of their own that can generate enough in taxes to pay for all the municipal services expected. Also to improve our economic development outlook we need to change how we tackle the SAT. Firms outside of FL have no clue about FCAT, but they all know the SAT.Example: In Osceola we test 57% of our kids on the SAT, yet fewer than 30% go to college-resulting in horrid scores. So we need to target the matriculating student population and provide a test prep course/strategy, thus increasing scores and giving the economic development community a more usable product. Fortunately the business community in Osceola has agreed to fund the test prep course. Conversely for those students not going to college we need to do a better job with career training. Since being sworn in I find many people clinging to the status quo and seeing me as a threat. I have a Superintendent that in four years has never fired a Principal, and Board members who are totally enamored with staff. At least you have the luxury of being the CEO. My resolve and commitment will serve me and my constituents well in the next four years. I will be sending you data soon on a facility solution/option for the class size amendment. JW

Seniors trim taxes with school duty
A program catching on in the suburbs of Phila. offers credits of up to $500.
By Dan Hardy

When Patricia Matyasovsky retired as a nurse-anesthetist at a Pottstown hospital in the late 1980s, she and her husband thought they had the good life nailed - right down to winters in Florida, where they bought a second home.

They had enjoyed barely a decade of it, when in February 2002, Joseph Matyasovsky died of cancer. The widow sold their Florida house, but with only her pension and Social Security as income, she faced the prospect of also giving up her home in Pottstown, which has the highest property tax rate in Montgomery County. How could she pay a bill that topped $2,800, and was bound to keep going up?

The Pottstown School District had a novel answer: Matyasovsky could work part of it off.

In a nine-year-old program that is catching on with other districts in the Philadelphia suburbs, senior citizens can earn as much as $500 in real estate tax credits by spending up to 100 hours annually helping out in the schools. This year, 86 Pottstown residents are in the Golden Sage project, serving typically as reading assistants, classroom aides or clerical workers.

Matyasovsky (who gives her age only as "old enough to be in this program") started out copying old school records onto microfiche. She has since graduated to an administrative position, putting in five hours a week matching Golden Sage applicants to assignments.

Her sister, Gloria Wisloski, a retired postal employee, also is in Golden Sage. "I used to work for $20 an hour," she noted tartly. "Now I'm getting less than minimum wage."

Still - in a state with a property tax system long decried for punishing the elderly - it often comes down to this: "I want to keep my home," Matyasovsky said of her small Cape Cod, assessed at $83,470. "This is helping me do that."

That sense of relief, rather than resentment, runs strong among nearly 200 seniors working in similar rebate programs begun by three other districts in the region: Coatesville, Great Valley and West Chester Area, all in Chester County. They will be joined this month by yet another Chester County district, Avon Grove, where more than 30 seniors have signed up.

A handful of other programs can be found in the state, including at least three in Berks County. But elsewhere in the nation, they are rare; New Jersey has none, according to the state School Boards Association.

There are reasons why the work-for-rebates concept would have particular appeal in Pennsylvania. One is an extraordinarily large proportion of senior citizens, second only to Florida. People older than age 62 make up 18.1 percent of the state population, and 16.2 percent in Philadelphia and the four suburban counties.

On those graying legions, overlay the property tax system, the main funding source for education. Because it is pegged to real estate values, not ability to pay, the tax has been an onerous burden for homeowners on fixed incomes, primarily the elderly. Since 1990, the average school real estate tax rate in the state has shot up 80 percent.

"We hear a lot of people saying they have to give up their house and move into a smaller house or a different community," said Ray Landis, spokesman for AARP Pennsylvania. "They say, 'With these high taxes, it's not working out.' "

While advocates for the elderly have applauded the rebates, advocates of tax reform see the program as a symptom of a badly flawed system.

"It's a sad situation where we have to create ways for people to be able to pay their real estate taxes," said Wallace Nunn, a Pennsylvania School Board of Education member who has urged that the local property tax be largely replaced with higher state taxes.

In the last year, state lawmakers' search for an equitable way to fund education has picked up steam - so far without result.

That leaves rebate programs as the most palatable solution for some seniors. There is no income maximum, and applicants must submit only to a criminal background check and a tuberculosis test. The minimum qualifying age ranges from 55 to 62.

Most programs grant up to $500 in credits, with West Chester at a high of $560. An hour of work is worth from $5 (Pottstown and Coatesville) to $10 (Avon Grove and Great Valley).

"We started out offering $5," said Sandra Claus, volunteer coordinator for Great Valley. "But we got very little interest."

Last year in the Pottstown, Great Valley, West Chester and Coatesville programs combined, $88,400 in tax credits were paid out - a modest sum, the districts say. Yet to avoid losing too much revenue, or shifting an undue burden onto younger taxpayers, they have set spending limits.

In the 3,400-student Pottstown school system, with a $37 million budget, Golden Sage costs about $50,000 a year.

"It's money well-spent," said Superintendent Anthony Georeno. "It's a small, small token of relief for senior citizens in a situation where there is no other way of granting relief."

The districts say they are getting something valuable in return: part-time help, alleviating the need for a larger workforce. Given the programs' small scale so far, they have not raised the hackles of the Pennsylvania State Education Association, the union representing most school district employees.

"As far as we're concerned, we can't get enough of having people help out in the classroom," said Bonnie McCarthy, a PSEA spokeswoman. "As long as they're not doing someone else's job, it's all right with us."

In a Pottstown school, one woman plays piano in music classes; another sells cafeteria tickets. In West Chester, Bill Holtz, 80, a retired newspaper composing room supervisor, cooks food for nutrition classes.

But few are as busy as Larry Williams, 85, of East Goshen.

In the year since the West Chester program began, he served briefly as a building entrance monitor at Peirce Middle School, and used his former job skills as an architectural photographer to figure out the lighting for the television studio.

He has graded multiple-choice tests, compiled answers to a student survey, scanned books into the library computer, built shelves and a coat rack, repaired dozens of chairs, and packed away about 100 computers for the summer.

Although he and his wife live in an upscale development, he said, they depend solely on Social Security and investments - and "the last couple of years have been difficult for those investments."

So the prospect of getting a cut in his $2,500 school tax bill "caught my attention," he said.

Williams earned the maximum credits in 56 hours. But last year he put in about 150 hours, nearly two-thirds given free because, he said, "the environment is delightful."

At Pottstown's Franklin Elementary School, principal Mia DiPaolo noted that the senior citizens fill shoes for "a lot of our students [who] don't have grandparents around." One Golden Sager makes certificates for the children's birthdays - "the kind of special touch I wouldn't have the time to do without her," she said.

Also at Franklin, helping in the computer lab, is none other than Pottstown's mayor. A retired telephone company administrator, Anne Jones said she and her husband are "not poor - we could pay our taxes without this." She joined Golden Sage because of "the kids." "If you just want to make money," she said, "you could go to McDonald's" to work.

For $5 an hour, the schools are "getting a real break," said fellow Golden Sager Gloria Wisloski. They are "getting good help for that kind of money."

From:  Ronald V. Regan, sr.  (The Old Sarge)
 
As public affairs officer for the "Veteran's Voting Block" - (the VVB) here in State of Florida, I would like to send you a copy of a recent broadcast of my "Veteran's Cafe" radio program. It is a topic you should be made aware.  
 
I have also informed Ginnie Brown-Waite of the internal problems with national and regional VA offices.  She is most interested as she is now a member of the House Veterans Committee in Congress. Her knowledge of national and regional veterans affairs is minimal.  I hope my input will educate her too. 
 
Anyway, my guest was Mr. Arthur Bernklau. He is the President of the "Veterans for Constitutional Law, Ltd." and his office is 112 Jefferson Ave.   Port Jefferson, New York  11777.
 
Phone # (631) 474 - 4261.......
 
He is an author, columnist and a man whose chosen duty (as a disabled American veteran) is to expose his findings concerning the fraudulent and dispicable internal operations of the national and regional Departments of Veterans Affairs.
 
If you ever want to be rocked back on your heels, then I suggest that you consider listening to this one 30 minute radio program from the audio files of "Veteran's Cafe." 
 
Please send me your official address, or where ever you would like me to send this audio tape.
 
I must also inform you that neither I nor Mr. Bernklau are anti- VA.  We both applaud the hard working 'grunts' who do wonderful and conscientious work at the VA health care centers and clinics nation wide despite the reprehensible acts being performed at the mid and high levels of the Dept of VA.
 
This is especially true here at the Clearwater, Florida,  Regional VA Center.   Also the secret and underhanded operations exposed in Atlanta, Ga. in 2000.  Those folks finally were prosecuted in 2003.... great story.   And Alabama seems to be the next den of thieves that will be exposed.
 
SO, far I have had no word of problems within the Florida Dept. of Veteran Affairs.  Jeff Edwards has also been a guest on my radio program and he informs me that you have taken the VVB pledge.  Has Rocky McPherson done so ?  His integrity has so far been exceptional.
 
Well, I wish you and your family the protection of what the Lord can provide for all us on a daily basis. God bless Florida and America !

Jeb:

 

My e-mail seem to be back.

 

I wish that you could give me your advise on the issue presented below, but I understand if you can't.  The least that we need is more challenges than the ones we already have.  Unfortunately each step we take seems to be accompanied with enforceable new ones.  You know that ESE due process is a personal experience that we been having since last summer, and one that we do not wish any parent to endure.  It doesn't seem that DOE understands that the system needs to be less legal, and simpler for parents to be able to have access to it.  I sense that we are going through some motions that are not going to change anything. I even question why spend energy when we are not going to be heard.  I know that you understand, but have to delegate to those that have the responsibility.

 

I am sure that God will guide us.  Gracias Jeb!

Lilly:

I too wish very much that both Laura and you have been included in next week's meeting. We can't take things personal, as it's not about us, but about our kids and others.  

I do not believe that this should be a cause to divide us.  We are here for many years to come, and we have many things that we need to do together.  Most, if not all of the others that will attend the meeting will leave long before any of us do.  

I tried to have all of us and even others present.  After realizing that our representation was going to be limited to three of us, I thought about canceling the meeting, but after hearing from some of you, I decided against it. It's important to keep communication open for possible future talk.  We may not be able to do what the 5 of us can do, but we can do a little more than if none of us are there.   Maybe I shouldn't have started the discussion to begin with, but it's too late to undue what is done, but we still have time to cancel the meeting, which may still be the best to do.  One thing that I do not want to happen is to fly to Tallahassee to find ourselves in a confrontational situation which unfortunately will not move the cause forward.  It's not easy for any of us to fly to Tallahassee, and for sure for both, Milton and I at the same time.  Lilly, please let us do what we can, with the tools that we have.  Thank you.



Dear Berthy,

Thank you for your e-mail.  You are right in that we cannot take things personally and that it is not about us, but about the kids and others.  If it were not because I think that I have something valuable to offer on behalf of kids and others, I will not be wasting my time trying to influence the proposed ESE Rules.  After all, I was the one who wrote to Governor Jeb Bush initially regarding the undermining of rights for parents and children under the proposed ESE Rules.  I am not the one who is taking this personally.  I think Shan Goff is the one who is taking this personally and I see the actions of FL DOE against my work on behalf of children and families as a pattern of retaliation - this being only one of those instances.  No one has yet told me the reason why Laura Prado and I cannot attend this meeting. As a matter of fact, no one from FL DOE has yet told me that I am not invited to this meeting.  State agencies in Florida must conduct their business under the Sunshine Law and I think that according to the frequently asked questions regarding what meetings are covered under the Sunshine Law, this meeting may be covered:     

Q. What qualifies as a meeting? 
A. The Sunshine law applies to all discussions or deliberations as well as the formal action taken by a board or commission. The law, in essence, is applicable to any gathering, whether formal or casual, of two or more members of the same board or commission to discuss some matter on which foreseeable action will be taken by the public board or commission. There is no requirement that a quorum be present for a meeting to be covered under the law. 

Q. Can a public agency hold closed meetings? 
A. There are a limited number of exemptions which would allow a public agency to close a meeting. These include, but are not limited to, certain discussions with the board's attorney over pending litigation and portions of collective bargaining sessions. In addition, specific portions of meetings of some agencies (usually state agencies) may be closed when those agencies are making probable cause determinations or considering confidential records. 

The last thing that I want to do is to "find ourselves in a confrontational situation," and that is the reason why I have written to Shan Goff and to Daniel Woodring and have advised them that I will be attending.  They have not yet told me that I am not invited to attend. I think I have a right to exercise my rights to participation.  I know this must be very difficult for you.  However, I am convinced that FL DOE  is attempting to divide and conquer and it is up to us to stay united or to give in to the capricious and retaliatory demands of FL DOE.  They are probably hoping that you do cancel the meeting so that they can then turn around and tell Jeb that they were willing to meet and listen to the concerns, but that you canceled the follow-up meeting.  I don't think that would be too wise.  That would be playing right into their hands.

I have not yet been given any legitimate reason why FL DOE does not want Laura and I there, especially in light of the fact that I will be in Tallahassee on Friday and my presence at the meeting will not cost the State to incur any additional expenses.  Honesty is very important to me and I have no reason to think that you are not honest with me. Therefore, I am assuming that no one has given you any legitimate reason either.  I have kept you fully informed of all my communications and will continue to do so.  Berthy, we have been friends for a long, long time and I value our friendship and don't want to hurt it in any way.  Please don't ask me not to be myself, not to have self-determination and courage, and not to be assertive, and not to follow what I think God wants from me.  As I think you know, I don't play political games.  Because I don't succumb to pressure is the only reason why I have outlived other advocates in Miami-Dade County.  This is a very hard and difficult job but it must be done.

Thank you and God bless,

Lilly

Shan:

 

I will appreciate that you send us copy of the latest version of the draft procedural safeguards rule so that we have time to review them before we meet.

 

Even though I think it will be a good idea to have an ALJ involved in a discussion of reviewing the draft rules, I can understand your suggestion to not include them at this time. I can also understand keeping the group small, but do not understand why we can’t include 2 additional people.  I also do not feel that the composition of the invitees has sufficient parental representation.  The list of invitees even resembles the composition of an IEP team meeting.  

 

To have a meaningful meeting, I believe that it's necessary that there is equal parental representation in the discussion.  To have 6 to 8 school board staff (3 named in your list, 2 others TBA, you, Daniel, and Kim), one city attorney (in your list), and only one family (Milton and I) and one parent attorney (Michael Boswell), doesn't seem that will generate the needed input to make meaningful and balanced recommendations.  

 

For that reason, I respectfully request that you reconsider at least adding the other two parents (Lilly & Laura Prado) that attended the initial meeting with Daniel and Kim.  To keep the group small, only either Milton or I will attend.  That will only add one additional person to the group, including the other two parents that we recommend.

 

On the date, Friday afternoon (1 -5 pm), will probably work better for us.

 

Thanks for your help and understanding.

Berthy,

 

Sorry it has taken me a few days to respond.  I think that the list of invitees is as was sent - but I did not list you and Milton as I was sending the email to you.  It would not be appropriate for us to invite an ALJ as this time, but we will have opportunities to assist in providing them information on the "new" rules.  We can relook at the days in March - but it may be "iffy" given the beginning of the legislative session.  It would have to be the 20th or 21st for me.  Do you want me to go ahead and check with Daniel and Kim on the new days? 

 

Hope Lucy';s procedure goes well!

As I understand by your e-mail, FDOE has invited six individuals in addition to yourself, Kim McDougal, and Daniel Woodring, and that you will also include and reimburse travel expenses for other participants to the stakeholders meeting. 

 

Since when Kim McDougal, and Daniel Woodring met with Laura Prado, Michael Boswell, Lilly Diaz, Milton and myself, they agreed to have another meeting, I assume that they are part of the stakeholders group, and that FDOE will reimburse for their travel expenses.  In addition, I suggest that you invite an ALJ.

 

I also want to ask you if it's possible to reschedule the meeting date.  Since we last talked Lucy was scheduled for a medical procedure just a few days before. I am not sure how well she will be for us to leave her.  Additionally a couple of the participants have commitments that are hard to rescheduled.  If it works for the rest, since DD day is scheduled in Tallahassee for March 19th or 20th, March 20th or 21th seem to work better for most.  I apologize for the inconvenience.

I have a few ideas that I will be sending for her consideration.  I want to suggest to you that you may want to consider adding your annual CAFE town hall meeting conference to the plan, and have Lori Fahey be the "Director" outlined in Shelly's plan.  This, I think will bring resources together in the most efficient matter.  If you still wish to keep the two (FCC, CAFE Inc.) separate, please, please, please... make sure that CAFE Inc. board of director's has a majority representation of FCC members that understand the vision of the "system of the future".

Berthy,

Thank you so much for your feedback. I added the very important self determination confirmation principle. I will also try to confirm the percent of individuals with cognitive disabilities who are unemployed, but I believe your 96%  estimate is correct (unfortunately).  I have also added some unemployment figures from the US Bureau of the Census 1997 survey
which indicated the unemployment rate of working age adults with disabilities is 70 percent. Nationally the unemployment rate for all working age adults is just over 5%. Only 26 percent of working age adults with significant disabilities have a job or a business compared to 82
percent of those without significant disabilities. Among workers with college degree, only 52 percent of those with severe disabilities report labor market activity compared to 90 percent of those with no disability-a gap of 38 percentage points. . The National Organization on Disability (NOD) recently released , The State of the State Union 2002 for Americans with Disabilities." The report details the findings of a comprehensive 2001 NOD Harris Poll, which surveyed Americans with disabilities on their opinions of major life activities. The poll found that employment is the largest gap area, with 32 percent of people with disabilities working full
or part time, compared to 81 percent of the rest of the population.

DOE and VR play a major role in our success to change history, especially since federal law requires Medicaid to be the payor of last resort. The DS waiver cannot afford to pick up the slack when other parties fail to comply with their responsibilities. Ideally, we could cash out those revenues as well and let self advocates decide how best utilize these public funds for
the purposes of their own employment planning.

I have attached the FCC proposal. I don't know why this didn't attach correctly the first time, but let me know if you have trouble opening it. This is a draft so please let me know if you have any suggestions or concerns.

Shelly:

This is excellent!  I love it, and I hope that the Governor agrees with it!
A few minor comments, there are now 5 principles of self determination.
The last one is the principle of "confirmation"; people with disabilities
are involved in the advocacy and policy making of issues that affect their
lives. i.e. System redesign.  I think that the unemployment rate of people
with cognitive disabilities it's about 96%. Society has NO EXPECTATIONS of
what they can do, and unfortunately it starts with the school and it's
perpetuated by everything else.  The Governor and DCF needs to make sure
that FDOE change their paradigm. Special Education and VR is not helping

Developmental Disabilities Program



Common System Barriers for Individuals with Disabilities

Current disability benefits, employment, and welfare programs interact in
complex ways that often discourage beneficiaries from seeking employment
and increased earnings. People with disabilities who wish to work often
fear they will be forced to choose between giving up benefits and supports
and their efforts to achieve independence through earnings. Individuals
must navigate highly complex policies and procedures with the programs
they
currently access, and the programs they could potentially access, to
determine a plan of action that leads to greater independence.

People with disabilities, family members and advocates often find it
difficult to make confident informed choices about benefit options and
employment goals when faced with these complexities. Additionally, despite
recent reform legislation, including the Ticket to Work and Work Incentive
Act of 1999, there continues to be "incentive incompatibilities" that
serve
as barriers not only to the employment of individuals but also to the
efforts of policy makers to improve the policies and remove the
disincentives. For example, people with disabilities must demonstrate how
they are unable to work because of their disability in order to be
eligible
for SSA benefits, but once determined eligible they are encouraged to use
work incentives to achieve earnings (Social Security Handbook 2001).
People
with disabilities rightfully fear that working might demonstrate work
potential that could threaten their continued eligibility.

A major source of "incentive incompatibility" results from the fact that
both eligibility and benefit levels for many government benefits are tied
to earning levels. Programs such as housing/rent supplements, Supplemental
Security Income (SSI), Medicaid, Medicare, Food Stamps, and TANF
(Temporary
Assistance to Needy Families) are characterized by benefits that either
disappear or are reduced when a beneficiary's earnings rise. The
reasonable
fears people with disabilities have of losing disability-related benefits
as a result of earnings, is a very real factor in maintaining their
traditionally high unemployment levels.

Almost 75% of people with disabilities remain unemployed in an economy
that
has experienced growth in employment opportunities for all workers.
Current
weakness in the economy is likely to drive the percentage of people with
disabilities who are unemployed even higher. Of those people with
disabilities who do work, the number of hours and employment opportunities
are significantly constricted by program eligibility guidelines, income
limitations, asset limitations, and other complex human service program
interactions. The evidence that nearly all individuals with disabilities
could work, if support and environmental changes are provided, has not led
to the increases in employment that should have been achieved in the last
decade. (Nerney, 1998).

The US Bureau of the Census 1997 survey which indicated the unemployment
rate of working age adults with disabilities is 70 percent. Nationally
the unemployment rate for all working age adults is just over 5%. Only 26
percent
of working age adults with significant disabilities have a job or a
business compared
to 82 percent of those without significant disabilities. Among workers
with college degree,
only 52 percent of those with severe disabilities report labor market
activity
compared to 90 percent of those with no disability-a gap of 38 percentage
points.

The National Organization on Disability (NOD) recently released , The
State of
the State Union 2002 for Americans with Disabilities." The report details
the findings
of a comprehensive 2001 NOD Harris Poll, which surveyed Americans with
disabilities on their opinions of major life activities. The poll found
that employment
is the largest gap area, with 32 percent of people with disabilities
working full
  or part time, compared to 81 percent of the rest of the population.

Self Determination

The complex array of Medicaid and welfare policy regulations often work
against achieving real self-determination for persons with disabilities, a
principle central to the goal of inclusion, informed choice and economic
and social sufficiency of people who have disabilities. Self-Determination
addresses the limited freedom of choice and independent action often
experienced by individuals with disabilities in the present health and
human services system. Self determination is dependent on five basic
principles: freedom to develop a personal life plan, authority to control
a
targeted sum of resources, support to obtain personal goals,
responsibility
for contributing to one's community and using public dollars
wisely, and confirmation of the important leadership role that self
advocates
must play in a newly re-designed system and support for self advocacy
movement. Principles of self-determination establish that people with
disabilities are the planners and decision-makers in all daily living
activities, such as working and taking financial control of service
resources and personal income. Unfortunately, these principles will be
hard
to achieve without significant reforms to the current state and federally
funded health and human services system.

System Reform Recommendation

We must directly address the systemic problems inherit to both the
SSI/SSDI
(Supplemental Security Disability Income) program and Medicaid which
present significant barriers for individuals with disabilities seeking
employment, typical housing opportunities and other ordinary freedoms
associated with American citizenship. As Governor of the State of Florida,
I would like to recommend piloting a "system of the future" which draws on
our unique experience with consumer directed care and current efforts to
expand choice, freedom and responsibility through the new Independence
Plus
Medicaid 1115 waiver authority. This recommendation will allow more State
flexibility and authority over the current SSI/SSDI program as well as
Medicaid to achieve a more cost-effective system of supports for
individuals with disabilities without disincentives to work and barriers
to
independent living. (Please see Attachment A and B for a summary of
Florida's Consumer Directed Care Waiver Project and Independence Plus
Waiver Amendment Proposal.)

Florida's Freedom Initiative: The System of the Future

Purpose:

§     The primary purpose of the proposed Florida Freedom Initiative is to
demonstrate that when current ceilings on income and asset limitations are
raised, and Medicaid funds can be used with greater flexibility,
individuals with disabilities will overcome resistance to earning money
privately, take their place as ordinary citizens and resolve housing and
transportation problems more efficiently.

§     The second purpose is to demonstrate more cost efficiency in the use
of public funds.

Objective:

§     The overall objective in conducting this system reform effort is to
demonstrate whether providing additional work incentives under the SSI
program will remove potential and real barriers to work for recipients of
SSI benefits based on ongoing developmental disability. Under this new
waiver program we can test whether altering certain SSI program rules
provides effective work incentives for SSI recipients and concurrent
SSI/SSDI beneficiaries to attempt to work for the first time, return to
work or increase their work hours and income.

§     The second objective is to determine whether individuals who might
not otherwise work and produce income can contribute to some of the costs
of long term care as well as modestly increase their own earned income.

Goals:

§     Securing broad waiver authority under Medicaid and the Social
Security Administration to allow those enrolled in the new Florida Freedom
Initiative to increase their income and assets.

§     Allow individuals to enroll in the new Florida Freedom Initiative to
encourage creative approaches to housing, work and meaningful lives.

§     Develop and implement an evaluation of the new Florida Freedom
Initiative system to determine cost effectiveness of the increased
flexibility and reduction of disincentives to work while increasing
opportunities to control transportation and achieve affordable housing.

§     Develop and implement a statewide training effort to maximize the
effectiveness of using broad Medicaid and Social Security Administration
waiver authority simultaneously.

§     Design, develop and implement system reform for individuals with
developmental disabilities that is cost effective, promotes the principles
of self-determination and can be replicated across all disability
populations.

Necessary Waiver Authority to Implement Change:

Florida has already participated in the most comprehensive demonstration
of
consumer directed care including children and adults with developmental
disabilities, aged and disabled adults, and adults with Traumatic Brain
Injury and Spinal Cord Injury. Broad Medicaid waiver authority and some
waivers of SSA income and asset requirements already exist for consumer
directed care and have been successfully tested. Florida can combine
Medicaid 1115 waiver authority through our Independence Plus waiver
proposal (submitted December 12, 2003) with additional waiver authority
from the Social Security Administration to accent those issues most
problematic for individuals with disabilities.

§     Waive prohibition on room and board in order to make typical housing
more available to individuals with developmental disabilities.

§     Waive the prohibition on purchasing of transportation including
those
individuals who cannot drive but need to control the means of
transportation to live meaningful lives.

§     Waive any exclusion to pay employers directly for co-worker support,
training costs, transportation or temporary wage supplementation.

§     Waive all prohibitions on qualified Medicaid providers except where
appropriate for normal criminal and other background checks. Allow
individuals to contract with faith-based groups as well.

§     Waive any real or perceived prohibitions on allowing individuals to
capitalize very small micro enterprises up to $1500 annually.

It is important to note broad Medicaid waiver authority already exists in
Florida's current Consumer Directed Care Waiver and will be further
expanded once we obtain federal approval for our new Independence Plus
waiver amendment which includes the option to "cash out" certain Medicaid
state plan services.  However, there is still a prohibition on room and
board payments and the purchase of certain types of transportation under
the current Medicaid authority.

Conclusion: A Vision for the Future

Florida's proposed strategy for system reform is consistent with the
intent
of inclusion and person directed support for individuals with
disabilities.
The mere use of publicly funded programs is not the point. The States in
collaboration with the Federal government need a innovative, revolutionary
and highly discretionary health and human service system to reduce
bureaucracy, maximize public funds, natural supports and support real
choice and empowerment for persons with disabilities. The founders of our
nation conceived of a community of liberty, justice and equality. This
nation was designed so that each citizen could contribute to the common
good and therefore have a say in the destiny of the community. After more
than 200 years, that vision is the corner stone of the community we are
still in the process of creating.

Gov Bush 

I was in the capital today as a participant in the supportive housing strategic planning workgroup when I learned that a 28 year employee of the DCF - Mental Health Program Office had been dismissed for what I am sure you would agree was a minor and honest mistake.  This person's name is VINCE SMITH, I grew to respect Vince's knowledge and understanding of the technical side of the system, but also to advocate for what was right for consumers.  It would appear that if you as a state employee support the Gov on issues at a mid level management position you are quckly targeted for removal and replacement by those that will continue the effort to undermine your bold plans to reshape government, partricularly at DCF.  Vince is a republican and those that sought his removal from DCF were democrats, I have had other friends that are republicans that work in mid level positions that have either been forced out or left because the climate was unbearable.  I believe this is wrond, it is shameful for people to be terminating state employees with good records on issues that I would describe as anal retentive at best.  I think there should be a stop placed on the democrats from routing good republoicans from service to their state, I am not aware of how this dynamic plays out in other state agencies, but have my fiull when it comes to DCF.  I asked Vince if it was OK to give you his home number and he said yes, he supports his party, his gov and our president 850-385-8208.  I think Vince would be a valuable asset to you and help you identify where all the problems lie in the unside down world of mental health and politics........if what I have heard is true, truly you have lost a good employee because of political issues, this should be stopped.  I felt it was my duty to at least make you aware of the incident.  Thanks again for your honesty and continued leadership we appreciate it more than you know here in Nassau County, Florida.

Dear Governor Bush:

It was with a great deal of sadness that I recently learned of the Bay County Property Appraiser's death.

During the last campaign, I had the privilege of helping a fine young man who is a Republican and ran for the office. His name is Rick Barnett.

I am originally from Bay County and most of my family lives in Bay County. Mr. Barnett has been a real estate broker for many years. He is from a prominent family in Bay County and  is a true Republican.

I heard that one of Mr. Davies deputies recently (a year ago) switched parties in hopes of receiving an appointment when Mr. Davies passed away.

I hope that you will give serious consideration to appointing Mr. Barnett. He is a true Republican who will clean that office up. Mr. Barnett's appointment could be the very thing that we need to begin a total switch from Democrat to Republican elected officials in Bay County during the next election.

Jeb,
I see where the state is struggling with the budget and coming up way short on money. It is regretable but I deal with it all of the time. There are numerous things I want but no money for them.
My family has to do without things because of money restraints and so will the state. If there is not enough money, there is no answer except to go with you have. 
If some programs are to be cut, so be it. I take care of myself and my family. Why should I be expected to support anyone else?
I will say this state doesn't need high speed rail, once again why should I pay for something I'd never use? Class size? The class sizes are the same as when I was in school. More classrooms are not the answer, we don't have enough teachers the way it is.

In it's resolution - see below and at  <http://www.ccfj.net/taskforceLULAC.html> http://www.ccfj.net/taskforceLULAC.html - LULAC requests immediate action by the Florida Legislature.
 
CCFJ Condo Committee chairman Humberto Sanchez, a LULAC council man, proposed this solution after researching many of the complaints by home- and unit-owners about association abuses.
 
The Mandated Property Reform Task Force bill - SB 1248 and HB 547 - is waiting for committee hearings!
 
The many horror stories from all over Florida call for immediate action by our legislature. Home- and unit-owners from all over Florida ask for help in Tallahassee to put a stop to all these abuses.
 
We are asking our legislators to support these bills by adding their names as co-sponsors and make sure that the Task Force will be formed and hold its organizational meeting by August 1, 2003 as planned.
Please help to pass this consumer-friendly bill! 
 
Warm regards

Dear Governor Bush:

My mother, Georgina, suggested that I contact you after she met you at the Coral Gables Publix yesterday.  I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you, but she is desperate.  She is 77 years old and is attempting to help my daughter and me with her retirement money.   

As mom explained, I have been out of a full time job since May 2002.  I have attempted to work on my own, but that is almost impossible when I did not leave with any files.  I worked at my firm for 9 1/2 years, but was let go when they decided they needed to downsize.  Since then, I have applied to approximately 2 jobs per week.  I have only received rejections or no responses.  Please know that after being let go by my firm, I decided that I would not go back to doing civil litigation ( I have attached my resume for your review).

Currently, I have applied to 3 positions which are of most interest to me.  I applied for the position of Assistant General Counsel at both FIU and UM.  I have also applied for a teaching position at the School of Law at FIU.  Unfortunately, I have heard nothing from either school regarding any of these jobs.  

I truly hope and pray (along with my mother, father, and daughter) that you can help me in some way.  I pride myself at being a hard worker and an extremely loyal employee.  All I need is a chance to prove myself.  I know my department will be thrilled with my work ethic.

I want to thank you for your time and consideration.  My prayers are with you and your family during these troubling times.

Sincerely,

Lourdes Alfonsin Ruiz

Subject:	Teacher certification

Dear Governor Bush,
My name is Raymond Garrison. About two years ago I applied to the state for a three year temporary teaching certificate.  I sent in a check for $56.00 with my transcripts and application and never heard back.  Occasionally I checked in with the local school board office in Indian River only to be told that the application was pending.  Since that time I have found employment within the Boy Scouts of America.  My desire to teach still exists and I have recently submitted an online application.  The part I have a problem with though is that this state needs more teachers than ever and here I am willing to enter a noble profession but two years later I have nothing to show for it.  My check for 56.00 was cashed. I have tried on numerous occasions to call the 800 number but have yet to get through.  I am eager and willing to begin teaching middle school in Palm Beach Florida this upcoming year and would appreciate any assistance in finding out whatever happened to my original application, and if it was ever approved.  
Thank you for your time and help in this matter. If it helps to track my file my social security number is [REDACTED].  My home number is       772-713-9573. My many thanks to you and your staff from a loyal party member.

I do not wish to do the states job in this matter; myself and others have met with FDLE.

 

We have already been contacted by the media and were successful at diverting their interest at this time, however, when they decide to pursue this story in the future, and they have said (They Will), I will again notify them I have brought this to your attention from the beginning. Our public relations counselor has asked me to let you know of this, so you can be prepared for media inquiries.

Subject:	FW: Pfizer/House Comm Bill on Value Added Programs

fyi

Points:
1- the decision to continue or discontinue the value-added program should be a business decision, not a legislated one
2- rebates do save funds in the short term.  Level of those savings per pharmaceutical manufacturer will change as their market share changes- a reflection of their 
    success in competing through rebate negotiations.
3- a combination of rebates and value-added programs allows for both short term savings and long term invest in a reduction of long term costs through improved 
    health outcomes

Plan:
Assuming the CMS-Pfizer issue is settled, we plan to negotiate in the new contract  our approach to addressing the increased market share Pfizer, etc are enjoying by: 
-(1) increasing the amount ot the required quaranteed savings
-(2) limiting the number of their drugs to be included in our PDL under these programs.  Their remaining drugs will have to be rebate.

Additional Considerations:
- 80,000 people are now in some way receiving services from this program
- 10 safety net hospitals have invested in this program and are hopeful the resources this program provides for Medicaid beneficiaries will continue
- program is being watched nationally as a model

Subject: Pfizer/House Comm Bill


Re: Pharm Company Value Added Programs

Rep Farkas/House Health Comm has a Medicaid bill the proposes value added programs be discontinued. Basis for this proposal: recent OPAGGA report stating that for the Pfizer program an additonal $64 million would have been saved if rebates had been used instead.

Last year (before the value added program started) Pfizer's market share of Medicaid pharmacy expenditures was $33 million -the amount they later agreed to quarantee us

This year with Pfizer in the value added agreement -all their drugs are included on the PDL, they dominate several major classifications of drugs, and their market share of Medicaid pharmacy spending has dramatically increased.

If we stopped the value added program and required Pfizer to negotiate rebates like other companies and compete for drug categories, their market share would decline back down.

We think the option proposed to stop the value added program now in the hopes of catching some additional savings in the short time it will take for Pfizer's market share to drop back down to baseline may not be worth it.

It may be better for us to continue the value added program but require in the new contract with Pfizer (1) significantly larger quaranteed savings and/or (2) limit the number of their drugs included in the PDL under this agreement and have the rest of their product line be subject to rebate agreements.

Would also like to continue value added because of the work it is doing for the beneficiaries and the support/resources it is providing to safety net hospital community.

Farkas bill will be heard in Committee tomorrow. Need you thoughts on this asap.

Dear Jebb,


	With the activation of many Reserve and National Guard units, the states
professional
workforce is going to be strained. I would like to make a suggestion.

	As a retired Engineer, I would like to help fill one of these voids.
Department of
Transportation, Department of Environmental Protection or Emergency Management
comes to
mind first. I would be able to work on a temporary basis while these engineers
and managers are
on active duty with little “ramp-up” time required. This would reduce the
domino effect of
moving the current employees to cover the vacated positions. 

	I am a Florida registered Professional Engineer with more than 35 years of
experience. 30
plus with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 3 and a half years County
Engineer/Public Works
Director for Walton and Washington Counties, as well as consulting on road
projects in Africa.  

	Please give this some thought, for we all need to pull together during these
dangerous
times. 


	Respectfully yours,

Subject:	Economic Development in Tallahassee

Dear Governor Bush,

I just read your two most recent electronic newsletters.  I am most distressed over the dismantling of Florida's State Library housed here in Tallahassee.  I understand that it is the "circulating collection" that you are proposing to move, but that does not change my opposition.

I was raised in a suburb of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.  I spent many hours in the State Library while working on my bachelor's and master's degrees.  It was the most complete collection of information located under one roof and I felt fortunate to have access to it.  Recently, I was driving my 15-year-old daughter around Harrisburg's Capitol complex. As we passed the state library, I promised to take her there one day.  An avid reader, she has an affinity for books and there is no more complete collection of books than at a state library.  

Think about it this way - what if President Bush proposed to pay a university in New York City to take a portion of the Library of Congress?  More people would have access to it and it might save the federal government a few bucks, but would it be the right thing to do?

I hope you will reconsider your state library collection move.  Otherwise I will have to take my daughter to Pennsylvania to see what a real state library should look like.

Dick Thornburgh, Pennsylvania's republican governor in the late 70's and early 80's, was respectful of the city that housed the state government he led.  He made necessary economies, kept the budget balanced and was a fine leader.  He was from Pittsburgh and had no personal commitment to the capital city.  At the same time, he did not dismantle it, rather he enhanced it by spearheading the building of a new   airport and working on economic development.  

I am not a state employee nor have I been personally impacted by the cuts you have made. I just happen to live in Tallahassee and I get the feeling it is under attack.  In one of your speeches you bragged about the empty offices your were creating here.  Do you realize that those offices house Florida citizens?

Please help Tallahassee attract new businesses to employ people who have lost their jobs.  I am not talking about minimum wage or entry level positions.  We have three universities housed here, a well-educated populace, a community that is physically beautiful beyond compare, access to pristine beaches, a temperate climate and a low cost of living.  It should be a fairly easy sell.

When you cut, why not try to add?  The business community would be pleased to support you and Tallahassee's citizens would thank you.

I was writing to find out if you knew what was holding up new funds for

Everyone invited to the Friday meeting has received an invitation, thank you for your inquiries, sorry if this was not clear.





Dear Mr. Woodring,

Since your e-mail seems to indicate that I am not invited to the March 21, 2003 meeting, scheduled in Tallahassee as a follow-up to our November 22, 2002 meeting to review the proposed ESE Rules, especially those related to procedural safeguards for students with disabilities, Rule 6A-6.03311, FAC, please find below my original comments sent to Governor Jeb Bush regarding the Proposed ESE Rules and consider them my formal comments to the proposed ESE Rule 6A-6.03311, FAC.  I am also sending them to other members of the State Advisory Council for their formal consideration.  I feel very strongly that without access to due process, there is no access to a free appropriate public education.  

I have no doubt that Berthy de la Rosa Aponte and Milton Aponte as well as Michael Boswell will continue to speak with one voice on behalf of children and youth with disabilities and their families and will carry the same concerns regarding denial of due process that we shared with you and with Kim McDougal at our original meeting on November 22, 2002.  However, I fail to understand the reason why FL DOE has chosen to exclude Laura Prado and I from our participation in the follow-up meeting, especially when, as I have previously stated, I will be in Tallahassee from March 18 until the evening of March 21, 2003, serving on the Florida Independent Living Council, a post to which I was appointed to by Governor Jeb Bush, and my participation will cost the State of Florida DOE no additional money.  FL DOE is leaving me with no other choice but to consider the actions of FL DOE to be retaliatory in nature and we will proceed accordingly.  Florida is supposed to be a beacom of transparency and its agencies, including FL DOE, should be conducting business under the Sunshine Law.  I see no valid reason, other than retaliation, for FL DOE to exclude a citizen and consumer from a meeting that will lead to formal action as the proposed ESE Rules will be eventually adopted.  I do not believe that this meeting is exempt from the provisions of Government under the Sunshine Law.

Dear Governor Bush,

You wrote to me some time back that it was OK to let you know when we
thought we needed your help because it was only when you were aware that
you were able "to go to bat," and that if you were not aware, you "will
not be batting at all," or something similar to that, as I recall it. It
is in that spirit that I am writing to ask for your help and the help of
the members of your cabinet regarding the negative impact that the
Proposed 
State Board of Education Rules for ESE will have on students with
disabilities and
their families if the Rules are approved in the manner that the Florida
Department of Education is proposing them. We are doing some very good
and innovative things in Florida with the McKay Scholarship. President
Bush is working hard on the reauthorization of IDEA and has made
education a top
priority. Please do not allow the Florida Department of Education to
take away
rights from students with disabilities and their families and to
continue to treat students with disabilities as second class citizens in
Florida.


I am not an expert on the proposed rules. There are other parents,
advocates and lawyers in Florida that know a lot more than I do
regarding the proposed rules, but I am volunteering as the messenger. 
The proposed rule that concerns me, as well as many other parents and 
advocates in Florida, the most is Rule 6A-6.03311, FAC - Procedural
Safeguards 
for Students with Disabilities. It is my understanding that the Florida
Department of Education has failed to include mountains of public input
regarding the proposed rules and specifically regarding the proposed
procedural safeguards rules in its latest revisions to the proposed
rules. The Department of Education is attempting to re-write Florida
Statutes by adding language to the rules that contradicts the statutes
and that attempts to take away the rights of students with disabilities
and their families to access fair and impartial administrative due
process hearings as well as to the appeals process. 

The Department of Education has added to the proposed rules that
hearings shall be conducted in accordance with the Uniform Rules for
Administrative Proceedings, Chapter 28-106, FAC and it gives the
Administrative Law Judges authority that not only the statutes do not
provide for but it specifically exempts it, including issuing summary
rulings without even given the parties the opportunity to have a
hearing. The Uniform Rules are very complicated for parents to use, not
to
mention for students with disabilities over the age of 18. In addition,
the
proposed rules give Administrative Law Judges the authority to determine
"whether the parent's advisor or counsel is sufficiently knowledgeable
about or trained with respect to the problems of students with
disabilities." In essence, while the public school boards deny 
students with disabilities an appropriate education and segregate
students and violate their rights and their parents' rights and do not
teach them and do not provide them with access to the general curriculum,
much less with a standard diploma, buy yet they (the school boards) have
attorneys representing them (in many school districts, such as in
Miami-Dade, as many as three or four full-time attorneys) against the
parents 
who are trying to get an education for their child. According to the
proposed rules,
if the parents or the student dare demand their rights, which in some
cases
involves filing a request for due process hearing, the ALJ will have the
authority to decide who is or not qualified to represent the parents and
the students. The parents and students rarely have access to a lawyer or
to a lay advocate and the proposed rules will make them have to deal
with mountains of discovery and with a system that would be so
complicated
and so formal that only lawyers can understand. As we very well know, not
every family in need can find or afford a lawyer with expertise in
special education. The intent of the administrative-level due process 
under IDEA is to have an informal hearing that is fair and impartial and 
that is easy for parents to use. The intent was not for parents to have
to 
hire lawyers to represent them at the administrative due process hearing.

The lawyers should be reserved for real court. The proposed rules would 
make impossible for parents to represent themselves even if a person with

special knowledge and training is available to help them. Parents and
students
should have available to them mediation to resolve disputes but many
school 
districts opt not to participate in mediation (and the proposed rules
make it 
clear that mediation is voluntary in the part of both parties) and rather
bully the
parents and the students 
into either accepting what is not acceptable or being faced with a due
process hearing system so complicated that we may as well pretend not to
have it. 

The ESE due process system in Florida has been unfair to parents and
students for a long time. It was not until recently that we were blessed
in Florida with a case that challenged this. The case is called S.T. v.
School Board of Seminole County that the District Court of Appeal of
Florida for the Fifth District ruled in May of 2001 that Administrative
Law Judges lacked authority to order discovery in Exceptional Student
Education (ESE) due process hearing, as legislature did not confer power
to allow discovery in such hearings, and that unless created by the
constitution, an administrative agency has no common law powers, and has
only such powers as the legislature chooses to confer upon it by
statute.
The case cites Section
230.28(4)(m)5, of the Florida Statutes specifically exempting ESE
hearings from these 
complicated Uniform rules. The Florida Department of Education and the
school boards in Florida are not happy because this case brought to
light
the language, the spirit and the intent of the Florida statutes
governing
ESE due process hearing and with it some fairness to parents and
students
with disabilities, but, of course, now they want to take these rights
away
again through the proposed State Board of Education Rules by attempting
to rewrite 
the law in Florida through rule-making.

Governor Bush, we are counting on you. You cannot let this happen. You
have to help us put a stop to this. We can provide you and your cabinet
with any information that you may need to help in this regard. 

Thank you for your attention to this important matter and, as always, I
remain at your service,

Do all of the schools share your concerns?

Dear Governor:
       The short answer to your question "Do all the schools share your concerns"is no. 
       All of the public (Vocational Technical and Community College) operated massage programs must be at 750 Hours because the Florida Department of Education has mandated that they do so. The Department of Education has changed the mandated number of massage program hours from 720 to 850 to 500 to 750 in the last few years. The last hour increase from 500 to 750 came because teachers in the public school sector said they could not teach a Massage Therapy Program in 500 hours. The department of education now claims that the private school sector must conform to the public schools requirements.
       The public school sector can offer massage therapy programs at 750 hours for $1200.00 because they receive state educational funds. My tuition now is $5000.00 for a 525 hour program. If the Board of Massage Therapy 700 hour proposed rule increase is enacted I will have to increase my tuition to cover the additional costs. I know this will increase an already unfair financial advantage.
       There are about 23 public massage programs on the Department of Health Board of Massage Therapy Approved schools list which all require 750 clock hours. There are about 26 board approved private massage schools whose programs are under 600 hours and there are 54 board approved private schools which programs are under 700 hours. 
       When COMTA (Commission on Massage Therapy Accreditation) applied for recognition from the United States Department of Education to allow them to qualify for title IV funding they were told that they must require a minimum of 600 clock hours. When the hours are increased to 700 or above the schools who are title IV approved will receive the maximum financial benefits from the government. The current minimum clock hour requirements seem to be more about funding than task analysis or scientific studies to determine competencies.
       Some big private schools who already are able to obtain student loans and grants do not care if the hours are increased because they can provide their students with the increased funds.          
       The truth of the matter is that the small private schools are providing their students with quality education (our exam pass rate is over 92% for first time examinations) at 525 clock hours. I know are students are well prepared to enter the profession after graduating from our program and receiving their license. 
       If the Board of Massage wants to increase the hours I believe they should have to state why and then direct the increase in hours to solve the perceived problems. 
       Many of the small private school owners have a concern over the financial impact of the proposed rule change and are still willing to negotiate an increase in hours based on real need.         
       Thank you for inquiring for more information.

CONSUMER DIRECTED CARE PROGRAMS - are made available to 3 distinct waiver populations
-Consumers from the DD waiver recipients (873 people receiving services)
-Aged and Disabled Waiver recipients 
-the traumatic brain injury waiver program beneficiaries

For all 3 populations there are a total of  2, 856 in a unviversity study of CDC programs - with 1128 people in the experimental group receiving services and 1,728 in the control group.  We now have another waiver ammendment pending to extend the program further.  It would add another 357 people. Upon amendment approval by CMS, there will be a total of 3,363 consumers participating in CDC.

As I mentioned, United was covering obesity surgery under our old
certificate of 
coverage.  The new 2001 certificate of coverage, filed with the state
excludes 
coverage for obesity surgery.  New groups and renewing groups will be moving
to 
this certificate of coverage. 

Per our conversation, I have requested the School Board's 2001 claims for 
obesity surgery.  Unfortunately, this information is not readily available.
I 
will provide you with the report as soon as it is available. 

Please let me know if you have any question on this matter.  Thank you.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
            It is with great pleasure that I write you again in support of Marcus J. Ezelle for your consideration for appointment to a Circuit Judgeship.  Judge Ezelle currently sits as the County Judge of Hardee County, Florida.  I have known him for over eighteen (18) years and have never thought of or heard a single negative thing about him.
 
            While Judge Ezelle was in private practice he and I were on the opposite sides of one another and occasionally on the same side in highly contested matters and I have had the opportunity to appear before him in a bench trial.  In every aspect of my dealings with Judge Ezelle I have found him to be very intelligent, highly professional, well versed in the law, practical and a gentlemen.  I sincerely believe that Judge Ezelle would make an extraordinary Circuit Judge.
 
            I am aware of the amount of time you personally spend on the appointment process.  As a citizen of Florida I appreciate your dedicated service as Governor.  I look forward to the possibility of seeing you again soon.
 
                                                                                    Sincerely,

I am writing to thank you and Mr. Struhs for your pushing forward of the purchase of the waterfront property in the Keys. This is truly a wise and insightful move for protecting scarce and imperiled natural lands in Florida.

Also, I noticed additional legislation addressing water quality problems affecting coral reefs. Urban run-off and other relayed effluent are definitely major culprits in algal blooms and poor conditions for our reefs. 

These two acts of environmental protection are critical and it is pleasing to see you all are "on top of it".  Kudos!

Rick, each base will have a community group focused on its mission. The State group, which has good representation from Jacksonville, is focused on how to support all of the bases. I think we are on the right track.

Subject: BRAC Advisory Council


JEB,
Congratulations on a move that puts Florida ahead of other states with a significant military presence (your BRAC Advisory Council). I especially want to commend you on the selection of Captain Winston Scott (retired), a number of us who work at the NAVAIR Depot at Jacksonville knew and admired Winston when he was "One of us".
 
I would like to make an observation or suggestion; while you have what appears to be a "Blue Ribbon Panel", I feel you have a deficit in the membership. The NAVAIR Depot in Jacksonville employees between 3000 to 4000 "Civil Service" and "Contractor Employees", and yet you have no one from this community on your Council. The Civil Servants who have Seniority at this facility have a wealth of experience and knowledge that could be extremely helpful and are well versed in preparations and presentations addressing the BRAC. 
 
May I respectfully request that you place one of our employees on this Council, I truly believe it will add another dimension to your efforts and can be of significant assistance in the Council's efforts. We would welcome the opportunity to assist in safeguarding our future.
 
Ps. Mr. Barry Adams, President, JAX Naval Air Station Association (NASA), has written expressing his views on this issue, he is acting as the "Spokesperson" for all members of JAX NASA, which represents the entire Jacksonville Naval Air Station, including the Depot. 
 
                                                                                                                            Respectfully,
                                                                                                                            Rick Bebout

Subject: Driver's Licenses


Governor Bush:

My name is Mark A. Pacheco and I have been working in a law enforcement
capacity for approximately 14 years.  Soon after 9/11, news reports
reflected that many of the terrorists had obtained driver's licenses even
though there were lookouts on them.  I wrote to several Senators and
Congressman applauding thier efforts to increase security measures such as
including biometrics to prevent this from happening again.  I submitted a
proposal to the various Senators and Congressmen, including you brother,
President Bust, that biometrics be used for all non-U.S. citizens entering
the U.S. as a form of control.  While several Government agencies and many
state and local agencies are adopting biometrics there still is a big
disconnect between the Federal and State levels in the area of interfacing
databases, let me explain with a scenario.

A individual, with bad intentions, arrives into the U.S. and presents the
proper documentation and applies for temporary visitors permit B-2 or a
student permit.  If the individual is not on a lookout and they meet all the
requirments there is a strong likelyhood that he/she will
be granted the permit.   

This individual, that is registered (biometrics) with the Federal government
can now easily move about the U.S. at will.  If this individual has
blackmarket contacts that can provide fraudulant Birth Certificates, Social
Security cards, etc., he can easily obtain any form of identification
document required by most DMVs.  The individual takes these documents to a
local DMV office and applies for an Identification card or Driver's License
with his/her new identity.  Many local DMV offices do not incorporate
biometrics.  They may conduct local checks using the fraudlant name and DOB
and will probably receive a negative
(clear) response and the individual is now validly in the U.S. with a valid
ID under an assumed name.  There is now a permanent disconnect from the
individual that originally entered the U.S. and the same individual under
the assumed name.  Now he/she can go about their evil intentions without
having to worry about alerting anyone.

My proposal:  If state and local government agencies incorporated biometrics
and had an interface with Federal databases this type of scenario could be
avoided and culprits could quickly be stopped and arrested.  Take the
scenario above with local agencies incorporating biometrics and Federal
database interface, when the individual goes to a local DMV office to apply
for an identification card or driver's license the local DMV office, having
biometric capabilities, will take the applicant's fraudulant and biometrics
information and conduct a query against Federal databases.  The response
should be immediate.  The database will quickly detect the discrepancies and
alert the local DMV officials.  These officials can quickly alert the local
law enforcement officials of the alledged crime.  Law Enforcement officers
are dispatched to the DMV office to take the individual into custody.
Federal law enforcement will then be contacted and the violator is turned
over to Federal agents for disposition, arrest and deportation.

Without local database interface with Federal law enforcement database this
type of activity will continue to hamper our efforts to detect and stop
potential terrorists from attacking us again.

If you need further information I can be reached via this email address. If
needed I can provide you with my mailing address or telephone number. If I
can be of further service in further explaining or assisting in implementing
this proposal I am readily availabe.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Citizens' Crime Watch of Miami-Dade County urges all residents to adopt the "Neighborhood Watch" philosophy in the coming days, since we are at the brink of war. It is now the time to unite your neighborhoods, working in unity, not only to protect your families but also contributing to the protection of our Country. Crime Watchers know not to fear the unknown, but to look at it straight ahead and resolve it in partnership. Therefore, you to can be part of the thousands of crime watchers by doing the following:
1.  Go out and meet your neighbors.
2.  Develop a "phone chain" directory of your neighbors. Include emergency contact information, police, fire, team metro, your local elected officials and FBI field office.
3. Indicate and identify neighbors who need additional help, and develop a plan to assist them in an emergency.
4. Contact family members and develop a plan to meet should you be separated in case an emergency arises.
Know the Routines...Be alert as you go about your daily business. This will help you to learn the normal routines of your neighborhood, community and workplace. Understanding these routines will help you to spot anything out of place.
Be Aware...Get to know your neighbors. Be on the lookout for suspicious activities such as unusual conduct in your neighborhood and workplace.
Take What you Hear Seriously...If you hear or know of someone who has bragged or talked about plans to harm citizens, or you see activities that don't look "normal" or "feel" normal, take it seriously and report it to your local law enforcement. Remember those that attacked us, lived among us.
Citizens' Crime Watch of Miami-Dade, asks all citizens and those who are Crime Watchers, that now more than ever, you are the "eyes and ears" of our law enforcement partners and of our great country.

Okay without getting gushy - you have made my day. I have had 2 weeks of feeling like the legislature - the House - is eating their young. That was a lobbyist comment to me which I ducked. We are the state's award winning virtual high school. It seems like it doesn't matter. 

Governor Bush - I'm not sucking up...you are my hero...I have faith that you believe in the organization that I represent, which is why I do what I do, rather than having a comfortable school principalship. I just want to help the kids. I don't always have the perfect documentation, but I try to show results. I will always do whatever I can do to serve your mission. My family is a Bush family and I believe in you. 

I want to be part of your solution. I'll do my best if I know what you want me to do. 

I was told today by a House Aide that we needed to sacrifice quality for money. I was stunned. Our costs are at $350 below the state average and save the state on peco and construction. We are the cheapest in the country. We can provide high quality at the same price as the average school district - just let us do what we do!!!!

Dear Governor Bush, 
See your name in lights in our school newsletter. By the way, our newsletter is an award winning publication. 

We are plugging away with the funding model. You and the Senate are on the same page. We are experiencing difficulty in the House. I expect Mark will contact you. We desperately believe it is time to be in the FEFP. With the class size amendment, this is the year. Apparently there are issues with the mechanics of adding a line to the FEFP for FLVS and I have been told that the introduction of K12 Inc. has complicated our existence. I know it is complicated but I think it is the year to push it. 

If you are so inclined to push it, please go for it. 

Governor Bush - I know that I contact you directly maybe too often. I admire your accessibility to the little people. If I overstep my bounds of coming to you directly, just smack me please. I will respect and take it. 

Do take a look at the newsletter. I told the kids I would alert you that the photo was there and they really do value you as the FLVS daddy.

Collins Building, Suite 224

AMENDED COMPLAINT:  Case #:  FEC 03 078
 
Election Commission:
 
I’m in receipt of your idiotic dismissal epistle, dated 13 March, and in all sincerity it carries all the earmarks of the proverbial whitewash!  Specifically:
 
By you own admission you have CONFIRMED that Robert Jackson DID violate Florida Statute 106.143(3) but then state “…his two earlier advertisements correctly indicated that he was supported by the local (union).”  What kind of perverted logic is this?  He broke the law, you have confirmed that he violated the law and compounding this you claim that his two earlier advertisements didn’t…advertisements that I’ve been totally unable to locate.  The ad’s I mailed you, all three of them,  were the political advertisements I received.  How could I comment on something I’ve never seen?  And I’ve yet to find anyone who did receive the alleged “two earlier pieces.”
 
If you have the alleged two earlier pieces please mail me copies.
 
You further state that Florida Chapter 104 is not applicable.  Let me get this straight, he lied on the flyers I mailed you, he had union employee’s stationed at the polls, union folks wearing T-shirts proclaiming “Largo Professional Firefighters,” yet you claim that this does not violate 104’s “…corruptly influencing voters.”  Multiple applications of stretching the truth, taking GREAT editorial license on advertisements that were overt lies and employing union representatives to man the polls is NOT ‘…corruptly influencing” the voter?  If this is not, pray tell, what is?
 
So stated the “legal sufficiency” of my complaint is without question!  By your own admission he DID violate the law but using your logic Willie Sutton was not a bank robber because he intended to rob four banks but only robbed two.  Robert Jackson DID mail out two flyers that contained blatant misrepresentations, you’ve confirmed this, I received them yet because he didn’t send our four of them my complaint is summarily dismissed and/or lacks sufficiency.  Whitewash?  We shall see.
 
Perhaps this amended complaint should be addressed to the Governor…perhaps it’s time to investigate the investigators.
 
 
In theory the Election Commission is supposed to enforce election laws yet when presented with overwhelming evidence of malfeasance rather than investigate it you choose to find every avenue available to dismiss it.  You admit that there was wrong doing yet don’t wish to pursue the wrongdoer.  Via your own words “…Jackson’s advertisements would have been more accurate…” BUT THEY WEREN’T!!  A bank robber would not be a bank robber if he didn’t rob banks.
 
In conclusion I’m questioning the viability of the Election Commission.  It appears as though you’re going more than the extra mile to disprove, or minimize, overt acts of election law violations.
 
Please, do send me copies of the alleged two other pieces…and I am respectively requesting a full investigation of my PROVEN charges.
 
Sincerely,
 
 
 
Curtis A. Holmes

Subject: RE: Serious Matter in Bay County


Mr. Bush, the following e-mail was sent on Sunday night to your office.  Today I did not receive a reply so am sending the same message directly to you.  I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.  


Tonight I was speaking to my neighbor Charles Smith.  He told me something that really disturbed me and that he had E-mailed your office last Friday regarding this matter.

I know that according to Florida Statues you cannot claim homestead exemption for a house that you do not live in.  If I understand the law as it appears on our local Property Appraiser's Web Site, this is a misdemeanor punishable by up to 1 year in prison and up to a $5,000 fine or both. 

It seems, according to Mr. Smith, that we have a County Commissioner, George Gainer, who is claiming homestead exemption on his property.  The commissioner ran for a district that he does not reside in and was elected.  After the election he rented an apartment and I am told he moved into the district that he represents, which if I understand the law is allowable.  However HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION FRAUD IS NOT LEGAL. 

Mr. Smith also explained to me that he went to the County Commission Meeting last Thursday night and was going to bring the matter up.  He spoke with Chairman Jerry Girvin and with Commissioner Mike Ropa and both of them asked him not to bring it up.  Chairman Jerry Girvin remarked to Mr. Smith that this is an impeachable offense and that bringing it up at the meeting would cause a lot of turmoil and would disrupt the meeting.  He asked for Mr. Smith's phone number and told him that he would call him the next day.  Mr. Smith complied with Chairman Girvin and Commissioner Mike Ropa's request.  As of tonight Mr. Smith has not had a call from Mr. Grivin.

I realize that it was Friday when Mr. Smith E-mailed your office and that you have not had time to respond to this matter.  A simple phone call to the property appraiser's office will give you the information you need to check this matter out.  Mr. Gayner's house is not in the district he is representing therefore he cannot file homestead exemption on it.  

I trust that Mr. Smith and I will be hearing from you regarding this matter.

Mr. Gott:
 
The Governor asked me to look into your suggestion on expanding work release.
 
First, let me say that it has merit and we have been considering the possibility of moving it from 7 months to 12 months.
 
It appears that we would have a maximum of about 2,000 inmates who would be added to those who could be considered.  The exact savings would be determined based on weather we outsourced it, which would mean a higher per diem or weather we tried to do it "in house", which would mean about $70,000,000 in new capital outlay.
 
In either case, our savings would probably be somewhere around $8 million each year.
 
These, of course, are very preliminary numbers and I'm not ready to "take them to the bank".
 
Finally, we still must analyze the risk factor and see what we might project in the way of escapes or failure to complete the program.  
 
Again, we are looking into this possibility and very much appreciate your suggestion.
 
Jimmy Crosby

Dear Governor
It is my understanding that you went to Washington looking for money to balance the state budget. I also understand that money would come from Medicaid and health insurance for Floridians. 
 
May I suggest that you consider a resource already available to you right here in Florida? A resource that has a minimum resource potential of more than $56 Million and potentially MUCH more. That resource is the inmate work release program.
 
If the work release program were extended to 85% non-violent offenders from 7 months to 12 months, taking the 45% of their wages (which the state already takes) would produce a MINIMUM of $56 million and maybe even MUCH more.
 
EXAMPLE:
One inmate making $6 an hour would get a 40-hour weekly pay of $240. That translates to $12480 a year. The state takes 45% of that which translates to $5615. Do that with 10,000 inmates and the state gets a minimum of $56,150,000.
 
As you can see the potential would increase if the minimum wage were higher and as I'm sure you know there are non-violent offenders in state custody that have the qualifications that could demand much more than $6 an hour.
 
Just something to think about
 
I pray for you and your brother both everyday sir
 
GOD BLESS AND KEEP YOU BOTH

Jeb - a local attorney told me that the malpractice insurance underwriters
were asked if they would reduce their rates upon passage of a pain and
suffering cap at $250,000.  According to him, their answer was no.

It would seem to me that two things need to be done for wavering senators:

a) point out that a reduction in rates is not needed simultaneously with a
reduction in liability - the physicians can simply carry a lower amount of
insurance coincident with a lower amount of potential liability

b) the legislation should require in its language that carriers of
malpractice insurance must appear before the insurance commissioner one year
from passage and present and defend their rates in view of the experience
gained under the new statute.

I believe if both of those were done it might help move a handful of votes
to the yes column.

Subject:	Medical model & EDUCATION are key to mental wellness & sound economy

March 19, 2003  To: Florida Department of Children & Families

Dear Secretary Regeir:

Over fourteen years ago, I had a manic episode and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I have remained well and healthy, despite this serious mental illness diagnosis, with a simple visit to a psychiatrist every six months, learning about the "do's and don'ts" of staying well through reading and peer support groups, and by faithfully taking daily medication.  

Many other Florida residents with mental illnesses have not lead healthy, productive lives. This is often because they have never been provided accurate medical information about their unrecognized brain illnesses.  Without proper medical care and my prompt diagnosis, I could have easily ended up as one of the statistics of addiction, incarceration, or even suicide. Unmedicated people with bipolar have a one in five chance of killing themselves.

For the following reasons, and many more, Florida's over one and one-half million mentally ill citizens need MH/SA focussed on a strong medical model of treatment and recovery:

1) During the past seven years of my advocacy [SEE webpage link with signature], I have consistently found that DCF employees had not received training, and lacked a basic medical understanding of the five major mental illnesses [depression, bipolar, schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder]. They lacked the basics. They had not learned the symptoms, the percentages of each disorder in the population and at each age group, the link to substance abuse as self-medication, the ages of onset, and the recovery rates. They did not know the names of accomplished people have or had the disorders, and who were role models of recovery. They were not aware of basic medical facts needed to help the clients/patients get and stay well.

2) Without a medical understanding of the brain illnesses, the great opportunity for prevention of severe illness and the greater than 50% likelihood for recovery are both missed.  The greatest chances for prevention of chronic and severe mental illness require early recognition and prompt treatment when symptoms first onset. 

I found few in DCF who even realized that people with bipolar disorder could recover. They were unaware that many highly accomplished people with brain illnesses are forced to hide their diagnosis, despite their professional accomplishments, fearing the great public discrimination and stigma.  Following a firm "medical model" would provide a more accurate picture of brain illnesses and would include the large numbers of successful people living in our communities with mental illness diagnoses. This will do much to fight discrimination and denial. This would restore "justice for all" to many who, like me, are well, yet face open discrimination in insurance, employment, courtrooms, the media, and in society as a whole.

3) The DOH and the "medical model" have worked to educate our communities about such illnesses as diabetes, AIDS, heart disease, and other common, treatable illnesses.  DCF has not devoted funds to educating our public about mental conditions as being the common, treatable brain illnesses which they are. DCF has not taught the medical link between substance abuse and untreated mental illness. This interferes with early recognition and treatment.  This lack of public education increases the stigma and community misunderstanding, which discourages the needed medications, proper medical treatment, and recovery.

4) Our communities have great respect for Florida's medical doctors.  DCF has not placed the medical doctors who specialize in brain illness, i.e. Florida's psychiatrists, in the forefront to help educate our communities about the brain illnesses. The view of many that licensed mental health counselors and other talk therapists are all that is needed, and saving psychiatrists for only for the most chronically, severely ill patient [who may already be past the point of recovery],  prevents thousands of Floridians from becoming and remaining taxpaying, healthy Florida citizens, who happen to have brain illnesses.

5) There are many false practices in the area of mental health. These can be corrected with proper oversight by physicians skilled in "best medical practices" and who follow the latest medical advances and research. When talk therapy wrongfully delays or discourages psychiatric care, proper safeguards are needed to protect the mentally ill. Brain wellness requires that patients receive prompt and proper medical treatment.

6) This matter is urgent due to the vast economic impact of delayed treatment on Florida's economy.  The longer common mental illnesses such as depression and bipolar [together affecting over 10% of Florida's population] are not properly treated, the more severe the symptoms frequently become. Also, it takes less stress to trigger successive episodes of illness,  so periods of illness occur more and more frequently. The more episodes of illness a person has, the less likely the person will ever recover and become a healthy, productive, taxpaying citizen.  Equally and urgently significant is the fact that delayed treatment greatly increases the likelihood that a person will turn to substance abuse as a form of "self-medication." Mental illness symptoms can be very uncomfortable and substance abuse brings a temporary chemical [dopamine increase] relief for these desperate individuals. Adding substance abuse to people with untreated brain illnesses greatly increases the likelihood of violence, expensive and repeated incarcerations, and suicides, or the expensive attempted suicides.

7) The fastest way to restore mental wellness and justice to Florida is to enforce the school laws. The Sunshine State Standards already MANDATE that children lean "mental and emotional health" in grades K-12. Simply teaching the young, unbiased children that "brains can get sick too, and then get well, like other parts of the body," will do much to encourage early treatment and to kill the stigma. When children learn in school that Abe Lincoln and Winston Churchill had bipolar disorder, their fear and misunderstanding of this common illness will greatly decrease.

Mr. Regeir, providing early recognition and proper care for Florida's mentally ill will do much to strengthen our economy, restore productivity to the over one million Florida residents with mental illnesses, and will create a healthier, more just, and safer society.

I look forward to meeting you tomorrow.

Sincerely,
Angela

Subject:	School Management Matters

Jeb,

I was dropping my kids off at The Growing Place and I see the owner/principal, who is also my son's first grade teacher, unloading a truck full of toys. She explained how she was shopping at California's newest department store, Kohls, and noticed that all Fisher Price toys were 50 percent off. So she bought $1000 worth of toys for her school. She didn't have to fill out any paperwork or go through a cumbersome procurement process or wait 6 months for her request to be approved--she just bought the toys and the kids will begin playing with them immediately. Unfortunately, in most public schools financial decisions at the local school level are rare and there is more at stake than just toys. 

Professor William G. Ouchi and his colleagues at UCLA's Anderson School of Management have done some excellent new work comparing management practices of large school districts and how those practices effect student achievement. Recently members of Hawaii Governor Lingle's education brain trust were looking for a model to reorganize Hawaii's school district. I sent them William Ouchi's research and Reason Public Policy Institute Fellow and Hawaii correspondent Cliff Slater wrote a terrific column for the Honolulu Advertiser summarizing Ouchi's work and applying it to Hawaii's unique centralized education system. 


Hawaii Education: Here's the Answer
By Cliff Slater

With fortuitous timing for Hawai'i's legislators, Professor William G. Ouchi (one of Hawai'i's own) and his colleagues at UCLA's Anderson School of Management have published the first ever comparative study [i] of the management practices of large school districts.

For the purpose of comparing centralized and decentralized districts, the authors chose three of each. The three centralized school districts chosen were, Los Angeles, New York and Chicago. The three decentralized districts selected were Seattle, Houston and Edmonton, Canada, which have recently changed to the type of decentralized plan that was first implemented in Edmonton in 1977. 

The study essentially first determined how centralized each district was based on: (1) the relative number of employees directly controlled by the central office (many of whom may work in schools but not for the principal) [ii] ; (2) the percent of the school's budget that is controlled by the school principal; and (3) what share of budgets reach the classroom.

Each decentralized school makes its own decisions of who to hire, how many part-time or full-time staff, which books and materials to purchase, how much to spend on electricity and computers, and how much of the budget to allocate to teacher training. 

The small central office staff takes advantage of economies of scale only where it is efficient, such as handling insurance, payroll, and information technology. In addition, it monitors and audits the financial and educational results for the individual schools. Reflecting this greater local discretion, the central office also provides extensive budget training to school staff and has teams of experts available to answer questions. [iii] 

The decentralized districts monitor the schools by using an "exceptions" approach, calibrating the degree of scrutiny to the past performance of a school, intervening only when they spot problems from financial and management reports.

The decentralized districts have adopted Weighted Student Funding (WSF) which provides each principal with funding arrived at by calculating, for each student, an amount that is the basic per-student allocation adjusted plus any state and federal funding available for gifted students, emotionally disabled or autistic students, poor students, and non-native English speakers. 

That funding follows each student to the school they choose since these districts have all adopted a policy allowing students to attend any public school in the district.

Here are the effects of decentralization:

They found that while the school principals in centralized districts only control 10% of their budgets, those in the decentralized districts control 75%. In fact, Edmonton's principals control 92% of their budgets. [iv] 

And because each principal in these schools is responsible for, and has authority over, most of their budget, there are few excuses they can make for failures of student performance.

In Seattle, Houston, and Edmonton, the authors said they rarely met a principal who did not know the details of student achievement in every classroom, while in New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago, they rarely did. Nor did they know how much money was in their budgets, while in the three decentralized districts; they knew it down to the last dollar. [v] 

They found that decentralized districts put more money in classrooms. For example, Los Angeles District spends only 45% of its resources in the classroom, while Edmonton, Canada, had 60.5%. Thus, if Los Angeles were as efficient as Edmonton, it would have an additional $2,200 per student annually. [vi] 

Principals are easy to recruit in decentralized districts. In the centralized system principals are held responsible for student outcomes, yet they have no control over the staffing or budgets of their schools, without which they cannot take the steps that will produce improvement. Thus, principals positions are much sought after in Edmonton, Seattle, and Houston whereas recruitment has become a problem in centralized districts. [vii] 

This study found superior performance for all students, particularly minority ones, in the decentralized schools. 

The authors concluded that they were able to "clearly and dramatically to establish that decentralized systems give principals greater control over their resources and that these systems drive more personnel and financial resources down to schools and classrooms … Most important of all, our results suggest that a properly organized school district can produce superior educational results for children, including those of low-income, minority homes." [viii] 

Hawai'i can do this. 

It is a system popular with the very strong teachers' unions of Edmonton and Seattle, as it is with the "weak" unions in Houston since the decentralized districts do not create a punitive environment for teachers. 

Read the study. The lesson it offers is that once Hawai'i's leaders recognize that there is nothing wrong with our students or our teachers, but that it is DOE management that needs reform, our schools can begin to be ones of which we can, once again, be proud.


Here is the link to the article with footnotes: http://www.rppi.org/hawaiieducation.html


William Ouchi has also presented some very interesting data about per-pupil spending in Los Angeles and California. He found that the 298 Catholic schools in Los Angeles spend an average of about $2,500 per student in elementary schools and $5,100 per student in high school and reported a Los Angeles Business Journal survey that found that for 25 independent schools in Los Angeles, the average annual tuition was $7,091. By contrast, Ouchi found that when school facility construction costs are added into the funding mix, the Los Angeles Unified School District spent a total of $13,267 per student for the 2000-2001 school year. Here's my thought experiment (i.e. pipe dream): Using the Los Angeles Independents School tuition figure of $7,000 (which is higher than the national per-pupil spending average) and letting the $7,000 follow each of the 5,954,154 California children to a school of his or her parent's choice would cost close to $42 billion and save California $10 billion in 2003-2004 $52 billion K12 education budget. Just a thought.


I encourage you to read William Ouchi's work as school districts across the nation grapple with district management practices that have real consequences for student performance.

Subject:	Medicaid Task Force update

Governor.....finally!  The Medicaid Task Force staff met late this afternoon.  Patton and Kempthorne were unable to "announce the Task Force" due to the death of Idaho's Senate Leader's son.  The funeral was today, Kempthorne attended and could not make the call w/ Patton and press.

They are hoping to make the formal announcement sometime this week.  They will try to make it happen before a scheduled conference call w/ Task Force Governors.  We have been asked to determine your availability on Thursday, March 20, at 1:30 p.m.----this would be the initial call of Task Force Governors.  The agenda for this call would be to provide guidance to staff.  They hope to discuss principles and and action plan.  We talked about an "end-date."  Thompson feels certain that we need to have a proposal by May 1.  A few D's were hestitant but ultimately everyone agreed that we need to move expeditiously. 

Generally the meeting went well.  There were some very partisan remarks made but, we found that the Missouri Director was reasonable, as was the head of NGA (Ray Scheppach).  The plans are that staff will meet regularly, twice weekly.  They are hopeful that Governors will talk by phone once weekly.  Those calls will be made Wednesday afternoon.  Is there a particular time that you might prefer?

It happens that the National Medicaid Directors Association will meet here in DC over the next few days.  HHS/CMS is planning to meet w/ the Executive Board of the Directors, and detail the Administration's Medicaid proposal.  HHS hopes to start putting some meat on the bones by asking a series of questions of the Directors.  We will make sure to stay in touch w/ Bob Sharpe for these decisions.

Once the Task Force is announced, Patton and Kempthorne will send "letters of introduction" to key Members of Congress and Sec Thompson.  We will be able to review those letters before they go out.

It is anticipated that at some point, the Task Force Governors will meet in DC in order to "cut the deal" w/ Thompson and carry the message to Congress.  more later.....Nina

Mr. Clerk....please give a copy of this to each Commissioner and the mayor. Thank you.
 
Commissioners. Thank you for your positive vote last night on the Proclamation to express support of the men and women of the Gainesville area who have been called to active duty at this time in our history.  The wording of the proclamation was appropriate and  did not take sides on the pending war in Iraq.  The wording did acknowledge the sacrifice these service personnel and their families are making as well as those innocent of the circumstances in the Mid East being place in harm's way.
My son Byron, who was called to active Coast Guard duty from his job with the State Attorney's Office in Gainesville is very pleased that you were considerate enough to pass the Proclamation. He said it "made him feel good."  He also said he doesn't understand why our Mayor, Mr. Bussing, did not vote for the Proclamation and thereby show support for his constituents now on involuntary service for Gainesville, and the U.S.A.  Many of us wonder the same. 
 
Thank you for your public service.

Dear Governor Jeb Bush:

I regret to inform you of this tragedy shown in the article below. There is no excuse to justify this horrendous crime, which happens so frequently but is mostly ignored. Many in our world, including myself, are angry & blame your own government for what has happened, from your policies & from our taxes, we have supported this destruction for generations, ignorant to the consequences, sacrficing our hard earned money to support this in the trillions over the years. 

Nevertheless, Sept. 11th did not go in vain, it was a wake up call, in our new-age, new-generation, in our new century of technology, we are more aware & informed then ever, in solidarity against war & its consequence. This tragic news has gathered little US media coverage as the world focuses on Iraq.

I hope that you can take a little bit of your time to go over this article so that you may be more conscious of how government policy is affecting our world. This will no longer be tolerated, it should not be tolerated by any conscious human being, I am a compassionate man, I must keep myself aware, but when tragedies of this proportion happen, & continue to be ignored & justified, it makes me sick. I hope you can realize the magnitude of this news & act in whatever way you can, because with your power comes responsibility & I am sure you are very aware of this. Please respond when you are ready, & send me whatever comments or requests you may have, I hope to hear from you soon.

Most Sincerely & Respectfully Yours,

Alexander

Rest in Peace, Rachel

By Ramzy Baroud*  - March 17, 2003

It is the responsibility of the High Contracting Parties to ensure 
Israel's 
respect of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, Relative to the 
Protection  of Civilian Persons in the Time of War. 

Part IV, Section I, Article 142 of the Convention states that 
"representatives of religious organizations, relief societies, or any 
other 
organizations assisting the protected persons, shall receive from these 
Powers, for themselves or their duly accredited agents, all facilities 
for 
visiting the protected persons, for distributing relief supplies and 
material 
from any source, intended for educational, recreational or religious 
purposes, or for assisting them in organizing their leisure time within 
the 
places of internment." 

It's disheartening to see how international law is being abused by 
those 
whose selectively in interpreting the law the governs our world has 
rendered  it "irrelevant" a long time ago. 

The above references to the Fourth Geneva Convention, which remains the 
most  important frame of reference to the conduct of war, mostly 
dealing with the responsibility of an occupying power, is of no concern to 
the United States, apparently, for the most upfront violator of such a 
law is the state of  Israel. 

Israel has violated a long list of UN Resolutions, whether Security 
Council 
or General Assembly. Even the repeated American veto throughout the 
years  were hardly enough to safe Israel from its duty before 
international law. In fact, Israel's legitimacy as a member of the international 
community was  never obtained in the first place, since the state of 
Israel was a 
conditional member, whose membership was conditioned on the 
implementation of  UN Resolution 181 and 194, both are nowhere near being 
fulfilled. 

Of course, the everyday practices of the Israeli army and government 
are good  enough reminders of the failure of the so-called international 
community to uphold its own principals, and good enough indications of 
the continuing  violations of international law. But today, was a 
louder reminder that will most likely catch the attention of many. 

Yesterday, Sunday March 16, Rachel Corrie, a sweet, 23 year old 
American 
activist, was run over by an Israeli army bulldozer, and then buried by 
the 
debris, in the refugee camp of Rafah, to the south of Gaza City. 

Rachel, from the town of Olympia, in Washington State, stood before 
Israeli 
bulldozers, as they tore down a building that belongs to a "protected 
person"  because no one else, but Rachel and a few of her comrades dared 
to challenge  the Israeli army. There is a bittersweet irony in her 
tragic death. Rachel should not have been in Palestine, she should have 
been at home, studying for her exams. The United Nations should have been 
blocking Israeli bulldozers, since they were the institution designated 
to provide protection to the  refugees. Rachel's death does not only 
reflect the depth of her humanity, but it also reflects the tremendous 
failure of the United Nations, or perhaps their indifference, to this 
crucial task.  

I don't think that Rachel was thinking of Geneva Conventions or had a 
particular UN resolution in mind when she laid down before the Israeli 
bulldozer, and before the Israeli driver buried her under the sand and 
then 
ran over her, despite the pleas of people to stop. But I can imagine 
the rage  that went through the young woman's head as she decided to use 
her body to stand between the army bulldozer and the Palestinian 
refugees. 

"Rachel was alone in front of the house as we were trying to get them 
to 
stop," Greg Schnabel, 28, from Chicago told the Associated Press. "She 
waved for bulldozer to stop and waved. She fell down and the bulldozer 
kept going.

We yelled 'stop, stop', and the bulldozer didn't stop at all. It had 
completely run over her and then it reversed and ran back over her," he 
said. 

I recall my interview with Um Jamal Al-Shalabi, of Jenin, as she 
narrated her 
own story with the bulldozers that also refused to stop and demolished 
the  house over her paralyzed son, Jamal. "We have a schedule to keep," 
Um Jamal  was told by the bulldozer driver, who along with his 
colleague demolished  entire neighborhoods, and on many occasions, did so while 
people were still inside. 

Although tragic, nothing is out of the ordinary as far as Israeli 
conduct in 
the occupied territories is concerned. Just recently an Israeli sniper 
in 
Jenin shot and killed Ian Hook, a United Nations coordinator who was 
dispatched to help the refugees put their lives back together after the 
historic invasion of the camp in April of 2002. Israel claimed that it 
appeared as if Hook had a gun in his hand, not a cell phone. But they 
failed 
to explain why they left the British worker to bleed to death, as his 
Palestinian colleagues tried to save his life. I wonder how Israel 
plans to 
explain to media the death of Rachel, did her frail body pose a threat 
to the 
safety of the Israeli army? Or was it just another "honest mistake"? 

While well over 200,000 American and nearly 50,000 British soldiers are 
ready to invade Iraq, regardless of how such an invasion is interpreted 
under international law, people like us, students, mothers and fathers 
from all over the world are flooding the Occupied Territories to 
provide some sort of protection to the Palestinian people. Like Rachel, their 
bodies are their  only ammunition before the mammoth Israeli Merchava 
tanks and D-9 bulldozers.  They're angry, like many of us, because of 
this untold hypocrisy of the  United States government, and the failure 
of the "High Contracting Parties," to live up the law they drafted and 
to the resolutions for which they voted. 

A great deal is told about the brutality of any army that doesn't mind 
running over a young woman for simply protesting the demolishing of a 
house in Rafah or a paralyzed man in Jenin. But also stories of courage 
are told,  not only by the Palestinian people, but also by those 
amazing individuals who  literary sacrifice their lives to stand by another 
people, forgotten by the  international community and deemed irrelevant 
when laws are implemented. 

I am sorry, Rachel, that you had to die such a death; your screams on 
al-Jazeera broke my heart, as they broke the hearts of many. But it's 
not the  bulldozer driver, a war criminal under every law, that I am 
angry at, but the  US government that supplied Israel with the weapons and 
political cover to  kill you and thousands of other innocents. 

Today, Rachel our blood is united; you stood and fell defending what is 
just 
and honorable. Maybe we will not be able to give you the honor and 
gratitude  that you deserve, but Rachel, I promise you, that every 
Palestinian, but every human being of conscience is paying tribute to you. Rest 
in peace.

Dear Governor,

	Study: Generic Juice Ads Work

LAKELAND -- A $190,000 research study on generic advertising for Florida orange juice reached a multimillion-dollar conclusion for the Florida Department of Citrus.

A draft report of the study released Friday concluded the Citrus Department's generic advertising program has significantly increased retail demand for orange juice during the past 14 years while brand advertising has had relatively little effect in drawing more consumers to the beverage.

"Because of (the Citrus Department's) advertising efforts, nearly 740,000 more gallons of orange juice were sold each month at retail supermarkets and supercenters from January 1989 to September 2002, (or) roughly 8.9 million more gallons per year," said the report from Forecasting and Business Analytics LLC, a research firm run by agricultural economists from Texas A&M University.

The department spent about $22 million annually on generic orange juice advertising during that period, according to the report. After adjusting for inflation, each dollar in spending led to the sale of an additional 0.62 gallons.

"In contrast, our statistical evidence . . . reveals that branded advertising expenditures on orange juice have no statistically significant impact on per-capita consumption of orange juice," the report said.

That's because advertising by the major orange juice brands -Tropicana Products Inc. in Bradenton, the Minute Maid Co. of Houston and Florida's Natural Growers Inc. in Lake Wales -- focuses on increasing each company's share of the orange juice market over stimulating consumer demand.

"Consequently, branded advertising expenditures for orange juice do not materially increase overall orange juice consumption," the report said.

Those findings sat well with Bob Crawford, executive director of the Citrus Department, a state agency whose primary mission is the promotion and marketing of the state's citrus crop.

"It's incredibly good news for the Department of Citrus," Crawford said on Friday. "The research strongly indicates the generic advertising program at the Department of Citrus has real value to the growers of the state."

Previous studies by the department's own economists also showed generic advertising helped increase orange juice consumption while branded advertising only affected market share, he said.

"The value of the Department of Citrus is that we grow the pie," Crawford said. "Growers don't benefit by slicing the pie. They benefit by growing the pie."

Florida citrus growers skeptical of the effectiveness of generic orange juice advertising led the Florida Citrus Commission, the department's ruling body, to commission the Business Analytics study.

The department spends about 80 percent of its annual budget, almost $65 million for its 2003 fiscal year, on marketing Florida citrus, and orange juice is by far the largest marketing program. Juice oranges account for more than 70 percent of the state's annual citrus crop.

Florida growers finance most of the department's budget through a tax on each box of citrus harvested in the state.

Growers became increasingly frustrated with the box tax during the past several citrus seasons because of the low prices the state's juice processors were paying for fruit. At the price levels of the past two seasons, the box tax took as much as a third of some growers' profits.

That led some growers to call for drastic reductions in the box tax, which would have led to a significant contraction of the Citrus Department, which employs about 100 people.

Pressure from members led Lakeland-based Florida Citrus Mutual, the state's largest growers' representative, and other regional grower groups to call for an independent analysis of the effectiveness of the department's generic advertising as opposed to previous internal studies.

A Citrus Commission committee, the Generic Advertising Review Committee, in June hired the Texas research firm because of its experience in studying similar issues regarding other agricultural commodities and because it had no previous connection with Florida citrus.

The draft report covers only the first of three research objectives. In addition to measuring the ability of generic advertising to increased orange juice demand, the research will attempt to measure how much of that increased demand gets back to Florida growers in terms of higher fruit prices.

The third objective will analyze how generic advertising works best to increase consumer demand and prices to growers.

The Advertising Committee is scheduled to review the complete report at an April 15 meeting. The Citrus Commission is scheduled to review the report the next day.

The generic ad study looked at Citrus Department spending on orange juice advertising since 1989. The department's advertising is called "generic" because it promotes buying orange juice without mentioning brand names.

Consumption data was based on sales data from ACNielsen, the Chicago marketing research firm best known for measuring the audience for television programs.

Nielsen measures only sales from supermarkets and other food retailers with at least $2 million in annual sales, which covers almost 63 percent of orange juice consumption, the report said.

The remaining 37 percent of consumption comes from restaurants, hospitals and other institutional vendors, said Ron Ward, an agriculture economist at the University of Florida who advised the Texas firm on technical aspects of the study.

Since the Citrus Department's generic campaign focuses on retail consumption at home, the lack of "away-from-home" institutional sales data would not significantly affect the study's results, Ward said.

Subject: Workers' Compensation System in Florida


Dear Governor Bush:


First, at this critical time, our nation and the world are fortunate to have President Bush at the helm.  I want to express my support of your brother's leadership, courage, and steady hand.

I am president of FCCI Insurance Company, the largest domestic workers' compensation insurance provider in Florida.  We have spoken before, and my previous e-mails have outlined my thoughts on the state of the workers' compensation system in Florida.   I am aware of your concern and interest in the workers' compensation system and the need for meaningful reform.  I greatly appreciate your involvement and believe any meaningful solution will require your personal participation and leadership.

As a participant and observer of past efforts to provide a workers' compensation system that works for all, I must share with you my thoughts and concerns regarding the current activities in Tallahassee.   While I have an understanding of the legislative process and acknowledge the large contingency of folks attempting to "fix" the system or protect their individual interest, the solutions needed clearly are presented in the information and data reviewed by your commission and the Legislature.  

	The information and data provided to your commission and the Legislature raises the following areas of concern, which also are reflected in FCCI's data:  

1.	The definition of permanent total disability needs to be rewritten.

		2.	Permanent partial benefits need to be increased for the injured worker.

		3.	Physicians are under compensated, while hospitals over compensated.

4.	The issue of attorney's fees must be addressed. 

Regarding permanent total disability, the information and data show a much greater frequency of permanent total disability in Florida.  This is the direct result of a 1994 change to Florida law mandating the use of federal standards.  Definitions that will fix this problem are already in existing legislative proposals.   Closely related to permanent total disability  is the permanent impairment benefit.  When it is argued that Florida has the lowest benefits and the highest rates, people are referring to the benefits for permanent impairment, not the entire workers' compensation system.  Take for example FCCI's experience last year.  FCCI paid $240 million in workers' compensation benefits last year, of which $8 million was for permanent total and $4.8 million was for permanent partial. However, we paid settlements of $100 million.  In order to reduce this amount there must be a middle ground between our very low permanent impairment benefit schedule and permanent total disability.  Making permanent total disability more difficult to obtain and increasing permanent partial benefits would deter the use of attorneys and also allows for a better frame work for negotiation.     Today, an injured worker with 5% impairment and a $300 per week compensation rate receives about $2,200 for his impairment.  The same worker claiming permanent total disability would receive benefits of about $300,000.  Having a system which forces a negotiation between $2,200 and $300,000 does not work.    

Out of the $240 million in benefits paid by FCCI last year, $24 million was paid to physicians and $36 million to hospitals.   Throughout the 1990s, the amounts paid for these two categories were roughly equal until 1999.  This disparity has widened in the last two years.   There is a shortage of physicians caused by under compensation, but there is certainly no shortage of hospitals.  Workers' compensation insurers are the highest reimbursement source they have.  The compensation rate for hospitals needs to be addressed. 

Finally, the hourly rate for attorneys needs to be abolished.  Florida's system promotes the use of attorneys.  The system rewards the claimant's attorney who builds up hours in a case by obtaining unnecessary medical care or benefits simply for purposes of being paid attorney's fees.  This results in the injured worker sitting around in doctors' offices or hospitals waiting for unnecessary care.  The injured worker needs money and needs it quickly.   One possible solution would be to have a larger contingency for the claimant's attorneys giving them the incentive to settle the cases as soon as a reasonable offer is placed on the table.  

Many of our Legislators are seeking a "silver bullet":  a magic fix which would excuse them from making hard decisions.  If the Legislature proceeds without addressing these issues, it is my opinion that your direct involvement and leadership must be exerted to effect meaningful change.  Without your leadership, I fear we will stop short of the necessary corrective action. 

As I've said to you before, this is not a crisis for the companies writing coverage, it is a crisis for businesses and the economy of Florida.  Last week, Rep. Ross, Chair of the House Select Committee spoke repeatedly of "affordable" coverage and the creation of a subsidized JUA or state pool.  The State does not need to be in this business.  With proper solutions, the voluntary free market system of risk transfer can and will fill this need much more efficiently.
 
I stand ready to offer you my time, experience, and understanding of how to meaningfully correct this system and allow the employers, employees, and our economy to benefit.  

Thank you for your leadership and dedication to our great State.  Should you wish to discuss my thoughts, I can be reached at (941) 907-7605.

Governor Bush  -I'm hearing more and more about a statewide transfer fee
or
a "statewide school impact fee".  The Florida Home Builders are having
their
statewide convention in Tallahasse starting the first week in April. If
this
is a funding source, "given the education needs"  that you you are
interested in pursuing this would be a great time for the Florida Home
Builders to push it for you.. Although it is considered an impact fee I
believe it is broad based enough that I could lobby our association to
back
it. Let me know it this is of any interest to you.   Ron Coppenbarger

Reference: Inmate Emilio Maruri 180293

Dear Governor Bush;

Some two years ago I wrote to you about safe sex education for the inmates of 

the prison system. I received a letter from Director Moore addressing the almost 

non-existence of STD's. 

Now comes Emilio Maruri an inmate of the prison system who was transferred to 

Everglades Correctional Inst., from Florida State Prison in Stark, a transfer you 

said you were not aware of. 

In all of Emilio's health examinations, his blood work has been clean. Recently 

while in Everglades Emilio went to the Clinic and was diagnosed as positive for 

Syphilis. In the last fifteen months Emilio has been in Classification (CM 1). 

Emilio has been no where alone, always in the presence of his guard, shackled

hand and foot. Either Emilio has been contaminated by dirty needles or the

prison is conducting its own Tuskagiee Experiment. Which ever is the 

circumstance Emilio is not being treated for syphilis.

I have spoken to Mr.Don Dennis of the Prison Health Care Division and he has 

assured me that he will check into the situation and advise me of the health care 

givers response.

Thank you for your concern.

Dear Governor Bush, 

I hope the session is going well for you and the team. Wish I could be there to help you. 
Recently, I became a trustee of the South Florida Council of the Boy Scouts of America. We are having our Eagle Scout recognition dinner in May or June and would like to invite you to be the keynote speaker. We typically have 400-500 guests and recognize the South Florida Scouts who earned their Eagle Scout Award during the past 12 months. The audience is a good cross section of our community including parents of the Eagles, Scout Leaders and community supporters of Scouting. This year’s class of Eagle Scouts will number approximately 125 young men.

A formal invitation has been sent to you by mail. If you can make time in your busy schedule we will set a date that is convenient for you. I hope you can find the time to attend this event. It would mean a great deal to the boys and their families to have you address them. 

Saludos, 

Carlos Lacasa

Greetings from Brandon and Bell Shoals Baptist Church.  Our new pastor, Dr. Forrest Pollock, requested that I contact you with a question.  Tomorrow evening, [Wednesday, 19MAR03, from 6:00 until 7:00PM]  our church membership will be gathering for a special time of prayer for our country, governmental leaders and the various armed forces allied against terrorism.    His question concerns your potential availability by phone at some time during that hour - to be connected by speaker phone into our worship center.  The service will not be broadcast anywhere else and will not be publicly announced beyond the church 'family' in attendance.  His desire is to have our combined congregation specifically lift you and your family up in prayer.  If this would not present too much of an inconvenience in this difficult time, please let me know.   BSBC counts it an honor to intercede in prayer on your behalf.  

In any event, blessings my friend, to you and yours....jw

Jeb: On Saturday, April 26, the Alexander Montessori School in Miami
(near Deering Bay) is dedicating its new facilities (the Maria
Montessori Center and New Lower School Classrooms) in connection with
the celebration of its 40th Anniversary. My three children attend this
school. 
 
Beverly McGhee, the School's Director and founder, who told me that you
once visited that school, asked me to inquire of you as to whether you
could take 30 minutes of your time, if you were in Miami for the
weekend, to drop by the ceremony and make a special appearance. The
ceremony starts at 1:00 p.m. This is a big deal for the school, as there
will be some national Montessori individuals in attendance, and David
Lawrence will be the speaker at the evening function.
 
I do not like to ask you to do these things, as this has nothing to do
with your official duties, and this would be strictly as a personal
favor to me. Moreover, I know how precious your weekend time is for you
to be with your family.
 
Is this at all doable for you? If not, don't worry. Thanks!

LOOKING OUT FOR EACH OTHER

Citizens' Crime Watch of Miami-Dade County is urging everyone to adopt a ''Neighborhood Watch'' philosophy in the coming days, working in unity to protect one another and our community.

• Go out and meet your neighbors.

• Develop a ''phone chain'' directory of your neighbors so they can contact one another. Include emergency contact information, police, fire, Team Metro, your local elected officials and FBI field office.

• Indicate and identify neighbors who need additional help, such as the elderly, disabled or those with small children, and develop a plan to assist them in an emergency.

• Contact family members and develop a plan to meet should you be separated in case an emergency arises.

• Know the routines. Be alert as you go about your daily business. This will help you to learn the normal routines of your neighborhood, community and workplace. Understanding these routines will help you to spot anything out of place.

• Be aware. Be on the lookout for suspicious activities such as unusual conduct in your neighborhood and workplace.

• Take what you hear seriously. If someone's talking about plans to harm people, or you see things that don't look or feel ''normal,'' take it seriously and report it to your local law-enforcement agency.

Citizens' Crime Watch of Miami-Dade asks all of you to keep in mind that now, more than ever, you are the eyes and ears of our law-enforcement partners and of our country. With everyone's help, we can make this a safer place.

executive director,

right direction, is opening all of us to unnecessary criticisms,
friction, and waste of time, energy and money.  I totally agree with you
that checks, balances and accountability is crucial to the success of our
kids and our families.  For Lori to be the chair of a three person board,
and the executive director of the same entity is opening herself, and the
Governor to unnecessary criticisms.  People criticize even when there is

position for Lori focused on community development-especially for

Thanks God that He answered our prayers, and you are leading the DDP

I think that your proposed FCC plan is excellent.  A few suggestions  for
your consideration:
 
Self advocates for the two outlined Outreach positions.
Communicate with ADAWG/Clearinghouse on Disability on  the web page &
toll
free number. They are working on the an  accessible web page and already
have a toll free number.
DDP Staff time - consider part time OPS positions to fulfill the  duties
outlined in your plan (1) Self advocates (2) parents.  Ideally it  will
be
great if each district could hire a self advocate, or you may need  more
$
to accomplish it.
Include Direct SUPPORT workers(DSW) on training modules.  DSW are
critical for the "System of the Future".  They need to understand  the
vision, and SUPPORT (not take CARE of) individuals with disabilities  and
their families.
 
Thank you Shelly for your hard work and dedication.  PLEASE make sure  to

Berthy,
 
Thank you so much for your feedback. I added the  very important self
determination confirmation principle. I will also try to  confirm the
percent of individuals with cognitive disabilities who are  unemployed,
but
I believe your 96%  estimate is correct  (unfortunately).  I have also
added some unemployment figures from the US  Bureau of the Census 1997
survey
which indicated the unemployment rate of  working age adults with
disabilities is 70 percent. Nationally the unemployment  rate for all
working age adults is just over 5%. Only 26 percent of working age 
adults
with significant disabilities have a job or a business compared to  82
percent of those without significant disabilities. Among workers with
college degree, only 52 percent of those with severe disabilities report
labor  market activity compared to 90 percent of those with no
disability-a
gap of 38  percentage points. . The National Organization on Disability
(NOD) recently  released , The State of the State Union 2002 for
Americans
with Disabilities."  The report details the findings of a comprehensive
2001 NOD Harris Poll, which  surveyed Americans with disabilities on
their
opinions of major life activities.  The poll found that employment is the
largest gap area, with 32 percent of  people with disabilities working
full
or part time, compared to 81 percent of  the rest of the population.
 
DOE and VR play a major role in our success  to change history,
especially
since federal law requires Medicaid to be the  payor of last resort. The
DS
waiver cannot afford to pick up the slack when  other parties fail to
comply with their responsibilities. Ideally, we could cash  out those
revenues as well and let self advocates decide how best utilize these
public funds for
the purposes of their own employment planning.
 
I have  attached the FCC proposal. I don't know why this didn't attach
correctly the  first time, but let me know if you have trouble opening
it.
This is a draft so  please let me know if you have any suggestions or
concerns.

This  is excellent!  I love it, and I hope that the Governor agrees with
it!
A  few minor comments, there are now 5 principles of self determination.
The  last one is the principle of "confirmation"; people with
disabilities
are  involved in the advocacy and policy making of issues that affect
their
lives.  i.e. System redesign.  I think that the unemployment rate of
people
with  cognitive disabilities it's about 96%. Society has NO EXPECTATIONS
of
what  they can do, and unfortunately it starts with the school and it's
perpetuated  by everything else.  The Governor and DCF needs to make sure
that FDOE  change their paradigm. Special Education and VR is not helping
us.  If  they do not change, most of your effort will be short lived.

Sincerely,
Shelly Brantley, Director  of
Developmental Disabilities Program
 
 
 
Common System Barriers  for Individuals with Disabilities
 
Current disability benefits,  employment, and welfare programs interact
in
complex ways that often  discourage beneficiaries from seeking employment
and increased earnings.  People with disabilities who wish to work often
fear they will be forced to  choose between giving up benefits and
supports
and their efforts to achieve  independence through earnings. Individuals
must navigate highly complex  policies and procedures with the programs
they
currently access, and the  programs they could potentially access, to
determine a plan of action that  leads to greater independence.
 
People with disabilities, family members  and advocates often find it
difficult to make confident informed choices  about benefit options and
employment goals when faced with these  complexities. Additionally,
despite
recent reform legislation, including the  Ticket to Work and Work
Incentive
Act of 1999, there continues to be  "incentive incompatibilities" that
serve
as barriers not only to the  employment of individuals but also to the
efforts of policy makers to improve  the policies and remove the
disincentives. For example, people with  disabilities must demonstrate
how
they are unable to work because of their  disability in order to be
eligible
for SSA benefits, but once determined  eligible they are encouraged to
use
work incentives to achieve earnings  (Social Security Handbook 2001).
People
with disabilities rightfully fear  that working might demonstrate work
potential that could threaten their  continued eligibility.
 
A major source of "incentive incompatibility"  results from the fact that
both eligibility and benefit levels for many  government benefits are
tied
to earning levels. Programs such as housing/rent  supplements,
Supplemental
Security Income (SSI), Medicaid, Medicare, Food  Stamps, and TANF
(Temporary
Assistance to Needy Families) are  characterized by benefits that either
disappear or are reduced when a  beneficiary's earnings rise. The
reasonable
fears people with disabilities  have of losing disability-related
benefits
as a result of earnings, is a very  real factor in maintaining their
traditionally high unemployment  levels.
 
Almost 75% of people with disabilities remain unemployed in an  economy
that
has experienced growth in employment opportunities for all  workers.
Current
weakness in the economy is likely to drive the percentage  of people with
disabilities who are unemployed even higher. Of those people  with
disabilities who do work, the number of hours and employment 
opportunities
are significantly constricted by program eligibility  guidelines, income
limitations, asset limitations, and other complex human  service program
interactions. The evidence that nearly all individuals with  disabilities
could work, if support and environmental changes are provided,  has not
led
to the increases in employment that should have been achieved in  the
last
decade. (Nerney, 1998).
 
The US Bureau of the Census 1997  survey which indicated the unemployment
rate of working age adults with  disabilities is 70 percent. Nationally
the unemployment rate for all working  age adults is just over 5%. Only
26
percent
of working age adults with  significant disabilities have a job or a
business compared
to 82 percent  of those without significant disabilities. Among workers
with college  degree,
only 52 percent of those with severe disabilities report labor  market
activity
compared to 90 percent of those with no disability-a gap  of 38
percentage
points.
 
The National Organization on Disability (NOD)  recently released , The
State of
the State Union 2002 for Americans with  Disabilities." The report
details
the findings
of a comprehensive 2001 NOD  Harris Poll, which surveyed Americans with
disabilities on their opinions of  major life activities. The poll found
that employment
is the largest gap  area, with 32 percent of people with disabilities
working full
  or  part time, compared to 81 percent of the rest of the population.
 
Self  Determination
 
The complex array of Medicaid and welfare policy  regulations often work
against achieving real self-determination for persons  with disabilities,
a
principle central to the goal of inclusion, informed  choice and economic
and social sufficiency of people who have disabilities. 
Self-Determination
addresses the limited freedom of choice and independent  action often
experienced by individuals with disabilities in the present  health and
human services system. Self determination is dependent on five  basic
principles: freedom to develop a personal life plan, authority to 
control
a
targeted sum of resources, support to obtain personal  goals,
responsibility
for contributing to one's community and using public  dollars
wisely, and confirmation of the important leadership role that  self
advocates
must play in a newly re-designed system and support for  self advocacy
movement. Principles of self-determination establish that  people with
disabilities are the planners and decision-makers in all daily  living
activities, such as working and taking financial control of  service
resources and personal income. Unfortunately, these principles will  be
hard
to achieve without significant reforms to the current state and 
federally
funded health and human services system.
 
System Reform  Recommendation
 
We must directly address the systemic problems inherit to  both the
SSI/SSDI
(Supplemental Security Disability Income) program and  Medicaid which
present significant barriers for individuals with disabilities  seeking
employment, typical housing opportunities and other ordinary  freedoms
associated with American citizenship. As Governor of the State of 
Florida,
I would like to recommend piloting a "system of the future" which  draws
on
our unique experience with consumer directed care and current  efforts to
expand choice, freedom and responsibility through the new  Independence
Plus
Medicaid 1115 waiver authority. This recommendation will  allow more
State
flexibility and authority over the current SSI/SSDI program  as well as
Medicaid to achieve a more cost-effective system of supports  for
individuals with disabilities without disincentives to work and  barriers
to
independent living. (Please see Attachment A and B for a  summary of
Florida's Consumer Directed Care Waiver  Project and IndependencePlus
Waiver Amendment Proposal.)
 
Florida's Freedom Initiative: The  System of the Future
 
Purpose:
 
§     The primary  purpose of the proposed Florida Freedom Initiative is
to
demonstrate that  when current ceilings on income and asset limitations
are
raised, and  Medicaid funds can be used with greater flexibility,
individuals with  disabilities will overcome resistance to earning money
privately, take their  place as ordinary citizens and resolve housing and
transportation problems  more efficiently.
 
§     The second purpose is to  demonstrate more cost efficiency in the
use
of public  funds.
 
Objective:
 
§     The overall objective in  conducting this system reform effort is
to
demonstrate whether providing  additional work incentives under the SSI
program will remove potential and  real barriers to work for recipients
of
SSI benefits based on ongoing  developmental disability. Under this new
waiver program we can test whether  altering certain SSI program rules
provides effective work incentives for SSI  recipients and concurrent
SSI/SSDI beneficiaries to attempt to work for the  first time, return to
work or increase their work hours and  income.
 
§     The second objective is to determine whether  individuals who might
not otherwise work and produce income can contribute to  some of the
costs
of long term care as well as modestly increase their own  earned income.
 
Goals:
 
§     Securing broad waiver  authority under Medicaid and the Social
Security Administration to allow  those enrolled in the new
FloridaFreedom
Initiative to increase their income and assets.
 
§      Allow individuals to enroll in the new Florida Freedom Initiative
to
encourage creative approaches to housing, work and meaningful  lives.
 
§     Develop and implement an evaluation of the  new FloridaFreedom
Initiative system to determine cost effectiveness of the  increased
flexibility and reduction of disincentives to work while  increasing
opportunities to control transportation and achieve affordable  housing.
 
§     Develop and implement a statewide training  effort to maximize the
effectiveness of using broad Medicaid and Social  Security Administration
waiver authority simultaneously.
 
§      Design, develop and implement system reform for individuals  with
developmental disabilities that is cost effective, promotes the 
principles
of self-determination and can be replicated across all  disability
populations.
 
Necessary Waiver Authority to Implement  Change:
 
Florida has already participated in the most comprehensive  demonstration
of
consumer directed care including children and adults with  developmental
disabilities, aged and disabled adults, and adults with  Traumatic Brain
Injury and Spinal Cord Injury. Broad Medicaid waiver  authority and some
waivers of SSA income and asset requirements already exist  for consumer
directed care and have been successfully tested.  Floridacan  combine
Medicaid 1115 waiver authority through our Independence Plus  waiver
proposal (submitted December 12,  2003) with additional waiver  authority
from the Social Security Administration to accent those issues  most
problematic for individuals with disabilities.
 
§      Waive prohibition on room and board in order to make typical
housing
more available to individuals with developmental  disabilities.
 
§     Waive the prohibition on purchasing of  transportation including
those
individuals who cannot drive but need to  control the means of
transportation to live meaningful lives.
 
§      Waive any exclusion to pay employers directly for co-worker
support,
training costs, transportation or temporary wage  supplementation.
 
§     Waive all prohibitions on qualified  Medicaid providers except
where
appropriate for normal criminal and other  background checks. Allow
individuals to contract with faith-based groups as  well.
 
§     Waive any real or perceived prohibitions on  allowing individuals
to
capitalize very small micro enterprises up to $1500  annually.
 
It is important to note broad Medicaid waiver authority already  exists
in
Florida's current Consumer Directed Care Waiver and will be  further
expanded once we obtain federal approval for our new Independence  Plus
waiver amendment which includes the option to "cash out" certain 
Medicaid
state plan services.  However, there is still a prohibition on  room and
board payments and the purchase of certain types of transportation  under
the current Medicaid authority.
 
Conclusion: A Vision for the  Future
 
Florida's  proposed strategy for system reform is consistent with the
intent
of  inclusion and person directed support for individuals  with
disabilities.
The mere use of publicly funded programs is not the  point. The States in
collaboration with the Federal government need a  innovative,
revolutionary
and highly discretionary health and human service  system to reduce
bureaucracy, maximize public funds, natural supports and  support real
choice and empowerment for persons with disabilities. The  founders of
our
nation conceived of a community of liberty, justice and  equality. This
nation was designed so that each citizen could contribute to  the common
good and therefore have a say in the destiny of the community.  After
more
than 200 years, that vision is the corner stone of the community  we are
still in the process of creating.

Subject: class sizes


Jeb,
    I have a suggestion in regard to the class size amendent.
    Would it be possible to offer online schooling to children/families who would opt for this? This would concievably make it possible for hundreds or even thousands of students to be taught by just one teacher. For instance, here in Hillsborough county where my family and I live, one educator could teach algebra to students via webcam and interaction, reducing the need for more and more teachers. Of course, not everyone would opt for this, however, I would speculate that this would have a huge impact on class size.
If you expanded this idea, just one teacher could teach one subject to students in the entire state via computer. It seems like this would standardize each class offered. Not having to fill hundreds of empty teaching positions would make it possible to attract top notch educators to do online classes. If there were a need for only one educator per class for the entire state or even each county, I'm sure you can see the money saving possibilities.
                             Sincerely,
                             Steve in Riverview

Governor Bush,
Thank you again for the time yesterday. As per our conversation, I
wanted to
provide you with some initial information on the work Connextions is
doing
to help governments, large employers, healthcare providers, and
insurance
carriers meet the current healthcare cost and coverage crisis.
Given the costs and stress on the entire healthcare system in providing
care
for the uninsured, Medicare, and Medicaid populations, we see a real and
growing need to expand the use of medical call centers as a
cost-effective
frontline contact point. To support the balance between reducing costs
and
ensuring appropriate access to care for the patient, there are two
critical
points in time where the introduction of a licensed nurse staffed in a
medical call center can have significant impact.
The first point of contact is when the patient makes a decision on where
to
go for care. In the current environment, the emergency room has become
the
primary care facility of choice regardless of the medical condition.
Introducing a toll free number where a Medicaid patient or the uninsured
would get medical advice directly from a nurse based on approved medical
guidelines, has proven to reduce the costs associated with unnecessary
emergency rooms visits while freeing up emergency rooms doctors to
better
deal with true urgent care needs. Similar programs instituted by the VA
and
many insurance plans have seen as much as a 50% reduction in emergency
room
visits for patients who are offered phone based "triage" care.
The second point of contact is offering proactive disease management
support
for patients with chronic diseases and conditions such as diabetes,
cancer,
and cardiac illness.  Proactive contact between a nurse and a patient to
ensure the patient is taking prescription drugs as prescribed and is
being
scheduled and attending preventing testing and diagnostic appointments
can
reduce the costs of catastrophic care that result from a patient not
managing their illness properly. For example, preventing pre-mature
births
by helping a young mother with strong pre-natal care and monitoring, can
save $70,000/week in medical costs for each week the mother carries the
baby
beyond 24 weeks.
I know this is a focus for you and the team you have assigned to develop
solutions to meet these challenges. Per your suggestion, I have included
several PowerPoint slides for you to share with your team regarding
Connextions Health's medical call center solutions. As a Florida-based
company, committed both to expanding within Florida and to helping
organizations address these difficult healthcare issues, we would be
honored
to meet with any members of your team you think appropriate to discuss
the
State's specific challenges and where we may be able to help. Please
have
them contact myself directly, or our Executive Vice President, Rob
Panepinto, with any questions or additional information they may need.
Best,

Subject: Proposed cuts in Juvenile Justice



As someone who has dedicated my life to education and rehabilitation of juvenile offenders, I am very concerned about the recommended drastic cuts to the front end of the juvenile justice system. Last weekend we worked to prepare data on recidivism  for your review. I know the PACE programs did the same. My concern is for the entire "front end" of the Juvenile Justice system impacted by proposed cuts. 

Because AMI was started by concerned businessmen and community leaders we have kept recidivism data for over thirty hears. That research has driven the development of our programs and embedded the importance of relationships and education in all we do. Each of the past three years, the agency has proposed cutting services while maintaining or increasing the bureaucracy and expanding the deep end of the system.  I believe this is a direction we can not afford to continue in.  

This year DJJ made substantive changes in the methodology of their research to support flawed policy direction. No qualified researcher would support that kind of practice and in legislative hearings to date it is clear that DJJ's data manipulation has affected their credibility. Governor, in addition to running day treatment services AMI has operated programs for the most serious and violent offenders for over 20 years.  AMI's Florida Environmental Institute for Serious Offenders has long been recognized as a National model and has always ranked among DJJ's most effective programs.  We understand the need for a complete continuum. We can not, however, protect the public safety by concentrating the majority of the resources on the relatively small number of youth incarcerated. The mathematical reality is that every year the majority of offenses will come form the high risk portion of the 1.7 million 10-17 years olds who live in Florida's communities not in our juvenile institutions.  

The  risk factors for delinquency are well documented and in these tough budget times it would be fiscally prudent to focus on proven alternatives to costly incarceration.  Both AMI and PACE focus their services on youth and families who live below the poverty level and demonstrate a predominance of the risk factors that virtually guarantee they will penetrate to more expensive residential care if their challenges are not addressed.  PACE provide quality gender specific prevention programs meeting a growing need in Florida. AMI day treatment programs serve youth who have already penetrated the system and have an average of 7 charges prior to enrollment.  Both programs have long term exemplary track records of low recidivism with the populations we serve. Those numbers are in the documents you will receive and they are accurate. The majority of the youth served by AMI are minority children. These 38 AMI and PACE programs provide communities one of  DJJ's few effective strategies for relieving the problem of disproportionate incarceration of minority youth in deep end programs. It seems like the wise thing to do would be to maximize the use of these services in these difficult budget times. To anyone who has worked with these youth the DJJ proposal to replace day treatment services with State Employed Probation officers is illogical.. Almost 60% of the youth in AMI Day Treatment programs are multiple felons and  they more closely resemble the youth in low and moderate risk residential facilities that those on probation.  

. 

Governor, I believe you are getting bad advice from good people. I have tried hard to understand why. As a Senator Secretary Bankhead was a leader in supporting AMI and PACE programs. The best answer I can come up with is that your current group of policy advisors does not include anyone with sufficient hands on experience actually working with troubled youth and their families. Administering or prosecuting is not the same as providing education and counseling services that support the decision to make a positive change. I have enjoyed a good relationship with Asst. Secretary Alarcon but Florida is not California and the California Youth Authority is a quasi adult juvenile prison system getting predictably poor results. The key ingredient in a child making the decision to change is and always has been a caring adult. Good programs operate like good families with warmth, discipline, and responsibilities for each person. It is difficult if not impossible to provide the kind of environment  that relies hardware to replace caring adults. We should save those expensive approaches for the small percentage of youth we have effectively given up on. My hope is you can find time early in April to meet with me and Lawanda Ravoira of PACE and discuss these issues. 

Governor, our thoughts and prayers go out for your whole family during this difficult period in our history. Kind Regards, Bob Weaver, CEO-AMI

ON EDUCATION
A Pervasive Dismay on a Bush School Law
By MICHAEL WINERIP


MONTPELIER, Vt.

In all the world, the loneliest people must be that handful of men and
women of the Department of Education dispatched by the Bush
administration to wander the country, defending the new No Child Left
Behind Act. Talk about friendless. 

Michael Sentance, the department's Northeast representative, sat before
Vermont's joint House-Senate committee on education not long ago, and
sustained two hours of hammering by Republicans and Democrats alike. You
never saw such bipartisan contempt. He looked miserable, but as he
bobbed and weaved through the questions, this Bush appointee remained
polite and understated. "It is an audacious and challenging piece of
legislation," he conceded. "No doubt about it."

No doubt about it. Think of it from Mr. Sentance's point of view.

How do you defend a law that is likely to result in 85 percent of
public schools in America being labeled failing — based on a single
test score? Audacious, indeed.

And how do you defend a law demanding that schools have 100 percent of
their children reaching proficiency on state tests in the next decade,
and then provides a fraction of the resources state educators say is
necessary to help the poor, the foreign born, the handicapped meet those
standards?

Democrats and Republicans wanted to know. Did Mr. Sentance really
believe, given poverty's daunting effects, that 100 percent of children
could pass state exams?

"That remains to be seen," replied Mr. Sentance.

And how do you defend a law that gives the federal government
unprecedented control over "failing" schools — that tells local school
boards when they must fire their principals and teachers — even though
it pays a small fraction (7 percent) of public education costs?

Representative Howard Crawford, the Republican chairman of the House
committee, urged that the law be modified for rural states like Vermont.
And Senator James Condos, the Democratic chairman, explained why this
law was so despised in Vermont, a state with one of the most successful
testing and assessment programs in the nation. "What the federal
government is asking us to do is dump our state educational system," he
said. "That's what's gnawing at people." Senator Condos and
Representative Crawford wondered, Could the federal government be a
flexible?

Poor Mr. Sentance. His hands were tied. "Probably a lot less
flexibility than people are looking for," he said.

The Vermonters were peeved. The state already has its own fiscal crisis
— a record 40 towns voting down school budgets — and now they were
faced with this underfinanced federal mandate. The law allows up to $7
billion in additional federal aid this year, but President Bush has a
war to finance — he may need $10 billion for Turkey alone — and
could spare just $1 billion extra for left-behind children.

William Reedy, legal counsel for Vermont's education department, opened
the 669-page law to Sec. 9527.A. "Nothing in this act," it says, shall
mandate a state "to spend any funds or incur any costs not paid for
under this act." Mr. Reedy wondered, If the federal government didn't
pay what the states needed, were states freed from having to comply?

Mr. Sentance bobbed and weaved madly, but Mr. Reedy kept asking.
Finally Mr. Sentance said, "The act is paid for, and we are paying what
we should be paying for." The room went silent. A rare moment of candor.
Now they understood. Whatever the president appropriated was the exact
amount needed. There was no escape.

As I travel the country, I find nearly universal contempt for this
noble-sounding law signed last year by President Bush. Tom Horne, the
Republican state education commissioner of Arizona, and Tom Watkins, the
Democratic commissioner of Michigan, sound virtually alike in their
criticisms. The only difference is that Mr. Horne emphasizes that he
admires the president and supports his intent, it's just that many of
the details are bad.

In January, Mr. Horne flew to Washington for 37 meetings in three days
with federal officials, pleading for flexibility. He is hopeful, but has
no commitments yet. He is particularly concerned — as is Mr. Watkins
of Michigan — with the adequate-yearly-progress provision. Under the
law, to avoid being labeled "failing," a typical school must make a 5
percent gain a year on state test scores. 

But even if a school does that, it can still be labeled failing. If
just one subgroup in one grade fails to make 5 percent — poor
children, black children, limited English speakers, the handicapped,
third graders, black fifth graders — the school is labeled failing.

Mr. Horne and Mr. Watkins expect 85 percent of their schools to be
declared failing, and that, Mr. Horne said, would be a "train wreck."
Mr. Horne says schools should be held accountable, but as a
conservative, he also believes children and parents should be. Under
this law, he says, you can have a great teacher working with poor
children, and the children make two years' progress in one year, but
they still do not meet the proficiency standard and that school is
labeled failing. And you can have bad teachers at a rich school with
good test takers labeled a success. "Arizona will have good schools
punished just because they're from poor areas," he said. As for the 100
percent proficiency standard? "Definitely impossible," Mr. Horne said.

Michigan was recently informed by the federal government that even
newly arrived immigrants must take all state tests in English. Mr.
Watkins points out that Michigan's math test consists of 35 word
problems. "Is it educationally sound to give a math test and say
students don't know math when they do — they just can't read the
problems?" he said. The government was adamant. Michigan was ordered to
test in English or be penalized $1 million.

"It's time for the feds to come to the heartland and listen," Mr.
Watkins said. "They must do away with the bad and ugly in the law. It's
turning into a vehicle to bash our teachers and kids."

At the end of that two-hour hearing in Vermont, I asked Mr. Sentance
how his No Child Left Behind legislative tour was going. "The
Connecticut session went on for three hours," he said. And were they
hostile, too? "They had lots of questions," he said, before slipping
away.

Governor.  I received a letter today from your scheduling director
indicating that your schedule would not allow you to meet on the afternoon
of April 1, 2003 with members of the Florida Urban Partnership.  

You may recall that this group is comprised of Mayors from many of Florida's
larger city.  They include, Mayor Rick Baker of St. Petersburg, Mayor Jim
Naugle, Fort Lauderdale, Mayor John Delaney of Jacksonville, Mayor Manny
Diaz from Miami, and the mayors from Orlando, and Hialeah.

Would you please reconsider meeting with the group.  It has been a tradition
more or less for these mayors to meet with you, the Speaker and President
once during the legislative session to discuss city issues.  They each look
forward to the opportunity to share with you their concerns and to hear how
they can assist you with your priorities.

Thank you for your consideration.  I know this is a very busy time for you,
and would appreciate you revisiting this decision.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Our idea is to call the campaign, "Read Today. Lead Tomorrow."  The web

Governor, we received your fax re whether we should support an autism bill?  (e-mails from Susan Ross)

There is a rally in Washington today on this issue, and although Congressman Weldon was due to speak at the rally, he was unable to…but he remains very committed.
There are a few drafts in the works for legislation to address the continuing concerns regarding compensation available to children and families as a result of potential adverse side affects from vaccines. This includes children who are believed to have been diagnosed with Autism as a result of receiving a vaccine. Senator Frist has introduced legislation. Legislation has also been introduced in the House that is more comprehensive than the Senate version.
The bottom line issue is to ensure that families have a reasonable amount of time to access the Vaccination Compensation Fund. Congressman Weldon’s office is working with Senator Frist’s office to make modifications to the Senate bill.  This is all work in progress and too early to sign on yet, although we will continue to work w/ Weldon’s office.  We will continue to follow-up.  Nina.

Subject: CLASS SIZE BALONEY

My own experience for myself and with my kids is that this class size plan is pure baloney. We may be stuck with it but why not try to educate and revote the issue. Especially when all government is under budget stresses. 

This article says the same thing. The key quote is this: 

First there is the Mantra that children cannot learn in crowded classrooms.  The State of California went as far as legally mandating that classrooms at the beginning grade levels could not have more than twenty children per class.  The concept of smaller classes producing better learning for students seems reasonable. After all smaller classes mean more individual attention for students. 

The only problem I have with this theory is that it is not consistent with my experience.When I attended school we typically had crowded classrooms.  I know that we often had 35 children in a class.  We had 5 rows of seats and each rowhad seven seats.  There was rarely an empty seat.  In spite of these “overcrowded” classrooms we learned.  At the time I don´t remember being told the classes were overcrowded.  Perhaps if we knew that our classes were overcrowded we would have not done as well. 

A cynical person might look at the complaints of overcrowded classrooms as an attempt by Teachers´ Unions to increase the number of jobs for teachers.  After all simple math (something that may or may not be learned in many schools) dictates that the only way to lower the ratio of students to teachers is to employ more teachers, since we cannot reduce the number of students.In fact the more reasonable way to look at these demands for smaller classroom size is to look at it as a productivity issue. 

If teachers were able to successfully teach 35 students per teacher in the past but now can only teach 20 it means that teachers are less productive today than they were in the past.   

http://toogoodreports.com/column/general/safran/20030318.htm 

Governor: You know this is a bogus issue. Sounds good but there is no proof and it defies the past experience of many of us. I know it is a sensitive issue for you but I hope you can hold back, dissemble and bring this up for a re-vote. Especially when resources are so meager right now. 

Thanks for being accessable. 

It is late for this praise, but that Toni Jennings deal was a masterpiece. She is very respected around here. As a political commentator on WESH, she was excellent. Good move.

She was gracious enough to accept the invitation and appeared on Education Day, March 12 on the Collier Campus of Edison Community College.

Naples is abuzz with information she shared with this group of leaders, who are in turn, informing all those they come in contact with about this grave issue--reading--facing our state.  We plan on reaching the tipping point about reading in this community and we will challenge other communities to do so as well.

Thank you for engaging Mary Laura for the task of spearheading this effort.  Her enthusiasm and passion is infectious!  She is the right person for the job!

I didn't think it was really you writing me(asking for a

I called Colleen Castilla, and sent a fax to her this morning

I just wanted to say a direct 'thank you' to you for being

We're having Easter Events/Presentations on April 13th (Sunday) at

With regard to my previous message on 3-1-03 about the subject of No-Fault reform, I would like to clarify my position on that issue as I sense from your reply (see below) that you may have thought my first message implied that no one should be allowed to get a divorce. That was certainly not my intention and I trust this new message will enlighten you as to what it is I am trying to tell you.   
 
I am in agreement about marriage reform as it is most important for couples intending to marry be required to receive some kind of counseling prior to getting a marriage license. After all, one does not receive a drivers license without a certain amount of drivers education before they are given a thorough written and road test by the state.  One source which comes to mind is the Institute in Basic Life Principles (www.iblp.org ).    
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Mr. Walters, I support marriage reform rather than prohibiting divorces. We should make sure as many couples as possible understand the responsibilities in a marriage relationship before they get married.
 

Jeb Bush

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As one of many throughout Florida (and other States) who are "standing in the gap" with prayers of expectation for a restored marriage (as well as coping with lthe emotional pain of having our marriage vows "stolen away" by such an unjust system), I would greatly appreciate knowing how you can help us get something started to overhaul the No-Fault System in such a way that Due Process, Mutual Consent and Mandated Couple Counseling is included. I say this because of the following: 

1.	There were NO specific charges brought against me by my wife Cheryl since her "grounds" for the petition were Irreconcilable Differences. 
2.	There was NO way for me (or my attorney) to assemble any kind of defense against these grounds. 
3.	There was NO evidence presented to the Judge which could confirm the grounds. 
4.	There was NO way to appeal the Judge’s decision in giving Cheryl what she wanted. 
5.	There was NO way I would have agreed to "Mutual Consent" as I believed our marriage was a duly established covenant and my love for Cheryl was such that I intended to HONOR the marriage vows we made to God (and each other) on that glorious day of our wedding (8-15-82). 

Perhaps a simple solution to reforming the system (in any State) would be to just give couples a choice of either marrying under a Covenant Law System or a No-Fault System, provided they are given adequate information on the differences. I'm sure Christians would certainly choose Covenant Law since "Irreconcilable Differences or Incompatibility" would not be appropriate grounds in that kind of system, although can anyone properly define it? The No-Fault System would most likely be the choice of unbelievers. 

The only problem I see in this would be for those who were previously married under a No-Fault System since these couples would not have been properly informed as to what the consequences are should either of the two want to become a divorcer. What are your thoughts on all of this? 

Respectfully,

James M. Walters

P. S. A similar letter was recently sent to State Senator Daniel Webster (District 9) as I was informed by Katherine Spaht (President of Lifetime Marriage Institute) that he is a fellow Christian and has had a strong interest in reforming the No-Fault System in Florida for some time. In addition, I have received several messages from Michael McManus of www.marriagesavers.org which confirm her information.

30 	   chair to be elected by countywide vote shall be submitted to the 	
31 	   electors of the school district at any primary, general, or 	
32 	   otherwise-called special election, in either manner following: 	
33 	         (a) The district school board may adopt a formal 	
34 	   resolution directing an election to be held to place the 	
35 	   proposition on the ballot; or

38 	   district school board petitions signed by not less than 10 	
39 	   percent of the duly qualified electors residing within the 	
40 	   school district. The number of signatures required shall be

43 	   date the petitioning electors register as a political committee 	
44 	   as provided in subsection (3).

51 	   _____ County, Florida, I am petitioning for a referendum 	
52 	   election to determine whether the district school board chair 	
53 	   shall be elected by countywide vote." The petition shall also 	
54 	   include space for the signature and address of the elector. Each

62 	   whether the petitions contain the required number of valid 	
63 	   signatures. The supervisor of elections shall be paid by the 	
64 	   committee seeking verification the sum of 10 cents for each name 	
65 	   checked. 	
66 	         (6) If it is determined that the petitions have the 	
67 	   required signatures, the supervisor of elections shall certify 	
68 	   the petitions to the district school board, which shall adopt a 	
69 	   resolution requesting that an election date be set to conform to

79 	   of presenting the proposition to the vote of the electors. 	
80 	         (8) Any school district adopting the proposition set forth 	
81 	   in this section may thereafter return to the procedure otherwise 	
82 	   provided by law by following the same procedure outlined in 	
83 	   subsection (2).

Dear Governor Bush:  

    As chairman of ChildNet, I am proud to inform you, although you already 
probably know, that ChildNet has agreed to sign a contract with DCF, 
beginning the transition of the privatization of foster here in Broward 
County.

    In doing so, I am very proud of our board of directors, our chief 
executive officer and our administrative staff for their dedication to this 
process and our commitment, a commitment shared by DCF to "do it right."

    However, I must also commend Secretary Regier, Deputy Secretary Hadi, 
CBC/Planning/QI Coordinator David Fairbanks, and our District Administrator 
Jack Moss and his staff for their to work as partners to make this 
negotiation a success. We worked tediously and tirelessly to make 
privitization a viable reality in Broward County.

    Thanks also go to Sen. Atwater, and Rep. Rich without whose help this 
process would have been much more difficult to achieve. 

    I look forward, as does ChildNet, to continue working as partners with 
your administration and our district to make this reality truly successful.

    Very truly yours,

Mr. Governor,

    Only a moment more of your time.

    I understand "ordering of priorities" and that I fall far down the list.
BUT! -- my normal television taping is the first Wednesday of each month,
doing a series of programs back to back starting around 9am, finishing about
3:00pm.  If Wednesday is not good, then pick a day -- and the station would
probably make an adjustment.  Normally, programs are 30 minutes.  BUT, they
might agree to a special 60 minutes.  We are within minutes of your HCC
office on the St. Pete side of the Gandy Bridge.  Perhaps on one of your
unpublished work days?

    And, the conversation would carry over to my 3 radio stations.

Jeb:
 
I hope all is going very well with you. These are not the easiest times to be leading our state. As you know Robert and I are very involved with the National Alliance for Autism Research.  This is an organization that funds biomedical research into the cause, better treatment and one day a cure for autism. We are having a walkathon to raise funds for NAAR on Sunday, October 26,2003 in Key Biscayne. We normally have in excess of 5000 to 6000 people attend the walk.
 
The rate of autism is growing dramatically each year. Currently it is estimated that it affects 1 out of 250 children. For some freaky reason the growth rate is much higher certain states like Florida  and California.  As you know this cause is a very dear cause to Robert and I since our 10 year old child is autistic.  This disorder is extremely devastating to the families that are touched by it. While Robert and I are very lucky the greater majority of families afflicted by this face serious life long problems.  At this stage research is vital to find out why this happens.
 
We would really appreciate it if your schedule permits if you could attend the walk. Jeb, I would greatly appreciate anything you could do to help this cause. If you or staff need anything, please do not hesitate to contact Robert at (305) 500-9440 (office), (305) 710-1710 (cell), or (305) 669-8101 (home) or myself at 305-490-9891 (cell) Thank you

I just wanted you to know that my class of 3rd Graders are supporting our troops.  We have sent over 100 letters and watercolor and color pencil illustrations of the  Florida State Tree, Florida State Flower, Florida State Wildflower, Florida State Bird and Florida State Butterfly. These were packed in a ziplock baggie along with a sand mask sewn by a group of Florida citizens in Winter Park.
 
We are proud of pur troops and our state.  We thank you for your leadership and for making Florida an even greater state.

	I am President of  the FCCI Insurance Group headquartered in Sarasota, Florida. 

	Choosing our first appointed Insurance Commissioner is a matter of great consequence to Florida's insurance industry.   I have reviewed the qualifications of each of the candidates and investigated their reputations.    

	I believe that one candidate is clearly more qualified in terms of dealing with the many challenges facing Florida's insurance industry.  I strongly recommend that you and the Cabinet select Kevin McCarty for this very important position.

Subject:	NGA Task Force call

Governor, today’s NGA Medicaid Task Force call is intended to be an introductory call laying out goals, guiding principles and plan of action.  They asked for 1 hour….we told them, as has Rowland, that you have ½ hour.  We expect all 10 Governors to join the call.  Staff are not allowed to talk but will listen in.

You know far greater about Medicaid than any other Governor on this call.  This will not be a get into the weeds discussion of Medicaid.  But Governors do need to give staff direction.  Bob Sharpe, Alan L., Karen and I talked this morning.  We feel that there are 3 points you may want to make:

*	There is a tremendous urgency to reform….given fiscal situation of states, the war, and the limited Congressional window for any action.  (at our staff meeting there were a few D staff that clearly indicated their “concerns over the rush.”)  We need to have a product by May 1 so that Congress can take action during the summer or early fall.

*	The easiest consensus issue and first priority for Governors is the dual-eligible issue.  Congress is interested in helping Governors on this issue but the Administration has left it open, only indicating help for the very low income Medicare population.

*	There are key elements in both the NGA Medicaid principles and the Admn’s proposal that are attractive to states….flexibility, elimination of waivers…how can Governors look at benefit design to help achieve reform goals.  (We need to also have a discussion about benefit packages for both mandatory and optional populations…this is where the D’s may become very sensitive.)

House Budget Resolution----the House is getting ready to vote on a Budget resolution that we understand cuts Medicaid growth by $107billion over 10 years.  While the Committee says “growth cut” they also believe the measure will involve program cuts.  Bob Sharpe at a glance tells us that this translates to a cut of $12.5 million to Florida in the first year.  Patton wanted the Task Force to write a letter opposing the cut.  Our recommendation was that perhaps if they feel that strongly…the letter should come from NGA, not the Task Force.  He will likely raise this issue on the call.

Pls keep in mind that the Budget resolution is non-binding….it is a blue-print that Congress may use in it’s funding legislation for fiscal 04.  We strongly urged staff not to criticize at this early stage.

March 19, 2003

Dear Governor Bush:

A permit request from the City of Deltona is currently sitting in the hands
of the St. John's Water Management District Office pending approval for
immediate construction of a storm water system to provide an outlet for the
Lake Theresa Water Basin into Lake Monroe.

This permit, once approved will allow the City of Deltona to move forward
with a drainage system that will finally provide them with flood relief.
The basin has been filled beyond capacity and has no natural outfall.  Some
homes have already suffered water intrusion (flooding).  The issuance of
this permit is paramount.  In an engineering study of a worse case scenario
when the lake basin was already at 24' above sea level (three feet above
normal), if a one hundred (100) year storm event occurred more than 2000
homes would be subject to water intrusion (flooding) and an estimated $400
million dollars in property damage would occur.  Needless to say the lakes
within the basin have now risen above twenty-five feet making the worse case
scenario much more severe.  Information provided to me today indicates the
number of homes that could be impacted could reach as many as four thousand.
Even though we normally see lakes subside during the winter months, the
lakes within the chain have continued to rise, sporadic flooding has been a
continuous problem, and there is imminent danger for thousands of homes,
roads, infrastructure, and other structures to be damaged by storm water
flooding.

My reason for writing is to request once the permit has been issued that you
sign it as an emergency relief permit which would enhance the City of
Deltona to expedite construction of this lake basin outfall.  Even when the
construction is completed, the ability for the City to drain the lake system
down two (2) feet will take sixty days and that is if everything works in
their favor.  This is a serious situation and all the parties involved seem
to be cooperating.  It would be gracious of you to review this matter and
provide your signature to this permit as an emergency relief permit.
Deltona is located in Southwest Volusia County and is within my County
Council District.
Thank you for taking time to review this request.

Sincerely,


Sincerely,
Bill Long

Dear Gov. Bush and Senator Bennett,

I know you are facing a difficult job balancing the state budget, But I urge you to support generous funding for the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art in Sarasota. The Ringling expects to welcome 350,000 visitors this year----100,000 more than last year. Attendance by students and children, alone, has increased by 25% since 2000. The Ringling, one of the nation's top 20 musuems, is a cultural powerhouse that helps to drive Southwest Florida's tourist economy.During these difficult economic times, the  state taxes paid by tourists ar especially important to Florida.

I saw some waste and poor decisions. I worked with ED Gormel from the day he
came to NOTU. I was in RCA ops planning and much of his work for him. When
he was Deputy Base Commander He let all kinds of things happen the most
damaging was not bridging on numerous command changes. Every new command has
to learn the range set a program in place and transferred before completion.
Ed let them die resulting in range decay. He also left in place people that
used age as a hire/promotion factor.
The state deserves something better.
I am working ARTWG and it is important for Florida to have UAV on the range

I know you have many children to serve and I am very grateful for your

I know this placement will provide Kyle with the tools that he needs to

of
skills he needs to function at a more appropriate level for his age. By
achieving these goals Kyle will finally be the person he wants to be.

I am so happy for him and grateful to you.

Thank you so much for listening to a mother with a child in need. Thank you
for setting an example as a true public servant to people with

I hope the local district will take notice of how quickly and diligently
you
handled a crisis situation.

God Bless you and your family.

Dear Governor,
 
Of all the talks that we heard on our Tallahassee Fly-In, yours was definitely the highlight.  Thank you for taking the time to speak with us.  I am proud that you are our governor and I keep you in my prayers.  
 
My husband Mark is a Naval Academy graduate (class of 1980) and is a Captain and commanding officer of a Naval Reserve unit.  I want you to know what deep respect we have for your brother, our President.  In these troubling times, it is a comfort to know that our Commander-in-Chief is a man we can trust because he puts his trust in the Almighty.
 
It is always a pleasure to see you.  May God bless and keep you and yours until we meet again.
 
Your friend,
 
Barbara T. Rushing

Thank you for taking the time travel from Orlando to be in Tallahassee

Wednesday. As you talk with your legislators, I ask you to be a continued voice

of reason on the challenges I spoke of today THAT ultimately we will face

together. First , the medical malpractice issue is about everyone's

fundamental right to the access of care. This is an issue that has

potential to implode, it is a reality and not a political game. Second, the

workers comp issues touches us all and should be a top priority of business.

Third, I urge you to encourage our legislature to trust the marketplace and

realize the easy answer of more taxation will ultimately fail us. There

seems to be an attitude of doom and gloom here in Tallahassee, while when I

am in places like Orlando, Jacksonville, and Miami people are continuing to

be upbeat while facing everyday challenges. I thank you for your

contribution to Orlando and to the state of Florida. Please make your voice

Governor,
 
Thanks for the message. 
 
On the medical malpractice issue, I am concerned that Senator King’s position is going to doom the solution as proposed by the team (Hitt, et al). Senator King is strongly opposed to caps. A member of our delegation told me that his childhood friend is the current President of the Trial Lawyers Association and that may be driving his position. I hope that’s not true. I’m told the 62 solutions are not effective without caps.
 
I am concerned about the crystallization of positions as the House and the Governor stand in one corner and the Senate stands in another. Orlando knows you and Toni will work to move the parties closer together. Continue to trust her. She is a tremendous asset, but she is not a “yes” person.
 
I wish you were more flexible on reviewing tax revenue opportunities. There seem to be very reasonable opportunities to revise exclusions to make a significant difference. With the exception of a state income tax, I suspect the voters are less opposed to tax changes than you think they are. The video gaming seems viable to me as well, although I know very little about it.
 
My personal priorities are education, especially community colleges, and high technology economic development. While I suspect that this is, at the least, a no increase year, SCC is 27th in funding per FTE and 10th in size. Essentially, though not intentionally, we have been penalized for growth. We now must decide how to manage/limit access to stay within our means. 
With Ann McGee at the helm, we will do a great job, continuing to make you proud of us. If you are in need of a positive grounding experience, come see us. 
 
Enterprise Florida has completed a recent study on Florida business characteristics worthy of your attention. Education, and the perception of it, is a clear limiting factor in economic growth.
 
I am completing a project for the Florida High Tech Council known as Homebase21.com. Visit our website after 4/1. We are creating a website with 2 purposes, promote Florida company products/services use by Homeland Security and enable Florida companies to do more business with each other in our 21 county high tech corridor.
 
It was good to see and hear you this week. 
 
God bless you and your family.

Once again.....surprise, surprise!...there's a problem with a development
project located in Franklin County, and, being told "he doesn't know the way
we DO things in Franklin County" (speaking about an employee of the health
department) is NOT a reassuring answer to the homeowner involved! There were
no major complaints about the construction of this golf course as most
people felt it was being done responsibly, however, that has not held true.

From Franklin County's initial conceptual approval of the golf course IF it
were properly permitted, through DCA's approval of the DRI, through DEP's
permitting process, it seems that NO ONE happened to notice that one of the
golf courses' "lakes" (lake #11) was within 40 feet of a homeowner's septic
system! Did the developer deliberately mislead everyone OR was there just
not enough oversight (since, after all, this IS just poor old Franklin
County!). Of course, with all the rainfall and with the "lake" not working
properly, water has washed into the septic system and eroded the surrounding
property. (Of course, this is the SAME water that was NEVER supposed to get
into our bay, but, guess what??!!??) What is MOST reprehensible is that the
homeowner is being threatened by "having to move" her septic tank!

Now, this home has been there for 14 years...the golf course isn't even
complete...why can't the GOLF COURSE be held responsible for re-configuring
THEIR plans? They're the ones with the money! I'm quite sure that DEP would
work with the developer to make this happen since it approved the initial
permit, ANYWAY. 

Let me add, this is just ONE of the reasons people here are so very opposed
to St. Joe's SummerCamp proposal. From "row houses" being permitted in a
Coastal High Hazard Zone, to this golf course fiasco, WHY should we trust
that either city, county or state officials are really protecting the
INDIVIDUAL'S rights, rather than the DEVELOPER'S? We're afraid the same
thing is going to happen when St. Joe starts gobbling up St. James Island,
and why shouldn't we be?

I would not be the least bit surprised to see a law suit filed over this
because no one seems to be listening to the homeowner. I, personally, told
her that if she was going to file one, to name everyone from the developer,
to the county, to DCA, to DEP and beyond and MAYBE some of the stink would
stick! I HATE seeing lawyers rubbing their hands with glee over something
like this but, sometimes, it seems to be the ONLY recourse.

As usual, I don't expect a response, but it sure helps to get it off my
chest!

have a Chief Executive that communicates with the people is rare. I would

Hello Jeb:

A few weeks ago, I sent you an e-mail detailing a series of difficulties
that many graduate students are having in the Educational Leadership
Department at the University of South Florida. I would like to provide
you with a factual update:

1. Although I am currently in the program and registered as a doctoral
candidate, communication to some of my committee of doctoral professors
has been ignored. This refusal to provide me services that I am paying
for started after I contacted you.

2. Matters regarding suspect classifications were discussed outside of
the department, but not looked into within the department. In essence, I
was asked to provide very detailed information, yet no investigation
took place and no discussion took place with parties mentioned.

3. Although members of the dean's staff met with me at my request, they
acknowledged that many of the actions of professors were not
appropriate, yet refused to do anything about them other than suggest
another meeting. When I requested this meeting (twice) I was refused.

4. All of the other serious problems within this department have not
even been discussed.

It is my recommendation that a small committee of graduate students and
university staff are assembled to meet over a period of time to make
recommendations that will fix ongoing problems within this department. I
am (personally) awaiting a reasonable response from the university
regarding my personal concerns.

It is clear that I am being retaliated against for contacting you and
following university procedures to protect my rights.

Your assistance is still needed.

Thank you.

Harold (Hal) K. Nelson

But one thing is assured:  Florida companies will face unprecedented challenges – not only from U.S. counterparts but also from determined competitors from all corners of the world.

 

For Florida companies, “going global” is no longer an interesting idea…it’s essential to a firm's survival in an increasingly borderless business world.  An estimated 15,000 to 20,000 Florida firms are currently engaged in international business, but another 30,000 Florida companies have export potential.  And success is not contingent on the size of the company – in fact, the overwhelming majority of U.S. and Florida exporters are small and medium-sized companies.  

 

Why is this important to the business of economic development?  Because companies that do business abroad grow 15% faster and pay 12% higher wages than those that do not.  They are significantly more profitable, not only because diversification makes U.S. companies more resistant to domestic market disruptions and seasonal downturns, but also because international engagement tends to make a company more competitive.  Companies involved in international trade are able to test their products, price structure and marketing prowess against world-class competitors. 

 

The international growth potential for Florida companies is tremendous.  Florida already has distinct advantages in the international marketplace:  

·         its strategic geographic position;

·         14 deepwater ports and 12 international airports; 

·         a professional, financial and logistic service support sector; and 

·         a multilingual/multi-cultural workforce.  

 

The proposed Free Trade Agreement of the Americas, which will create a hemispheric free zone running from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego by 2005, could more than double U.S. / Latin American trade and no one will be in better position to benefit from this eventuality than the Florida business community.

 

How can you help Florida companies break into the international marketplace and support those already in it?  Continue support and funding for export-assistance programs, like one-on-one counseling, sales-lead programs and overseas trade missions and exhibitions.  Many of these programs are offered free of charge by Enterprise Florida, Inc. (EFI) and give businesses a risk-free chance to explore trade opportunities abroad.  EFI also maintains international development offices in Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Pensacola, Tampa, Orlando, Miami-Dade and Broward/Palm Beach, as well as a network of international offices in key markets around the world whose sole job is to help Florida companies break into global markets and increase their market share.  

 

International trade is indeed big business for Florida and we must continue our focus on this positive growth sector.

We will be receiving a formal schedule later today on the various Task Force Conference Calls/Meetings but here’s what it looks like for now:

Governors’ next conference call Wednesday, 3/26, 3:30 p.m.  This will be the standard meeting time for all subsequent Wed unless we hear otherwise or they are here in DC for a meeting.  (Tara can you block Wed 3:30, ½ hour from now through May?  Possible?)

Governors will meet in DC,April 10, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.----this meeting will be to discuss outstanding issues at the moment and include meetings w/ Secretary Thompson and Congressional Members responsible for drafting the reform bill.  (Tara---I tried for the 9th but, we were the only Gov unable to meet on the 10th…could you pls see what we might do w/ his schedule…these meetings are critical)

Governors will meet in DC, May 13-14----this is the Executive Committee meeting---the 13th is a Governors only dinner the meeting of the Executive Committee will be on Wed, May 14, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.; the Task Force will meet from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. Again the Task Force meeting will include meetings w/ the Administration and Congressional Members.  In our minds (our hope) is that at this meeting we could announce agreement on a reform proposal.

Staff meetings----staff (Karen, Bob Sharpe, Rhonda when we need her, and me) will meet twice a week for 2 hour sessions (Tues 4-6 p.m.; and Thurs 10:20 to 12:30); however, staff will meet this Friday from 10-12.

Governor----what say you about schedule?

Tara----can you give us some idea of Gov’s pending schedules so that I can let the Task Force Chair and Vice-Chair know when Gov will be participating?  Thanks, Nina

Subject: School Choice Lessons From Florida

March 21, 2003  
Florida program proves effectiveness of school choice
Children with special needs benefit from opportunity to attend private
schools 
 
WASHINGTON-A new analysis of Florida's McKay Scholarship Program for
Students with Disabilities shows that school choice provides "tangible
benefits" to students with special needs, says David Salisbury, director for
the Center for Educational Freedom at the Cato Institute. The study's
release coincides with legislation submitted by Congressman Jim DeMint
(R-S.C.) to the U.S. House of Representatives that would encourage states to
develop McKay-type programs for children with disabilities, and would allow
federal funds to be used for private or public education, based on the
parents' choices.
"School choice opponents often argue that choice will benefit only the best
and the brightest, leaving behind those children who are the most difficult
to educate," Salisbury explains in a Cato briefing paper, Lessons from
Florida:  School Choice Gives Increased Opportunity to Children with Special
Needs. However, a close look at the success of the Florida program refutes
those dire predictions. The McKay Scholarship program, which has been in
existence for three years, provides average scholarships of over $5,000 to
an ethnically diverse mix of students with a wide array of learning
disabilities and other special needs. The number of students enrolled in the
program has increased steadily, and 89 percent of the scholarship recipients
re-enrolled for the 2002-2003 school year. Similarly, private school
participation has steadily increased, from only a few in 2000 to 547 today.

Salisbury points out that in addition to providing special needs students
with a range of more effective options, the program has also benefited
public schools by decreasing class size (a legislatively-mandated goal in
Florida) without costing the school additional resources. Most importantly,
parents have a greater voice in the educational environment that best suits
their child's needs.

"The federal program under which special accommodations are made to children
with disabilities has been highly criticized," Salisbury notes. "In view of
the benefits that can be provided to children with disabilities through
increased options and choice, reform advocates and policy makers are
increasingly looking to school choice as a solution to these problems." The
Florida program provides valuable lessons for policymakers in other states
who are considering the school choice issue.

My doctors tell me I need surgery...or I'm going to need HEART SURGERY
in a 
few years...so I should get the GASTRIC BYPASS NOW, they say.  Problem,
I 
discovered that in their new contract, the school board bargained away
the 
specific procedure. I fired off a critical letter to the school board
one of 
whom is an old friend of my late mom.  I got her reply to my Feb 2nd
e-mail, 
today.  

The board claims that UNITED HEALTH has filed the paperwork with the
State of 
Florida to specifically exclude gastric bypass surgery (surgical and non

surgical treatments for obesity) from all of it's clients in the State
of 
Florida effective Jan 2003.  According to Richard Hines of the board
we're in 
the same fix as everybody else.  But United told a teacher friend of
mine in 
the same fix that the school board was the one to toss in the bargaining
chip 
to keep the costs down.  United told my friend that they are still
covering 
this procedure for other companies in Florida.  

Somebody is fudging or badly in error (typical of the M-DCPS SCHOOL
BOARD). 
Can you help me find out the truth?  I need to know so we can get a
grass 
roots movement to include this procedure in the next round of insurance 
negotiations....I'm not the only FAT educator. 

I could be in serious medical trouble with this. BAPTIST HOSPITAL
informs me 
that to pay for the procedure myself would cost (inclusive of the
procedure 
and hospitalization) $15,000.00. Thats a LOT of money.  If by some
miracle my 
Hollywood agent sells one of my literary properties, I can cover 
it...otherwise, I'm looking at a shorter lifespan.

FLORIDA REGULATORS REVOKE VIATICAL COMPANY LICENSE


TALLAHASSEE - Kevin McCarty, Director of the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation has revoked the license of a Kentucky-based viatical settlement provider, after the principals of Kelco, Inc. were found guilty of approximately 47 federal counts of fraudulent activities.

A jury found Stephen Keller, Chief Executive, and Grant Sutherlin, Vice President of Sales, guilty of fraud, conspiracy, and money laundering.  Keith Drach, Lexington-based Kelco’s chief financial officer, was found guilty of conspiracy.

Florida regulators issued an Emergency Order in July 2002 when Kelco, Inc. executives were indicted by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky.  The Emergency Order prohibited the participation of Stephen L. Keller, Robert G. Sutherlin, and Sterling Keith Drach from engaging in the affairs of Kelco, Inc.

Viatical settlements are agreements in which existing life insurance policies may be purchased by viatical settlement providers and re-sold to investors.  The life insurance policies are sold for a percentage of the face value and, upon the death of the insured, the investor collects the policy benefit. 

Kelco, Inc. investors may wish to consult an attorney to determine what actions may be appropriate.  Consumer specialists with the Department of Financial Services Helpline are available at 1-800-342-2762.  A copy of the order may be viewed on  <http://www.fldfs.com> www.fldfs.com.

Thank you sir, for your swift reply. I was wondering if you have seen the two 
letters I faxed a few days ago to Gov Bush....one addressed to me from the 
Miami Dade School Board (Richard Hines) and one addressed to an assistant 
Principal at my wife's school. The letter to the AP suggested that the 
contract with the school board excludes the procedure (does not say which 
side chose this exclusion...but does not specifically state that United 
Health Care does NOT cover this procedure for ALL of it's Florida clients).

The school board letter does in fact state that not only does United Health 
Care not cover school employees, they don't offer such surgery to any of 
their Florida clients and have registered this exclusion for the record in 
Tallahassee and done so since 2001!  On their face, the two letters are of 
such disparity that it would appear somebody is being deceptive at the least. 
 At the Governor's personal request I faxed those two letters to Betty 
Hampton a few days ago.  Can you check on this? Even if the contract does in 
fact legitimately exclude my case...it would seem that perhaps somebody might 
be held responsible for their words?  Especially if it's the school board? 

I know of many teachers who are in my own boat and are seriously considering 
a class action lawsuit given the verbiage of the two letters being so 
dramatically different...no lawsuit against the state of course!  I would 
never do that...Jeb has been very kind to me.  But a suit against the Miami 
Dade School Board might be quite likely.  Thank you so much for your help in 
this matter.

Gov. Bush,
 
I need to know how we can be ready for war when we're short of vital supplies, like protective suits and nerve-gas antidotes for first responders.
 
During Wednesday's security briefing, the consensus seemed to be that Florida leads the nation in state readiness. And yet we have only 9,400 of our 40,300 law enforcement emergency survival kits, 1,100 of the 2,500 kits required by our paramedics and only 7,000 of the 35,000 nerve-agent antidote kits for first responders.
 
I obtained these numbers from the Florida Domestic Security Oversight Board's "Domestic Security Funding Recommendations for FY2003-2004" booklet. The procurement figures were compiled in October, so I updated them yesterday with the issuing office.
 
I then wrote a story, which is at the following link: http://www.floridacapitalnews.com/legislature2003/stories/0321ready.htm
 
I pointed out that state procurement efforts are hampered by the needs of other states and the military and that they are all competing for a finite pool of equipment. By doing this, I was able to focus on the shortages without implying they resulted from neglect. Having done that, I now need to answer the question I raised in the story: how did this happen and is it problematic?
 
I hope you'll take a minute to explain this shortage to my readers - even more so as versions of my story are now being written by TV and print reporters who may not  feel the weight of there responsibilities as keenly.
 
Respectfully,
Victor Epstein
 
 
PS) My colleague Valerie Boey has already run this question by your press team.

Collegis renews two higher education contracts for nearly $10 million 

Technology used to improve teaching and learning in Texas and California 

(Maitland, Fla. -- March 18, 2003) -- Sul Ross State University in Alpine, Texas, and Mount St. Mary's College in Los Angeles have decided to renew technology management agreements with Collegis, the leading provider of comprehensive technology services to higher education.

SRSU, a public, regional university with locations in the Big Bend and Middle Rio Grande regions of Texas, signed a 5.5 year, nearly $5 million renewal with Collegis that took effect earlier this month. Even though the budget situation in Texas is dire, the value of the Collegis contract with SRSU was recognized by university administrators.

The renewed agreement at SRSU will focus efforts on implementing the IT and university strategic plans relating to technology. Collegis and SRSU staff will strive toward building stronger relationships with users, providing more opportunities for user training, building a first class Web site, and looking for creative solutions for instruction, reporting, desktop support and database management. The scope of work has been enhanced to leverage Collegis corporate resources, including NetAlert Solutions (remote network monitoring); remote Unix support for administrative applications and remote database support services.

Additionally, Mount Saint Mary's College, a four-year, private Catholic college in Los Angeles, renewed and upgraded its contract with Collegis, effective July 2003.

The new three-year, nearly $5 million agreement represents a significant upgrade over the previous contract, based on the college's satisfaction with Collegis as a reliable and efficient business partner. Collegis provides full technology management for MSMC campus operations.

Collegis, based in suburban Orlando, Fla., has more than 100 college and university clients nationwide.

Two quick thoughts.

First, the large city mayors are in Tally April 1, but evidently you
won't be able to meet with us. It's a good group and, if you can't
attend, you may want the Lt Gov to attend?  If so, your staff should
contact John Thomas (850-222-9684) of the Florida League of Cities.

Also, I've met with your DOE staff to discuss legislation to limit
liability for schools who allow joint use of their properties for
neighborhood playgrounds,etc. Per our talk I know you support it, and I
think it would help if you sent along some added encouragement to your
DOE folks.

Thanks,   Rick

My heart goes out to this father.  There is nothing we as parents would not
try to do to spare our child's life- including pleading to the President &
Governor for help.
In his letter I believe he is asking if we can intervene with the Organ
Transplant Triage & Priority system and move his daughter up on the priority
list quickly.
We do not have the ability to promise this.    It would mean that another
child and/or someone else's loved would be 'bumped' out of line

This is more an issue of their not being enough donor organs in general and
for this child, donor organs available to meet her specific needs.

We can contact the organ transplant organization and we can encourage them
to relook at this case and recontact this father to speak with him further. 
But I would imagine he is already in frequent contact with them and I am not
sure if this will help
We will can him and do our best to help him through this.

will follow up with you later on what happens

Dear Staff: 
Recently, a number of Volusia County Health Department employees have
called to complain about receiving interview requests at work or at home
from a Dianah Voyles Pulver, or her agents, of the Daytona Beach News
Journal. Please be advised that the appropriate manner to handle these
requests is through the Volusia County Health Department's Public
Information Officer. Therefore, effective immediately I am again
requesting that all staff direct all media inquires to Stefany Strong,
Public Information Officer for the Volusia County Health Department
(386)-274-0838. All requests for public records will should come
directly to me, or to our new Senior Attorney, and they will comply with
all requests promptly.  No requests for public records should go to the
VC-P.I.O. at this time. 

Also, at the request of the General Counsel's Office of the Florida
Department of Health, all employees who have received (or who may
receive) unwanted media calls should document the date, time, and nature
of the calls and submit the information to our Human Resources
Department as an incident report or as a direct complaint against such
behavior if they find such requests offensive.

We are not required under democratic law to speak with any member of the
media,  especially when such calls disrupts the smooth operation of any
department. Please understand that you are free to speak openly with any
member of the media at your home. (I am very concerned as to how any
member of the media gains access to the home telephone numbers of our
employees).  However, even in this setting, you are responsible for the
accuracy of the information which you give.  Supplying false or
inaccurate information falls under the States Discipline Policies.

Those of you who have dedicated your time and careers to public health
service realize the value of working closely with those components of
the media that share with us the health concerns of all citizens of
Volusia County.  Those elements of the media that have other
agendas.....well.....report these contacts to the P.I.O.

Thank you very much for your excellent work and dedication to providing
the best possible quality public health care to the citizens of Volusia
County. You are making a positive difference in improving public health
in our community.

Dear Governor Bush,
Dr. Carol Stewart and I were thrilled when Senator Fasano invited us to
join the Pasco County Senior forum to see you!  Your words of concern to
them were certainly kind, sensitive and informative.

Our primary focus of significance NOW is our nation during this time of
war.
Out of respect to our State affairs, I inform you of my "progress" in
Tallahassee.
Dr. Stewart and I were able to confirm that the Autoimmune Center had
met our objectives for the State and Medicaid by providing easy
efficient care and having the ability to avoid and having avoided
catastrophic illnesses, unnecessary drugs and 51% misdiagnosis..  One
patient we took off dialysis, a patient about to lose their children to
the State and threatening to commit suicide, and NUMEROUS patients
spared kidney and lung transplants.
Mr. Paul Belcher spoke with Mr. Bob Sharp after our meeting.  Mr. Sharp
CONFIRMED my report and stated he was putting the Center in the AHCA
budget for 2003 and asked for continued.  Mr. Belcher caught up with us
later with this news, and guided us toward further appointments.  It was
a pleasure and honor to speak briefly with Mr. Mike Hansen.  He is just
TOPS! I spoke with Health Appropriations committee members, Majority
Whip of Senate, Aides of Speaker of House and Senate President, and
StephanieMassengale.

Governor, I came to Tallahassee sacrifically to serve the underserved in
Florida while providing cost savings care to prevent live threatening
afflictions.  I had to be cleared by the Head of Ophthamology, UF,
Monday morning at 8:15 a.m. to travel. to Tally.  I have been returned
to bed for the next four days and will know MOnday if surgery is needed
for my cornea.  I have no regrets.   I believed that what I could offer
in education and FACTS would help one in five citizens of our State, and
thus worth the price I might have to pay.

May almighty God who is the creator and redeemer of humankind bless and
keep you and those you love in these difficult days.  May God who is the
Father of the Prince of Peace bring peace to our world.  May God show us
the way to a true peace with justice for all people.
Keep the faith,

House panel backs faith-based office 
By Mary Ellen Klas, Palm Beach Post Capital Bureau
Wednesday, March 19, 2003
TALLAHASSEE -- In spite of looming budget cuts that could dismantle dozens of social service programs this year, a House committee Tuesday approved legislation that will spend $700,000 to create a new office for faith-based initiatives next year.
The House Committee on the Future of Florida's Families voted 16-0 to create the program at Florida A&M University here to provide training and technical assistance to help faith-based groups provide secular services in Florida, said the bill's sponsor, Rep. Frank Peterman, D-St. Petersburg.
The bill, HB 837, calls for the program to be administered by a not-for-profit organization called the Florida Families Faith-Based Institute Inc. The institute's board would be appointed by the governor, the Senate president and House speaker. Its adviser, the bill says, will be Bethel Missionary Baptist Church of Tallahassee, run by the Rev. R.B. Holmes, a FAMU trustee and a longtime supporter of Gov. Jeb Bush.
The $700,000 earmarked for the first year would come from the existing budgets of several state agencies as well as federal matching money, Peterman said. The FAMU program would help train faith-based groups in skills such as accounting and management.
"Often times when the money comes down, they are not equipped to handle some of the managerial pieces," said Peterman, who is also pastor of the Rock of Jesus Missionary Baptist Church in St. Petersburg.
The proposal dovetails with the goals of the governor and his brother, President Bush, who created the White House Office of Faith-based Initiatives in 2001 and made $200 million in federal grants available to states. Both have said they believe that government has a role in helping faith-based groups carry on their social services ministries.
In December, Gov. Bush hired an Orlando-based Christian group for $80,000 to find volunteer mentors to help school children study and he said he was considering establishing a new position in his office to coordinate marriage and faith-based initiatives.
Holmes said he pursued the legislation to help Florida get some of the federal money and he believes his church's success in developing a wide range of community services, from charter schools and low-income apartments to a soul food restaurant and a family life center, can be a blueprint for success.
"Because of the president's initiative, we felt it was time for a credible organization to say here's how to bring the players together," he said. "This model can be emulated across the state."
But Holmes' idea was criticized by the director of the Florida Faith-Based Association, a coalition of faith-based groups that formed last year to establish a network to help draw down federal money to Florida.
Bernie DeCastro said neither Peterman nor Holmes contacted the association, and he questioned whether they could deliver.
"They're starting from scratch on what has taken us a year to develop," DeCastro said.

Dear Governor Bush:

I am writing to let you know that the television show is finally completed. I know it took longer than we had anticipated, but I think it will be worth the wait. 

We are planning on presenting to the Florida PBS stations on April 14, 2003, to determine which stations will air it and when. I know this is not a good time with the session and war, but would it be possible to get a letter of support from you to put in our package to the stations? We can get you a draft of the letter to avoid having your staff have to create one. Please let me know if this would be possible. Also, I would like to send you a copy of the tape to watch. Could you let me know the best way to get it to you? I didn't want to just send it to the capitol address (unless it would be sure to get to you directly). 

Thank you again for your support in this project and let me know at your earliest convenience how to proceed.

Thank you, Governor.  We look forward to hearing from you.  
 
To follow up on our meeting on January 14, I am enclosing FYI a copy of the “PARTNERSHIP AND SECURITY INITIATIVE: Caribbean Ports, Tourism and Trade Security Training” Proposal that FAVACA sent to Senators Graham and Nelson’s staff on February 25.  This project would be funded under the FY04 Foreign Operations budget.  The objective is to improve security in Caribbean ports through training and technical assistance from Florida ports and tourism security experts.  Such assistance will have a two-way impact, making travel, tourism and trade safer in the region and in the United States.
 
On a personal note, we send you, your family, and President Bush our prayers and warm best wishes during these difficult times.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
The Florida Association for Volunteer Action in the Caribbean and the Americas (FAVACA) will send you an official invitation next week to present the awards at our annual Outstanding Volunteer Achievement Award reception at the FSU University Center Club on Thursday, April 24 at 6:00 pm.  FAVACA is honoring this year 10 outstanding volunteers from throughout the state, a record number.  Other reception attendees will include members of the Florida Legislature, representatives of Florida-based corporations, international business leaders, the media, and members of FAVACA’s prestigious Board of Directors and Advisory Council.  It should be an exciting evening. 
 
We would be delighted if you and Mrs. Bush saved this date in your busy schedules.  We would also appreciate if you could let us know ASAP if you plan to attend, as the invitations must be printed before Tuesday, March 25th.   I have already asked Pam Dana to reserve this date. 
 
Governor, we hope to be honored with your presence and thank you again for your continued support.  I also anticipate running into you again at the Sunset Theatre in South Miami one of these weekends, and hope that Mrs. Bush enjoyed the Frida book and CD that I delivered when we met in your office on January 14.

Mr. Bush,
 
Thank you for your email.  This trip to Tallahassee was quite educational,
and you are right, doom and gloom seemed to be a consistent theme throughout
the day.  Blame was as well.  It was blame on this party or that party, or
the blame on the House or the Senate.  (It all depended on your position.)
Politics at it finest!  One excuse after another.  
 
I sat patiently and listened to each speaker.  I took many notes, and I have
followed up with letters.  My expectation is low that the points and issues
I raise will be used to build a case and ultimately become a potential
solution.  In fact, my expectation is that my messages will fall on deaf
ears.  
 
For example, during our time in Tallahassee, House Representative, David
Simmons came to see us as well.  I believe he needs a clearer focus on the
real issues of healthcare.  These were his four areas of focus in the next
40 days:  
1.)        "Meaningful" Tort reform (Would someone please define
meaningful?)  No doubt Tort reform is necessary.
2.)        Insurance caps (I have a deep desire to get clarification on what
this cap would be, considering the lobby for insurance companies is one of
the most prominent in Tallahassee.)
3.)        "Changing the jury from those with tattoos to those who vote."
Good Lord!  Who voted for this guy?  He calls himself a US Citizen?  I would
classify him more as a bigot.    
4.)        Attorney advertising - Placing limits on those large
advertisements directed to prospects who have had the misfortune of an
accident.  (Didn't we the people at some point in history vote for freedom
of speech?)
 
I responded to Rep Simmons, and he suggested I contact my representative.
Do you have goosebumps?  I wanted to scream. He clearly doesn't get it.  
 
The state of our Healthcare issues are horrific.  As I am certain this will
not be the first invitation, but I would like to personally invite each of
the appropriate Senate and House health related committee members to come
and see both the good and bad in healthcare.  You have seen it, and I
commend you on your efforts to be in the face of our citizens, as a good
Governor should.  It is our, lame, uneducated healthcare committee members
that concern me greatly.   The only representative I have seen in a hospital
setting is House Representative, Randy Johnson, and yet he is not on any
health related committee.  Maybe you can put a bug in some of these
representative's ears about taking more action in the area they are
representing.  It would certainly be appreciated.
 
I have been in healthcare for 17 years.  I have seen patients in the
physical therapy arena.  I have dealt with supplying hospitals and home
health agencies with equipment to better serve patients.  I have worked in
administration for an orthopaedic practice.  I have managed an orthopaedic
and neurosurgery department at a hospital.  I have contracted with managed
care organizations.  I have even been a representative for the hospital as a
physician liaison.  I now work with Dr. Rippe in the area of Executive
Health Assessments.  (Surely you know about this, as I understand you will
be coming to see Dr. Rippe very soon!)  The list goes on and on.  Suffice it
to say I know what is going on in the trenches.  I'm worried about the
future state of healthcare.  I am not sure how contributing time to help
would actually accomplish anything considering the tone of our
representatives.
 
I welcome your advise on how I might better assist in meeting these serious
challenges with forward momentum thinking in lieu of status quo.  Thank you
for coming to visit us while we were in Tallahassee, it was an honor to meet
you.  You are doing a great job.  May God be with you in these trying times.

 
 
 
Sincerely,

Thank you for taking the time travel from Orlando to be in Tallahassee

Wednesday. As you talk with your legislators, I ask you to be a continued
voice

of reason on the challenges I spoke of today THAT ultimately we will face

together. First , the medical malpractice issue is about everyone's

fundamental right to the access of care. This is an issue that has

potential to implode, it is a reality and not a political game. Second, the

workers comp issues touches us all and should be a top priority of business.

Third, I urge you to encourage our legislature to trust the marketplace and

realize the easy answer of more taxation will ultimately fail us. There

seems to be an attitude of doom and gloom here in Tallahassee, while when I

am in places like Orlando, Jacksonville, and Miami people are continuing to

be upbeat while facing everyday challenges. I thank you for your

contribution to Orlando and to the state of Florida. Please make your voice

serve in your administration.  However, at present I
do not believe that I am contributing all that I can

your administration.  I wonder if you might ask your

Governor Bush,

I would like to help resolve the conflict between any decisions made by the
Collier County government and the State's efforts to purchase land in
Southern Golden Gate Estates for the Everglades Restoration Project.

Unfortunately, I cannot attend the meeting with you and your Cabinet on
March 25 because: (1) we have a regularly scheduled Commission Meeting and;
(2) our legal counsel has advised us of a possible Sunshine Law conflict if
more than one Commissioner attends the meeting. Consequently, Commissioner
Coletta, whose district includes the land in question, will be representing
the Collier County Commissioners.

Although the issues apparently involve a number of agencies, including the
Judiciary, Property Appraiser and the County Commissioners, I will do what I
can to resolve these conflicts.

When you appointed me 16 months ago, I promised I would not disappoint you.
I intend to keep that commitment. Please let me know what I can do to help.

Governor Bush:

First, please accept my very belated congratulations on your
re-election.  As you can imagine I was pleased, but never in doubt as to
the outcome!  We all look forward to the continuing four years and
beyond.  

You've been so responsive and helpful to me in the past; I wonder if I
may come to you for guidance once again.  The communication below
broadly describes an escalating event that we believe offers significant
economic harm to Florida business, specific to international trade.
Melissa Freedman has worked very hard to develop a dialog with U.S.
Customs; however, the solution they have extended to her is, in our
opinion, not a solution at all, and, once deployed, irreversible; the
damage to business irreparable.  We have also attempted to reach Dr.
Dana but understand her office does not work with these issues.
Perhaps we do not understand the proper avenue of communication...

Can you please describe to me the most effective and concise method to
use to earn your attention on this issue, so that you can then review
and determine if it is meritorious enough to earn the resources of your
staff?

We are a constituent company with offices in Miami and Tampa; our client
base is global, with nomenclature including thousands private and public
entities.  I am happy to provide whatever information may be of use in
determining the merits of our case.

Your comments and questions are encouraged; thank you in advance for
your consideration.

24-Hour Rule and Manifest Confidentiality

		Hello Melissa:

		Thank you for your time this afternoon and especially
for your willingness to expedite this matter for us.  The attached link
to the Federal Register identifies the deadline for public comment as
Monday, February 10, 2002.  As a constituent business with offices in
Tampa and Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, we request advocacy from your office:
specifically, submission of a letter in response to the Federal Register
notice for public comment.  A sample or template of suggested copy is
attached for your review and consideration.

		Here are the most critical discussion points:

		Economic Harm to Florida Business:    In addition to
severely restricting the marketing, economic development, competitive
intelligence and strategic planning activities of Florida business
engaged in international trade, the proposed ruling will restrict the
decisioning tools of foreign companies who use this data to identify
potential Florida business counterparts, or key traffic areas for site
selection and plant expansion.  

		Business interests include but are not limited to
manufacturers  (chemical, equipment, hardware, textile, etc.),
pharmaceutical companies, NVOCCs, banks, railroads, freight forwarders,
custom house brokers, trade development agencies, importers and
exporters, and law firms; example:  the Florida Ports Council uses this
data in developing and implementing economic and business development
initiatives vital to the growth of international commerce in Florida.  

		Duplication of an Effective, Existing Law:  The proposed
ruling duplicates the Trade Act of 1930 that contains an automatic
system for protecting the confidentiality of the identities of importers
and consignees.  See 19 C.F.R. § 103.31(d)(1); 19 U.S.C. §
1431(c)(1)(A).  It also contains a procedure to bar publication of
manifest data about a particular cargo shipment whenever the Secretary
of the Treasury determines that publication may harm national security,
or may cause personal injury or property damage.  These well-established
procedures strike the balance between preserving national security,
facilitating public disclosure of manifest information, and enabling
parties interested in doing so to protect their confidentiality.
		The current rule for biennial confidentiality
certifications works well, with more than 1,200 exporters and 1,700
importers making use of the biennial confidentiality certification
procedure.  During the 22 years that the current rule has been in
effect, the confidentiality provisions have generated very few
complaints from those that file confidentiality certifications, and
PIERS is frequently in contact with Customs' Disclosure Law Branch to
ensure that shipper confidentiality is maintained.
		Undermining of Congressional Policy; No Credible
Contribution to Port Security:  This proposal originated in response to
comments filed in the rulemaking proceedings for the "24 hour rule" - an
initiative designed to increase port and maritime security.  Yet,
reducing the amount of vessel cargo information released will not
increase security.  It will, however, seriously harm trade and law
enforcement activities that rely extensively upon the availability of
this information through PIERS and other information services. 

		Florida clients who have submitted letters of support
for our position include the Greater Tampa Chamber of Commerce and the
Florida Ports Council.

		Your comments and questions are encouraged.  For
additional information or clarification:

Governor, when you were here in Orlando this week, the local media had a clip where you mentioned, again, your concern for our National Guard families.  We are so fortunate to have a project in Central Florida called Operation Home Fires.  

As our 2d BN (Orlando armory) pulled out early in January, Robert Stuart called us, at the suggestion of MG Harrison, and asked to partner with us to support our families -- to keep the home fires burning.  He is the Executive Director of the Christian Service Center, a coalition of some 130 churches in the Orlando area that provides, among other things, emergency services for families in need.  Recognizing the disparity some families will feel with this deployment, he felt it was the community's responsibility to step up and help.  It is his intent that our families "be treated with honor," and he doesn't hesitate to say so.  He organized an event on March 4 to announce OHF to the community.  MG Harrison, David, and our Brigade Chaplain spoke, and I served on a panel representing the Family Readiness system.  Media coverage was outstanding, and continues this far out.  FOX 35 did a story this week, and a citizen who refurbishes bicycles called to donate 35 bicycles to military children.  OHF is not just for National Guard, families from all services are welcome.  

Our National Guard families who have emergency situations -- or suffer from economic distress -- are processed through the Family Readiness Center at the Orlando Armory, then referred to OHF staff.  Robert has designated a (wonderful) full-time person to handle the project, and he is out to raise $80,000 from area churches and other sources to fund the initial needs; however, this is a faith-based effort and prayer and fellowship and encouragement are also offered to the families.

Go to www.operationhomefires.org for more information.  There is also a great brochure I can send you.  David and I have been friends with Robert and his family for many, many years.  David's mother worked for Mr. Stuart before he was born, they are all Sigma Chi's, and I worked (as a Republican!) for George when he was a Senator.  OHF and the National Guard is a strong partnership and a wonderful resource for our families.  I only wish we could take it statewide to help the other families from the 53d Infantry Brigade.  David has about half of the Brigade either in theater or waiting at Ft. Stewart, about 2000 soldiers.

This is a great program, and I just wanted you to know about it.  Have a great weekend!  Hope to see you in Tallahassee for National Guard Day, April 1.  I gave your new Lt. Governor (good choice, by the way) a Minuteman pin to wear that day!

Dear Governor Bush,
 
We are writing today to urge you to create a legacy for future Floridians by setting a standard of 10 ppb phosphorus for the entire Everglades, without exceptions.  Adopting such a rule can preserve miles of Everglades sawgrass that are rapidly being replaced by cattails unsuitable for wildlife.  We are concerned that some sugar industry representatives might falsely argue that the number should be higher or that you should approve "relief mechanisms" that would actually surpass the 10 ppb standard.  These assertions are neither supported by science nor backed by public opinion.  The public understands that 10 means 10, everywhere.  Please do the right thing and set the standard at 10 ppb.
 
Sincerely,
Kimberley Hunt and

Dear Governor Bush, 
How have you been? I have been busy with school. But I have been watching about you and watching President Bush's speeches. I hope you have a nice trip to Orlando on Thursday. 
After September 11, I watched you on TV telling people that Florida was a safe place to be so they should come here. I also saw President Bush tell everyone to travel, buy a house and a new car and go shopping. Me and my aunt did all of that, we got a new house and a car and loved shopping too. 
Now I am confused, I have been watching about the war with Iraq and they talk about terroist coming here again. But my friend Sheriff Beary got on TV and said Orlando is safe and he is helping to keep Disney safe. My law enforcement friends in New York City say that is safe too. I am going there soon to give them vests. But I was suppose to go to Disney on Friday with my school and some of my friends were going to New York with school and some were going to Washington Dc with school.  I have been to both of those places too and they were safe when I went. Today the all the schools canceled all the field trips because they said with the war we wouldn't be safe. I don't understand, you and President Bush say don't be afraid go do what you want and the school says we won't be safe at Disney or New York or Washington. Can you please explain to me?

Governor:

I am also trying to schedule some time with Commissioner Horne, I also want
to share with you some thoughts privately.  I know your time is limited, I
also do not want to put too much in an email.

I want to be able to best use my ability to serve you, I have some ideas,
but I am not a bureaucrat and I do not play internal politics very well.  I
do pretty good on the outside with politics.  But inside political games are
just not my forte.  I just assume everybody wants to work together and get
your vision accomplished. Unfortunately, I think too many folks have their
own agenda's. 

You have always been so open, and I am just comfortable sharing these
thoughts with you.  I know you have given wise advice to many others, but my
biggest mistake was staying at the DOE, rather than returning to the
Capital. But all I wanted was to make problems go away there and serve you.
There were many.  I think you will finally begin seeing some of the fruit of
our labor with some upcoming studies, most of this was pushed because of my
personal contacts.  The leftwing PFAW bashes, we counter with studies coming
out from Cato, next up Heritage and then Jay Green and the Manhatten
Institute.  Reason will chime in soon as well.
                   
My commitment is to you, and I want to share some ways I think that would be
very possible, allow me to remain in Tallahassee and give me some meaningful
work on education reform. (I also want you to write an education reform book
and I want to help!) I seem to have a gift to see things long term, take the
complex and break it into understandable simple terms. I think that is why I
enjoy policy work.  I would even consider something else in your
administration.  But children and education are my passion. I just want to
know where you think I best fit into the plans.

There never seems like a good time to catch you, and email is always
convenient for both of us. 
Make it a great weekend. 

All the Best! JC

Subject: FCAT issues



February 12, 2003

 

Mr. Jeb Bush,

 

I have never been one to get involved in the political realm other than consciously voting during every election.  As a public school employee, I feel it is time to speak my mind.  It is my hope that Mr. Bush himself will take the time to read this letter.

 

My daughter, Sarah, is probably one of the hardest working students you will ever meet.  She is the type of young person who pushes herself to the limit, studying nightly till 9:00 p.m. or later to make sure she gets the best grades possible in school.  As you know, she and her fellow students are now required to pass the FCAT in order to be awarded a high school diploma.  This is a requirement she, and many others, will probably never meet.  It isn't because she isn't trying.  She visits the FCAT Explorer site daily, has two tutors, and stays after school four days a week for additional help on the test.

 

Depending on the report you study, Florida ranks somewhere between 48'TH and last in its high school graduation rate!  What are we thinking?  I fully understand the need to raise educational standards and have always supported doing so until the FCAT requirement.  It is a crime for a good student to attend school for twelve years, earn 24 credits, hold at least a 2.0 grade point average and then walk away without a high school diploma because of a single test!   It appears to me that we are leaving quite a few young people behind!

 

Obviously, as a teacher, I am a believer in the public school system.  I have learned that private schools are not required to give this test.  I would guess that most of our legislators probably send their children to private schools.  However, for most of us, this is not an option.  Have you and our legislature taken the time to closely examine the FCAT?  My guess is no.  I doubt seriously that most of our legislators could earn a passing score on the test.

 

Again, I understand the need for standards.  Not all students are college bound, but all students are required to attend high school.  I have no problem with entrance exams at the college level, but to deny our young people a fair beginning in life is just unfair!  I wish you could meet Sarah and the thousands of students like her.  This next week will be a particularly difficult time for each and every one of them as they take the FCAT.  Many will simply give up!  

 

I honestly believe that the State of Florida will pay dearly for our poor graduation rate.  In ten years there may not be enough prisons to hold all our young citizens who were doomed from the beginning of their adulthood when they were not awarded a high school diploma.  Please carefully consider this letter.  There are literally thousands of parents who feel the way I do.  Let's find a better way to educate the State of Florida's youth!

 

I eagerly await your response to my thoughts...

 

Respectfully,

Jim Way

E-mail:   <mailto:xlh83@earthlink.net> xlh83@earthlink.net                

 

Dear Mr. Way:

 

Thank you for taking the time to write Governor Bush regarding your concerns over the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test (FCAT) and high school graduation.  Your correspondence has been forwarded to me for response. 

 

In 1994, the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test (FCAT) was designed by teachers, testing experts, and Department of Education staff to measure student learning based on the Sunshine State Standards (SSS).  The standards identify what students should know by grade level in seven subject areas.  (If you would like to view the SSS, you can find them at http://www.firn.edu/doe/cgi-bin/doehome/menu.pl.)

 

If our educators are teaching to these Sunshine State Standards throughout the school year, then the FCAT should not require additional preparation.  The FCAT is merely an assessment of skills taught in the classrooms.  Therefore, teaching to the test should be a result of the teacher's normal curriculum, which is based on the Sunshine State Standards.

 

For more than 20 years, Florida has administered a high stakes "exit" exam in order to determine a student's eligibility to receive a regular high school diploma.  Prior to 1999, a passing score on the High School Competency Test (HSCT) was required to graduate from high school.  Since 1999, the grade 10 FCAT has served as the required "exit" exam.  

 

Students must earn a passing score of 300 on the grade 10 FCAT to receive their diploma.  This passing score was set based upon the recommendation of teachers.  Students are given up to six opportunities from the 10th to 12th grade to achieve this passing score.  

 

Governor Bush holds Florida's children dear to his heart and will do everything possible to ensure that every child receives a high-quality education.   Thank you again for taking the time to contact our office.  Please feel free to contact us with further issues of concern.

 

Sincerely,  

Patricia W. Levesque

Education Policy Coordinator

 

My Response to MS. Levesque and you...

 

Ms. Levesque, 


I am well aware of the history of the "high stakes" exit exams.  I have also taken the time to familiarize myself with the FCAT and the SSS.  I'm not sure read my letter carefully.  I hope you never have to take the comprehension section of the FCAT.  While I realize Mr. Bush is a very busy man, it was my hope that he might actually read the letter! 


It is my belief that the vast majority of "teachers" are not as supportive of the FCAT as you and the legislature might have us believe.  You state that teachers should be teaching the concepts on the FCAT.  I agree.  What I don't agree with is the statement that if they are, there is no need for additional help.  If that is the case, what is the point of the FCAT Explorer web site?  Why are there grant supported after school programs springing up everywhere?  Why are over forty percent of our high school students not graduating? 


In your words, "the FCAT is merely an assessment of skills taught in the classroom."  If only that were true.  Then we could use the test to help students, not deny opportunity for a regular diploma!  I wonder how many of you would be willing to take the FCAT under the same high stakes?  Would you be willing to resign your position if you did not pass?  


I hope to find some way to talk directly to Mr. Bush.  If, as you say, Florida's children are dear to his heart, maybe he will take the time to listen to parents with legitimate concerns, not simply have someone reply restating what we already know... 


Respectfully, 

James Way

Many thanks for looking into this. Certainly understand the position the State is in relative to the deficit.  I would only ask that those looking at the cuts keep in mind the established quantifiable link between the media efforts and reductions in prevalence.  Few programs can show such a solid track record of delivering the ROI of this effort.

 

Hope to see you down this way soon. All the best.

our problem is that the tobacco funds have been reduced (ironically because of the reduction of tobacco use) leaving us with a problem this year. We are struggling with an obligation by law to reduce the deficit. I have resisited for three years the reduction of funds for your program. Now I don't know if we can keep it up for this fiscal year.

Governor Bush,

 

I am e-mailing you today with respect to the continuation of the successful Truth anti-tobacco media program. You have been our most stalwart supporters of this use of a small portion of the tobacco settlement funds received by the State of Florida. 

 

Given the State’s shortfall of funds, DOH has asked us to cease this program for the remainder of the fiscal year. Without any media, especially during the school year, there is no way to keep up the awareness necessary to sustain the State's investment in this program. DOH’s independent studies of Truth have noted the impact of media and its efficacy above all other components at reducing youth prevalence. 

 

We understand the need to prioritize in these times of budget shortfalls. We would suggest that the total shut down of a program, that works as well as Truth, is more akin to throwing out the baby with the bathwater. 

 

We appreciate anything you can do to help us help the State sustain its important investment in this demonstrably effective program.

Ormond Beach, FL 32176  
March 3, 2003       
    
Palm Beach and Volusia Legislators:

    Please have the following inserted in  Florida Statute Chapter 121 in 
2002-3:     “”For all former members of the Teachers’ Retirement System, who 
lost membership because contributions were withdrawn or because Florida 
teaching was not resumed for five or more years before 1970 and who returned 
to teaching as a compulsory member of the Florida Retirement System, the cost 
for purchasing TRS out-of-state or federal service will be determined by 6% 
of salaries earned for the years of service at the time membership ceased.  
All rights and benefits under the Teachers’ Retirement System will be 
restored and pension will be calculated at 2% for each year of service. This 
right and benefit are retroactive to date of retirement and before the first 
retirement check was issued and cashed.  An application for such teaching 
service must be applied for to the Division of Retirement after June 1, 2003 
and adjusted payment will begin on July 31, 2003.”  
    In 1997, when Robert C. Heath retired from 22 years of teaching in Palm 
Beach and Volusia Counties, Mr. A.J. McMullian III denied ten years of full 
retirement credit, because of a Florida Retirement System enacted in 1970.  
McMullian, in a contrived informal hearing at the Division of Retirement 
Offices, refused teaching credit for teaching in Heidelberg American High 
School, which the Teachers’ Retirement System grants, and only allowed seven 
years of Palm Beach service at 1.68% instead of 2% per year, which is 
mandated under the Florida Teachers’ Retirement System.
Dr. Heath is appealing to the Florida Legislators and Gov. Bush to amend 
Florida Statutes, Chapter 121, to raise his short changed pension to the 
correct pension promised before and after 1970 and protected by Ch. 121 for 
Ch. 238 benefits.                   Respectfully yours,

January 31, 2003

Governor Jeb Bush

State Capitol

Tallahassee, FL 33801

 

Dear Sir,

Please let me thank you for taking the time to read this letter, and hopefully reflect on this rather desperate and sad situation. I know that you must receive a tremendous amount of correspondence such as this. And I want you to know that I do appreciate you and the awesome job you do for all Floridians living in our beautiful "Sunshine State".

My heart and two beautiful, innocent little boys, (my Grandsons), have led me in the direction of writing this very important letter to you. The person whose behalf I am writing this letter has no idea that I've written, nor any idea that I am prepared to beg you to save his life!

The name of the young man whose life I am appealing to you in behalf of is Eric Newman Westbrook. He is currently incarcerated at the prison located in Lake Butler, Florida. Eric was engaged to my daughter (Ericka) and together they have two darling sons, ages 2 and 3. Eric was recently diagnosed in prison with a very serious and deadly form of brain cancer. He has had (reports are sketchy at best) a couple of operations and currently radiation treatments are supposed to be taking place. The doctors in charge of Eric told the family that the cancerous tumor has been in his head for a couple of years. He had horrible headaches more than likely caused by the tumor, in the spring and summer of 2001, months before he was arrested. The headaches grew worse most times unbearable during his year in the Polk County Jail. During this time it had grown and now completely covers his brain and is attached to his spinal column. Herein lies the problem that I, and a lot of other people are having with this horrible situation. Along with many other symptoms common to this type of brain cancer are erratic, irrational, and totally not normal thinking and behavior. Eric is a fine young man and a terrific father. I really believe that this tumor clouded all rational thinking when his cousin talked him into participating in the burglaries.

Eric was charged with several burglaries and other various counts relating to the burglaries in December 2001. He was immediately taken into custody with bond set too high for him to be released. He sat in the Polk County jail suffering with these terrible headaches (at times so excruciating the skin around his eyes would turn black & blue) for which his family sought treatment every visitation day that he seemed not well. No treatment was given until the tumor had taken over his entire skull and he started passing out. This was over a year later. And unfortunately for Eric this happened after sentencing. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison with 10 years probation to follow upon leaving prison. The sentencing was in November, 2002.

When Eric was first arrested on these charges, I was deeply upset and disappointed in him. Truly finding what he had done unbelievable. Eric loves his family and I had a very hard time dealing with the whole situation. If Eric is totally responsible for his actions, my daughter, the children and the rest of his family will have to live with the sentence and without him. But my heart keeps telling me that if the Judge had known about Eric's terrible cancer, he would not have been sentenced so harshly, if at all, knowing that the brain tumor most assuredly clouded his judgement!

I've prayed about this and I lie awake at night worrying about Eric's medical treatment or non-treatment. His parent's have had a very difficult time visiting with him. They were told that he is "Property of the State of Florida". His parent's were not even allowed to know where he was until after the last surgery. Every person needs and deserves to have their family who loves them, with them, during an emotional time such as this. He is only 21 years old. Imagine being all by yourself and facing what Eric is facing.

Would the sentence have been the same if his medical condition had been disclosed before sentencing? Being in prison for 20 years would be a horrible fate for anyone! Having a non-curable brain tumor would be a horrible fate for anyone also! But to be facing both at the same time seems to me, to be cruel and unusual punishment!

Please, I am begging you! For Eric's sake and the sake of his two little sons, who probably don't have much time left with their "daddy". Please send him home, please don't let him die in prison all alone! Only you have the power to ease this families suffering. Their suffering will not end, because Eric, regardless of where he sleeps is very, very ill. But, being able to oversee his medical treatment would be such a relief to us all! It is unbelievable and really scary at how terribly sick he got before he was given medical treatment by the State of Florida. Even though he and family members requested medical treatment well before it was finally given.

I'm sorry this letter is so lengthy, but I feel very strongly about this injustice. I have never written a letter like this before. I would not have bothered you for your time if I didn't really believe in my heart and soul that he should be free to live what time he has left with his family caring for him. Because, his family members, truly are the only ones who love him, and want him with them.

Thank you again for you time! I will be praying that you too will want to put Eric's health and well being above all else.



Sincerely,

Subject: RE: Governor & Chief Justice Unite To Promote GAL program


Governor:  I know your schedule is always booked way in advance, but one of the things I've learned that is unique about Voices for Children is that they leverage state dollars to raise private funds; so that  every $1 in state money actually generates $3 of GAL funding.  During our GAL working group, Nestor came up a very detailed plan to raise more private funds statewide for the GAL program; the plan is based on the program he has already developed here, and his program is unique in this state.  It seems like in this really tight budget year, it would be good to encourage the concept of matching funds or leveraging state dollars to raise private funds so as to do more good with less dependence on state dollars.   Voices for Children is a model for that plan.  Just wanted to let you know that in case there is another GAL event while you're here in Miami!!!

Dear Governor Bush: 

Thanks for your continued and loyal support! 

I've been in touch with Brandi regarding possible appearances by you and the Chief Justice on April 3rd at Aventura Mall. On that occasion, we officially launch our Child Abuse Awareness and Prevention Month celebration with a "Light of Hope" candle ceremony.  If this date is not convenient, we are having a reception and exhibit featuring the "Picturing Ourselves - Dependent Children Focus on Life through Words and Photographs" exhibition we recently had in the Rotunda of the Supreme Court of Florida.  The event is cosponsored by The Miami Herald, taking place on April 24 at 5:30 in the Main Lobby at The Herald. Please kindly have her office contact me if you are attending so that we may coordinate all details, press, etc. 

Hope all is well with you and family. 

Best, 

Nestor Rodriguez

Dear Governor Bush,
I'm sorry to bother you since I know you're busy with trying to solve lots of problems. 

Your brother, our beloved President, is definitely doing a great job in removing another dictator from power.
But an e-mail from a homeowner to me might tell you how homeowners feel about the problem:

"I have a hunch that the Iraqi people will be liberated from dictatorship much sooner than the millions of Americans who are doomed to live under domestic tyrannical regimes in associations."
 
So, please help homeowners from all over Florida by using your influence to get the Mandated Property Reform Task Force Bill - SB 1248 - moving in the Senate - in the original version! A few telephone calls to Senator Wise, the sponsor, and to Senators Webster, Argenziano, Bennett, Constantine and Posey would definitely go a long way. 
Please see the bill info at: http://www.ccfj.net/Taskforce03.html
 
All we want is a possibility to get together with all the stakeholders and find reasonable solutions to end the many problems homeowners are facing in Florida. 
 
Is that too much to ask? For many years everybody decided what's good for homeowners without asking them. I don't think I have to tell you where it got all of us?
 
Tax dollars are wasted in endless court battles, which could be put to much better use. There are much better solutions available, self-financed, ending many injustices and hardships.  Other States are already working on it!
 
Our friends from LULAC -- our condo committee chairman Humberto Sanchez is a LULAC council member --are desperately looking for a solution to the many problems. Especially many low-income families are suffering from harrassment and injustice!
Please see the LULAC resolution at: http://www.ccfj.net/taskforceLULAC.html 
Your help would be definitely very much appreciated down South. 
 
The horror stories from Miami and all over Florida are frightening. Please help all your constituents!
 
Giving Florida a better reputation in regards to the housing industry will definitely help to improve the possibilities to get more retirees to Florida, much needed as pointed out in the final report of the Destination Florida Commission. But since retirees live on fixed income they don't have the finances to fight in court for their given rights. Our government has the obligation to protect them from fraud and harrassment. They all deserve to spend their remaining years in peace!
 
Thank you for listening to our concerns! Your support will be definitely very much appreciated.
 
God Bless America!

Warm Regards

Jeb- Tramm is right, Republicans in several states like Utah, Iowa and

The House budget may be ready today. I will get it as soon as it is available, but there is not much we do not already know...except that $20m will appear for school recognition money. I am convinced that the house intends to eventually fully fund the program.

Subject:	Developmental Disabilities issues 
Attachments:	Legislative update! 3-03.doc

Hi Susan:

Several people forwarded your attached legislative updated on 2003 Developmental Disabilities issues.  As a parent myself of a young lady with significant cognitive, physical, behavioral, and health issues, I am always grateful for parents that like you advocate not just for their kids but for others. As a member of the Developmental Disabilities Redesign team, I hereby respectfully make a few comments to the information that you shared with others.

* Third party evaluators (Maximus) - It is my understanding that some recipients services have been adversely affected because the written "prior service authorizations" (PSA) are not necessarily reflecting all the needs of the individuals, or it's not clear as to how the PSA should be written.  We need to make sure that all Waiver Supports Coordinators (third party advocates) know how the PSA needs to be written, and understand the importance that an accurate and convincing PSA is presented on behalf of the recipient that they work for.  Having GOOD independent third party evaluators and advocates (WSC) can provide the system and our sons and daughters with checks and balances.  Let's ask the state to have this issue addressed as a Redesign issue.

* Wait List time -   People shouldn't wait years to receive services.  In addition to the needed additional funds to address this situation, another fair remedy is by making sure that ALL providers are accountable for what they are contracted to provide.  Adult day training programs (ADT), and residential habilitation (Res. hab) services (which account to 50% of the Waiver budget) should, for many recipients be of transitional nature, and not permanent as they mostly are.  If recipients are trained and habilitated, as contracted, to move from ADT and res. hab. to more independent services, it will clear some services and funding for some on the wait list.  It is my understanding that you are a board member of the Florida Association of Rehabilitation Facilities (FARF), and staff of ARC Broward.  If that is the case, you are in an ideal situation to influence the providers in that area.  I have repeatedly requested statistical information as to the percentage of recipients being trained (ADT) and habilitated (res. hab), but have never received answer.  Do you have that information?

* Tiered rate system - As you know, this is being addressed by the Redesign team.  We have made progress on that area.  It is my understanding that the level of disability will be reflected on the rates, not only for recipients that have challenging behaviors like your daughter and mine, but also for those that have lifting, incontinence and other challenging issues.  We need to continue to make sure that our input is reflected, and be vigilant so that those that live at home (who are the majority of the 25,000 on the waiver, and the 10,000 on the wait list) are not adversely affected by the rate structure, or by having lower rates to independent in-home and community providers.  

Again, let's work together (self advocates, parents, providers, legislators, state) for the benefit of all people with developmental disabilities regardless of the disability label (CP, spina bifida, MR, autism, pradi willi), or whether or not they are on the wait list or receiving services.  Juntos Podemos (Together We Can)!

Attached is a sheet with talk points


Another important issue is funding of Developmental Services for Med Waiver
Call speaker Byrd and Governor Bush and convey the following messages:

Adequately Fund Developmental Services for the Disabled
Please protect and help our most vulnerable citizens
" Fully annualize program funding for services to the developmentally disabled.

" Terminate the excessive contracts ($10 million plus) with third party evaluators who reduce and terminate services randomly, without regard to need and without seeing the children or families. 

" Provide services before families reach the crisis point.  Foster care children with disabilities are very difficult to place.

" Limit the amount of time the disabled must wait for services and ensure there is a plan to address the waiting list of 10,500 persons.

" Fund the existing deficit in DCF/Developmental Services; do not carry it forward for yet another year.

" Enact funding escalation provisions to keep pace with prevalence increases.  Funding for developmentally disabilities increased 94% in the past 4 years versus a 600% increase in the disabled population.

" Institute a tiered rate system for programs and services to difficult populations and individuals that are more aggressive, self-injurious and behaviorally involved, i.e. autism.

" Resolve and limit outlandish workers compensation premiums for providers of services to the most difficult developmentally disabled populations.


Please read the following and write your editorial boards in your newspapers and send copies to your legislators in your district.  This plea must come from all over the State and it must be heard loud and strong within the leadership of the House and the Governor's office.  The Senate is on board.  
Write and thank Senator Jim King for his help and leadership.

Currently, services for the developmentally disabled are significantly under-funded.  This situation in part is due to the fact that the incidence of autism, the most expensive population to treat, has increased by 520% in the last 5 years while funding for all disabilities has only increased 94%.  

There are over 10,500 people currently on the waiting list for assistance; many have been waiting more than 5 years.  In addition there is a $17 million deficit that has been carried over from last year that must be funded. The system is doomed for failure because it is continually playing catch-up.

Speaker Byrd and the Governor have taken the position that we must live within our means, just as a family would. Unfortunately, the current solution for addressing the waiting list of those in need of assistance is 'robbing Peter to pay Paul'.  Randomly reducing or terminating services to one disabled person in order to provide services to another is akin to check kiting. Eventually it will hit the fan. When it does, it ends up costing more and becomes a safety issue.  

You cannot justify taking crucial services from one disabled person to give to another. It is like telling one child that they ate yesterday so their brother gets to eat today.   Many who loose services request reconsideration and must undergo an arduous appeals process.  This means the state costs increase and the effort and legal expense the disabled family must endure creates additional stress and hardship.   It's like the old 'or your money back' deal.  I suppose they hope a large number will not appeal the cuts in services.  No matter how you look at it, bottom line: it is impossible to service more people with the same amount of money unless you take it from those already receiving it.

Unfortunately, the longer children wait for intervention, the worse their condition becomes.  The bigger and stronger the get, the more difficult they are to care for.  For every $1 we spend before the age of 5, we save $7 on lifelong care.  To neglect the needs of this population at a young age is penny-wise and pound-foolish.

Speaker Byrd and the Governor want to stay within the budget and have rejected recommendations to increase revenues through regulation of the video gaming industry. The Senate agrees that a family should live within their means.  However, if a family has a child that is in need of medical care they find a way to provide it.  They get another job, mortgage their home, sell off assets, increase credit, etc., they don't kite checks.

The Senate has a plan for a solution.  Florida already has gambling. We have lottery, cruises to nowhere, Indian reservation gaming hotels, horseracing and jaialai.  While hundreds of millions of dollars are being made, the state is receiving absolutely no revenue for many of these activities.  If Speaker Byrd and Governor Bush would agree to regulate this industry, many of the crucial needs of developmental disabilities and other deserving populations could be met.

Please call the Governor and Speaker Byrd and urge them to endorse the Senate recommendations for regulation of the gaming industry and resolve the debacle in DCF/Developmental Services.

By the way, contracting with african american businesses is up over 120 pct in two years after eliminating set asides and preferential pricing.

Thanks for writing.

Subject: BusinessWeek CFO-CIO Reaction

Governor Bush,
I had the pleasure of meeting you this week at the Business Week CFO-CIO
Conference in W. Palm Beach. I also had the opportunity to take photo with
you (I was the only Black-American conference participant). I was impressed
with the candor and contrast in two comments you made and would like to
offer a reaction to one of them. You mentioned with a great deal of passion
and conviction the importance of increasing the reading skills of students.
This is something that will benefit ALL students and I was impressed with
your candid remarks about how this focus has yielded particularly striking
results among the Black-American student population.

In contrast, yet equally candid and passionate, was your "executive license"
in eliminating race as a factor in admissions to colleges and universities,
and eliminating quotas or set-asides for contracts. Whatever stance you take
regarding the factor of race in decision-making, I wanted to caution you
against linking race with lowering standards. In principle, educators and
executives are looking for predictors of future performance. The SAT serves
a generalized purpose for this in regard to college success. Universities,
including my alma mater Harvard, simply understand that statistically the
high school grade point average is a more reliable predictor of college
success for Black American students than the SAT. Admittedly, there is more
to the story of what Florida has done regarding admissions, so I accept that
I may be missing critical elements of your thinking in this matter. Had I
been writing your speech, I would have added: "we understand the need to
provide equal access and opportunity for ALL students in the state of
Florida. Rather than simply make decisions on the basis of race, black or
white by the way, we want to have the most accurate and comprehensive
predictors of success for what is an increasingly diverse range of students.
In some cases that will be standardized scores, in some cases it will be
grade point averages, in some cases it may be reading and writing skills, or
ultimately a combination of these and/or other predictors. Though some
people associate race based decisions with erosion in standards, that has
not been my belief. We will have the same, high standards and expectations
for all students. We will also recognize that not everyone's promise and
potential can be measured in the same way."

I wish you continued success.

Florida Juvenile Justice Association

(Week of March 10-14)

All eyes this past week were on the Revenue Estimating Conference that met last Friday morning to readjust the anticipated revenue estimates for FY 03-04.  It was widely rumored that the news would be bleak and the available revenue would shrink by $300 million.  The actual estimate was worse than predicted. The Revenue Estimating Conference reduced the FY 03-04 revenue prediction by $358 million.

Senate Appropriations Chairman Ken Pruitt (R-Stuart) summed up the state of the state. He indicated that next year we will have a few hundred million to address a billion dollar problem. "The state will either have to find new sources of revenue or cut existing services dramatically".

Needless to say the lowering of the revenue estimate puts even more pressure on the House and Senate as they begin budget development.  Senate appropriations committees have already put together a budget proposal.  House staff worked this past weekend to develop the first cut of the House budget.  Staff indicates that the first cut of the budget in both chambers could be available as early as the end of this week.  With the House following the lead of the Governor, we should expect to see a huge cut to the Department of Juvenile Justice in the House budget.

The House Public Safety and Crime Prevention Committee heard and passed two juvenile justice bills.  PCB PS 03- 03 authorizes the judge to select both the commitment level and specific commitment program for a youth.  Presently by law the judge is authorized to pick just the commitment level and the Department picks the program.  The Department was the only group to speak against the bill.  The Committee was strong and vocal in their support that the judge should have a role in selecting the commitment program.  The bill passed 18-1.

The second bill, PCB PS 03-06, clarifies the timeline by which a youth shall be brought in front of the court for an adjudicatory hearing.  The one question raised was whether the Supreme Court could accomplish the same effect with a rule change rather than having to change the law.  The bill passed unanimously.

Scholarship Plan Aids Poor Kids


Florida lawmakers are scrambling to comply with the voters' directive that they reduce the number of students per classroom. State revenue officials estimate the constitutional amendment voters endorsed last year will ultimately cost $27 billion. The staggering mandate comes at a time when the state is already suffering budget shortfalls because of the sluggish economy. But as lawmakers look for solutions, they should utilize an existing program that reduces the strain on public schools and the burden on taxpayers. The Florida Corporate Income Tax Credit Scholarship Program has proved an effective way to help needy students. It also saves tax dollars. Expansion of the program, with a few provisions, is justified.
The Legislature launched the program in 2002. It provides tax credits under the state's corporate income tax system to businesses that contribute to a scholarship fund for needy students. The students receive $3,500 for tuition in a private school - that is almost $2,000 less than the average spent on public school students. The arrangement is a healthy one. Poor families are given the power to choose the school they believe best meets their children's needs. Public schools are spared the expense of accommodating those students. 
While some educators criticized the plan as an attack on public schools, the scholarship program, in fact, complements public schools, which have more resources than most private schools and remain the choice of most parents. Yet some children simply fare better at private schools, which offer a special curriculum, a more intimate atmosphere and more discipline. Why shouldn't poor families also have an opportunity to consider the advantages of private schools? Since the $3,500 generally doesn't cover the full cost of tuition, even parents receiving the scholarship have to pay some of the cost and thus have an added interest in seeing that the schools do their jobs.
Florida TaxWatch, the nonpartisan organization that monitors government spending, analyzed the program and estimated it will result in the state netting more than $25 million in unencumbered revenues during fiscal year 2003-04. Over eight years, the program would free up nearly $239 million. Moreover, reducing the need for student space in public schools means that school districts will save $227,914,130 that otherwise would be spent to accommodate 14,286 students. Those numbers are based on current funding. Lawmakers put a $50 million cap on the credit, which is available to businesses on a first-come, first-served basis. But TaxWatch says that if the funding level were increased to $100 million, the program would generate $32 million in unencumbered revenues in the next fiscal year and $478 million over eight years. It also would reduce the need for student space over eight years by nearly $456 million for 28,571 student stations. The savings to taxpayers over the eight years would be close to $1 billion. The equation is simple: School districts would need fewer teachers and classrooms as more students use the scholarships. As Florida TaxWatch President Dominic Calabro points out, the program entails almost no administrative costs. The money goes directly to the scholarships.
Beyond helping the state deal with its budget crisis, expanding the scholarship effort would help the poor and improve Florida schools. As TaxWatch puts it, ``School choice provides healthy competition between public and nonpublic schools and can result in improved education programs, teachers, facilities and opportunities for children.'' The tax credit is no threat to public schools. The majority of parents will choose public schools as long as they are meeting their children's needs. But the evidence shows that giving poor families the power to choose their children's school is good for families, good for society and good for the public treasury.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I am writing this letter to express my support for Robert Moeller in relation to the upcoming appointment of a new County Judge for Dixie County, Florida.
 
I have known Robert for nearly 30 years.  I first met him when he worked as a Pharmacist at Cheek’s Pharmacy in Cross City years ago.  I have found Robert to be a truthful, hard-working man.  He is very active in numerous community projects in this county and he is very supportive of our youth at the Suwannee River Fair and Livestock Show & Sale every year in March.
 
Aside of knowing Robert for so many years and becoming a friend to him, I have also had the opportunity to see him “in action” in his profession.  He has represented me in the past and I was very pleased with his representation of me.  He was always very straight-forward and very thorough in explaining the law to me as it pertained to my situation.
 
I sincerely feel that Robert is the best candidate of the three nominated for this position.  I have spoken with several people in the community and I know that the people here want Robert to be the next County Judge of Dixie County.  If this were an election, Robert would have the votes.  Please reflect upon Dixie County’s citizen’s wishes when you make your choice.
 
Thank you.
 
Sincerely,

Dear Governor Bush;

We are exceedingly proud of your hard work, dedication, and drive which paid off for yet another four year term. We are encouraged to know that you will continue to be blessed as our Great Governor of Florida and our prayers are forever with you and your entire family.

On another note, it has come to our attention that our son-in-law's brother, Willie Roy Digbie #109521 was recently transferred from Desoto Correctional Institution in Arcadia, FL. last month or so and sent to Madison Correctional Institution in Madison, FL.

It is our understanding that previously the late Jerome E. Gray, Esquire was to make you aware of this case since he was in process of working through some legal defenses on Willie's behalf to have him released. Abruptly all of Willie's hopes and dreams of being released in 1996-1997 had become overshadowed upon our significant loss.

He has been incarcerated for approximately (16) years this present year. He had requested for a parole several times before now, only to be denied each time. However, the latest request in the latter part of last year was returned to him with a note that his case was forwarded to the Governor's office for a final decision.

We would truly appreciate anything that could be done on his behalf in having him released. In the event we may be of further assistance to you, Governor Bush, please don't hesitate to contact us immediately at (954) 733-6247.

Respectfully Submitted,
Mr. and Mrs. John L. Gray

Governor,
 
I thought you might want to see this article as well. We often hear from opponents to school choice that the dollars in the program are not “accountable”.  Last month four of the five organizations administering the tax credit scholarship program surveyed all of the private schools participating in the program. Of the 426 schools surveyed, over 95% administer a nationally recognized, reference-normed test such as the Stanford 9 or the Iowa Basic Skills. The Manhattan Institute published the survey results.
 
The attached column was submitted by an administrator at the Better Way Christian Academy in Orlando, a school that serves primarily low income children and has 135 children attending the tax credit scholarship program.  Over 70% of them are Haitian-Americans. I think she eloquently describes what accountability really means.
 
The Sentinel sadly has not yet chosen to publish the submission.
 
Thanks,
 
John

i resigned and told Mr. Fair I could not participate as a board member until he brought the land acquisition to the board for approval (he signed on both sides of the transaction without any approval by the board for spending the SIT funds or for having the school participate in the joint venture).  however i agreed to act as pro bono counsel to the school (can't be both a director and attorney to the school anyway), and altho he agreed with me to make this right, it has taken nearly 18 months to get a board meeting together to address this transaction.  The board met Sat. a.m. for two hours, and refused to approve the transaction without an appraisal showing the property is worth what the school is investing; clean title to the property (there are many liens and encumbrances against this property); and some indication that the school can take on this financial commitment (school is running in the red).  While everyone may agree with Mr. Fair's vision, vision takes hard work, not just talk; also, the district will not approve the use of SIT funds without a viable plan to actually build a new school, which at the moment does not exist.  Mr. Fair's counsel (counsel for the Urban League) agrees he should not have been on both sides of the transaction, and has agreed to unravel the transaction and return the SIT funds to the school if the board so decides; also, you should know the auditors reported the lack of board participation as a material weakness of the school; this is the second time this has been reported, and if reported one more time, the school's charter is in danger.  Last Thursday Katrina and I met with the district school charter committee, and our charter is extended for 15 years (assuming we can keep the board functioning); and I raised with the district our use of the SIT funds, which will now go to the capital outlay committee (and which I'm sure will be approved if we do the work to get this done right)

If you are in the Central Florida area, help Christian Service Center in this worthwhile program. If you are outside of Central Florida, why not start a similar program to support deployed servicemens' families in your community. 
We'll keep sharing ideas and contact information as we receive them. Thank you to Robert Stuart, Christian Service Center and to Cindy Williams, Orlando Sentinel, our network participants, for letting us know about this program.

RE: DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES PROGRAM REDESIGN RATE STRUCTURE

Dear Senator Wilson:

I am writing to you in support of the excellent work that the Mercer group has done in helping us redesign the Developmental Disabilities Program and the great need that Florida has to create a new rate structure for all providers.  I have a son with developmental disabilities and I have had the opportunity to participate in a couple of the Developmental Disabilities Redesign Program meetings.  This has been a democratic process and I am opposed to the consideration of a "rate pilot" in a limited area instead of implementing the new rate structure for the entire State.  

Unfortunately, it seems that big agency providers are the only ones who are opposed to the new rate structure.  The new rate structure, as developed by Mercer in conjunction with the Developmental Disabilities Program Redesign Team, is fair and balanced and will provide consumers and their families with the best possible access to an array of services to foster independence.   

I urge you not to take away from this process and to support the new rate structure for the entire State of Florida.

Sincerely,

Hi Jeb,
I had called a left a urgent message for Denver to call me last week as I
may need your help in the coming days to get Chlorine to our state. As we
have discussed our company provides approximately 70% of the chlorine for
potable and waste water  treatment to our state. Should we not get product
and not able to repackage and ship product to all major municipalities,
cities would be forced to issue boil water orders, that create havoc for
many users. Backround is that the railroads have a plan to embargo all
shipments of hazardous materials once the country goes to code red. Only
after that can individual companies apply for a permit to ship product from
the railroads and only with Fed approval. I am on the board of the Chlorine
Institute and we have lobbied to do this before the crisis happens,but have
been told the system is in place and can't be changed. The problem is there
is approx 10 days shipping time to get elemental chlorine to Florida from
production points in the gulf (Louisiana,Texas) and 17 days from Canada.
Because of security concerns and shortages in supplies we have not been
allowed to stock up to cover this embargo period, should it happen,(these
can last up to 72 hours per period). What I do understand is that if Florida
declares a state of emergency the railroads will immediately ship or at
least work through the Feds to allow shipments. We need to set up a plan
should this occur. I know Denver is busy, but this is important stuff and we
are trying avert a potential crisis that may be hours away, should the rails
stop or DOT(Feds) stop  our trucks that deliver the product to each
municipality. We were offered national guard after Hurricane Andrew to drive
our trucks but we were able to bring in staff from other locations to cover
the shortfall. We are in touch with community affairs personnel and their
hands are also tied. I would appreciate your help in getting a plan in place
now as time is now of the essence.
Warmest Regards,

Bob Namoff

Commissioner:

We sent out a response to the Orlando Sentinel editorial last week.

Letter is below.

Bill Edmonds

Letter to Editor
Orlando Sentinel, March 21, 2003
An editorial in Wednesday's edition ("FCAT Failures") contended that
elements of the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test were too hard for
young readers. This suggests that the editors of the Orlando Sentinel fail
to understand what a good test is designed to do - to gauge a student's
abilities.

This means that a well-crafted test has questions and passages that vary,
with some harder than others. This also means that it is not expected that
every student will answer every question correctly.

For example, few students score a 1,600 on the SAT - yet the college
entrance exam is not deemed a failure because some portions are too
challenging for most students. A good test provides a range that can assess
a student's skills, whether that individual is an average student or a
superior one.

The same is true with the FCAT exam. For the FCAT to do its job - to
adequately gauge a student's abilities - then the reading test must offer a
range of material. That's why some passages are easy, and some passages are
hard.
The Orlando Sentinel's editors are putting too great a faith in readability
formulas, which are notoriously unreliable. In writing the FCAT exam, we
rely instead on reading experts and teachers, whose judgment and experience
cannot be replaced by online readability meters.
The FCAT exam is carefully designed, with extensive review, to ensure that
all questions and reading passages are appropriate, are fair, are without
bias and are based on the Sunshine State Standards. The reading passages are
suitable to the age group, and it is true that some portions are
challenging. That's as it should be.

Governor, 

Thank you very much for taking time out of your busy schedule to help us promote Florida at Business Week's CIO-CFO conference at the Breakers.  This was an important and influential national audience of major technology companies.  It is an audience that we are trying to reach in our marketing efforts and your presence really helped to showcase Florida. 

In fact, several executives commented to me that they were really impressed with your keynote address.  They were surprised that you sounded more like a businessman than a politician and were particularly taken with your energy and enthusiasm.  And, many also noted that they didn't know that Florida had so much going for it -- that we had a strong technology base and were so pro-business.  

I was able to follow up on the great start you gave us by welcoming the delegates at the dinner which we sponsored with a very quick commercial on Florida as the Innovation Hub of the Americas.  With your help, I think we made some good inroads in our image and business development opportunities. We will continue to engage these executives with post-conference marketing to continue to be proactive and aggressive in our marketing of Florida's strengths. 

Thank you again for accepting this engagement on our behalf.  I personally appreciate it and there is no doubt that your presence was critical in our ability to promote Florida as a technology and business state.   

Darrell.

If you should visit with the President on Wednesday in Tampa, please

Subject: Mediating with the Manatee Club



Dear Governor Bush: 


As you know, the Manatee Club broke its agreement to delay new Federal speed zones in Florida and even stated there was no agreement to break. 


More than a dozen organizations, including ours (Florida Marine Contractors [FMCA]) and including the Club's Judith Vallee and Patti Thompson, carefully crafted a set of three agreements that would have allowed all of us to proceed into mediation in good faith. 


Vallee now claims her board or co-litigants wouldn't ratify the agreement. Aside from the sad fact that they have used this ruse time and again, if they truly had tried to sell the deal and failed, they should have immediately asked to reconvene mediation to draft an agreement their parties would accept. No. They simply waited until within Judge Sullivan's court to move forward with their plan. 


By breaking the agreement to delay the zones, which you have publicly opposed, the Club unraveled almost all the progress made in mediation to date. The only remaining portion of the agreement that may yet be fulfilled is the FWS's promise to undo its famously ill-considered "memorandum" requiring formal biological opinions even on family docks. The rest of the agreement is just another "scrap of paper." 


What next? Does this mean, as our Association members believe, that it is impossible to negotiate in good faith with that Club? 


Because we strongly support Ken Haddad's efforts, our Association will attend a follow-on manatee meeting if he so requests. As you may know, the Association first proposed mediation to Colleen in early January. We are strong advocates of the process. 


If a follow-on meeting takes place, FMCA will state three new conditions for ongoing meetings: 


1) An immediate downlisting of the manatee to "threatened," thereby bringing the species into compliance with current State rules and regulations. Immediate action is vital in order to make a more powerful case against those new Federal zones, which we all recognize are unnecessary. When new models and data become available, hopefully very soon, the Commission can revisit the manatee's status -- which is "of concern" at worst, and most likely can be taken wholly off the list. 

2) Suspension of all so-called Federal areas of "inadequate protection," which would be submitted for review to local panels now mandated by State law. Following the downlisting and upon completion of the reviews, the results would form a rare consensus on management needs not driven solely by the Club or the Club's court. As an example, the 94 square mile no motor zone in the North Banana River Lagoon is considered an area of inadequate protection. How, exactly, can one better protect a motor-free zone? Local panels would rapidly debunk such nonsense. 

3) Recognition that FMCA's lawsuit challenging the jurisdiction of MMPA will move forward regardless of mediation. MMPA rule-making will be an economic disaster for Florida and must be opposed by every legal means possible. The sooner we move this issue before a judge, the better. 


In sum, there won't be much "conciliation" at the next meeting. But having seen the proof that good faith alone is not sufficient when negotiating with the Club, we will do our utmost to help concerned officials like Ken Haddad craft a truly viable new approach. 


Sincerely, 


Steven Webster

Mr. Harper,

I am carbon-copying the Governor again as I have been unable to get answers 
to questions asked a while back, still, and reiterated again last Thursday.  
They appear in  numbered form at the end of that most recent e-mail.  I am 
hoping/assuming an office/position such as yours has clearly identifiable 
criteria used to determine malfeasance, misfeasance, gross negligence and so 
on. Without working definitions, your office would lack both reliability and 
validity in assessing complaints filed through your office.  please share 
answers to those questions.

In addition, i want to clarify -- it is my understanding that because you do 
not  think Ferpa was violated (a moot point, actually, according t o our 
state supreme court rulings and the legislative intent) you chose not to 
investigate last year AND even though i was retaliated fro filing with your 
office and not reappointed now this year that you will not investigate that 
claim AT ALL -- simply because of your arbitrary (and wrongful) determination 
last year that ferpa was not violated?  

It is my understanding, in such a case, that a formal finding would 
nonetheless be issued now, usually in memo form I assume.  Please send that 
via email AND snail mail.  My current address is :
Dr, Ken Williams
562 Peck Ave
Ft. Myers, FL 33919

Such a memo would advise me of timelines and filing deadlines if taken to 
court I believe.

To the Governor, do you agree that running the risk of violating student 
privacy (social security numbers even have been sent via email) and charging 
students lab fees when such money is not going toward lab fees at all (and 
money is not being returned to the students who were overcharged) are not 
events a professor at a college in your state should be concerned about?  Do 
you think there should be no agency to which we could go to bring these 
concerns.  Edison College does have an agent on campus to whom this could be 
reported (which I did) BUT that agent notified ALL campus administrators that 
I had been the whistleblower on the college and my dean, and I have suffered 
retaliation since then -- it escalated after reporting this to Harper's 
office.  I guess you support this?  I have included the five questions I have 
asked of Mr. Harper.  I assume there is some non-arbitrary criteria which 
must exist in that office but have been unsuccessful in getting details from 
Mr. Harper -- it is almost as if the criteria is a secret OR that standards 
do not exist that can be articulated in any reasonable way.  I hope that is 
not the case, and ask for your involvement.  After all, I grow increasingly 
concerned that they may have no identifiable criteria that they use to make 
determinations/ decisions    (Keep in mind they do NOT seem to use state 
supreme court decisions t o  make  their determinations -- on the contrary, 
the decisions from FCHR have been counter to the court's decisions.).  if 
this is the case, I would think you and your office would want to be made 
aware --  sadly when other state agencies were discovered to have 
problems/issues, it was played out in the press as a reflection of you and 
your office.  As a fellow republican, I hate to see things like that happen 
-- I am confident you would want standards to exist at FCHR and hope that you 
see no harm in citizens having such information, particularly in an open 
records state.

As such, I have to ask for your help again, Sir.  I do apologize for the 
inconvenience this may cause.

respectfully,


dr. Ken E. Williams

Hi,
Just had to drop you a note and share with you some info about our Partners in Transition Conference workgroup.... We had the most amazing two days together in Tall. last week.... There we agency heads, reps. from Parent organizations, parents, DD council folks, etc., at this meeting... We all worked very hard to put together the beginning of a 4 year strategic plan to address the needs of our DD population regarding transition from high school in to the "real" world...

You would have been very proud of the true "team work" that was displayed...  Thanks for begin such a great leader and setting the tone for collaboration...

Turns out no state is doing a good job of transition and again Florida is on the "leading edge"....Hope you can make our conference in June... It's going to be amazing...  We will finalize our plan, with impute from folks around the state, then hit the ground running.

Dear Governor:

I just received a note from a woman in Panama City sharing with me that her former instructor recently had a chance to speak with you directly on the plight of surgical technologist and their efforts to regulate this profession. She stated you were aware of the situation and seemed to be in favor of regulation, be it registration or licensure.

The plan to date is to send a letter to Senator Saunders (this is what he instructed me to do) and he would pass it one to Senator King, who would then decide if it should be looked at and studied to be presented during next years session. This is farther than I got with the House, Representative Farkas just keeps sending me back to the FHA. I wish I could get the House committed to at least study it also. 

Hospitals set the rules for this profession and they are not standardized through out the state. Education and skill requirements for this dangerous occupation should be standard. Some of our hospitals do require certification (that is done through our National organization, after graduating from an accredited school and passing a National exam) but many do not require any formal training or education of any sort. This is so very dangerous to the public!

Several legislators have agreed with our desire to regulate and our amused that we want government intervention. They do understand that leaving the decisions to hospitals on who should be practicing this profession is dangerous. Several have suggested that we hire a lobbyist -- keep in mind, we are the lowest paid professional in the operating room, lobbyist aren't low paid! 

I will be at the Capitol on Thursday with the physicians during their rally concerning liability insurance. My plan is to bring you information about the surgical technologist (a very small portfolio, with a scant amount of information) so you can see what we propose. 

In this day and age of cutting back on frivolous boards I can easily state, a board for implementing standards of care with education and skill standards to protect the public from this potentially dangerous practice is not frivolous. It's a matter of life or death.

Thanks for listening to us. 

Sincerely,
Katherine Ashton,
President, Florida State Assembly of the 
Association of Surgical Technologists, Inc.

Dear Governor Bush,
Sir, I'm sorry to bother you at such a busy time. I have a problem that I
feel is important since it involves my daughter, Sarah Godber. I was
notified last week that I lost my daughter's only respite caregiver,
Jacquelyn Bruce. I ask that my daughter be placed under your "Controlled
Consumer Care Program" as soon as possible, so that I may choose someone
I know and trust to provide respite care for her. I don't want just
another respite caregiver. Just because someone holds a piece of paper
that says "Respite Care Provider" doesn't make them a good caring
provider. I love my daughter and care about her welfare, and I want
someone that I know personally, that was the reason I chose Mrs. Bruce to
begin with. I'm sure you wouldn't want just anyone watching your daughter
if she had a disability. Thank you for your help.
Sincerely,
Linda Godber

It is my understanding the release of the Just for the Kids best

went well. Your Lt Gov attended in your place and I was told it got good
coverage. Another project we are working on is the Eli Broad prize for
the
best urban school district in the country. The Foundation hired us last
year
at the suggestion of the White House to run the selection process. The
initial winner selected by a jury of prominent leaders across the
country
was the Houston Independent School District. In addition there were 4
other
finalists. The 5 districts received a total of $1,000,000 in
scholarships
for their students. The selection process is stringent and based upon
academic results and site visits. I have been asked to ask you to serve
as a
juror this year. The other jurors will include Gov Hunt, Jack Welch,
Dick
Riley, Henry Cisneros, Richard Parsons (CEO of Time Warner), Phil Condit
(CEO of Boeing), Gov Patton and several others. The jurors meet one time
to
review our work and pick the winner. Last but not least I would still be
happy to come meet with some Florida foundations regarding the Advanced
Placement program if that is something you would like me to do.

Subject:	President's Homeland Security Supplemental

The WH had a conference call this evening regarding the newly released Appropriations Supplemental request by the President of Congress.  They release information on the portion for Domestic Preparedness.  The entire Supplemental request will also include funding for the war effort and reconstruction of Iraq.  Outlined below is a domestic package of $2 billion dollars for state counter terrorism programs, flowing through Office of Domestic Preparedness, as follows:

1.5 billion	grants for tradition ODP funding, i.e., equipment training, exercises, planning.  The distribution is calculated on typical ODP base plus per capita formula. 80% must flow to locals.

 450million	to augment states’ funding of critical infrastructure.  Distribution by same ODP base plus per capita formula.  Only 1/3 must flow to locals.

  50 million	High Threat Urban Areas.  Distribution as determined by Secretary.

The Administration is working w/ Congressional Leadership to complete action prior to Congress recessing for Easter (approximately by April 11).  However even if they are able to keep this time frame, the states would have 45 days to submit applications; and the Dept of Homeland Security would have another 30 days to approve.  It could be late summer, early fall before states see the dollars flowing.  And, given the debate over dollars for the war effort and reconstruction…it would be later.

Many state offices participated in the call…only 3-4 Governors.  Nina

I tend to think that the Director of the Office of Insurance Regulation will have a real challenge managing four bosses in that position with such great policy and political implications.

I'm sure that Kevin's long relationship with Gallagher gives him a greater personal comfort there. However, I am not troubled by whether Kevin would be sufficiently loyal to you. I believe that he will be.

I've been out of the loop and don't know if anything specific has happened.  But if general concerns about loyalty have the potential to shape your decision, I would encourage you to not let them.

Hello J.C. and Alex,

I wanted to give you a copy of the report I'm posting to our group this
afternoon. We so appreciated both of you coming out to speak to us!

I hope you can take my assessment of your presentation, Dr. Williams, in
the spirit in which it is intended, which with the hope of greater, more
inclusive communications with all state home educators, regardless of
their faiths, methodologies or ideologies.  You said very well, at one
point, what was all you really had to say: That from lower earth orbit,
we're all in the same business of educating our children, and that the
DOE will support us in that effort.  

My comments about your religious remarks are necessary because many LIFE
Fest guests came to me in alarm afterwards; most of our members, like
many, many home educators throughout the state, are not of the Christian
faith.  Some of our members are Buddhist, others agnostic, some atheist,
some, like myself, are Unitarian Universalist, a faith which draws from
a wealth of religious tradition, and some are of other faiths.  A lot of
us didn't cut our spiritual teeth on the Bible, but on other literature.
As a government employee, we felt it was rather outside the realm of
your public office to draw upon religious testimony as a central tenet
of education.

None of this is to say, however, that we don't value your experience,
your expertise, and your advocacy.  We just hope that you will extend
your valuable skills and talents in the service of all educators and all
viable educational options,regardless of faith or lack of it.

Thank you again, both of you, for all you have done and are doing for
home education in Florida.  You have our gratitude and our support, and
we trust that we have yours as well.

Sincerely,

Terri Willingham

LIFE Fest 2003 Report
March 22, 2003
by Theresa Willingham
pubmail @tampabay.rr.com
www.LIFEofFlorida.org

First, many, many thanks to the downtown branch of the Orlando Public
Library! They were absolutely incredible!  They had asked me to send
them my "ideal vision" of the meeting room, showing where we'd like
tables, chairs and the podium. My husband drew up a design based on what
they told us they had available and he faxed it to the library on
Friday. On Saturday morning, there was my "ideal vision," perfectly laid
out and ready to go.  It was wonderful!  They also provided a special
story time program for our group, and invited interested guests to sit
in on a Native American presentation in the children's area, as well.

After a mad scramble to get everything out on the tables by 10AM, an
effort aided by helpful early arrivals -- and boy was there a LOT of
stuff!--  we managed to get started at about 10:15.  Not too bad,
considering I spent my first fifteen minutes downtown driving around and
around downtown, and once around Lake Eola.  

We started with a moment of silence, reflecting on world events (which
were being repeated hourly on a television monitor in the lobby).   Then
I opened LIFE Fest with a few words about the purpose of LIFE of
Florida.   

For the record (and since I couldn't figure out how to turn on the mike
and maybe not everyone heard), here's what I said:

"We're here to tell you what home educators have said officially for
three decades and what's been proven unofficially for centuries - that
parents and family are a child's best teachers, and living meaningfully
and intentionally in our world is the best classroom.

"Learning IS for everyone and everyone is entitled to learn in ways that
suit each person best. That's what choice in education is all about -
and what home education does best for so many of us."

J.C. Bowman, director of the DOEs Office of Choice, was our first
speaker and is just as warm and engaging in person as he is in written
communications and on the telephone.   He assured everyone that he
"wants to be aware of problems," that the Dept. of Education wants "to
leave  you alone but to assist where assistance is requested."

"We work for you," said Mr. Bowman.  "We understand that and we'll be as
involved as you want us to be." 

Mr. Bowman believes he has earned our trust by being up front with us,
interested and listening.  He said that, ultimately, we all have "the
same theme, the same purpose, the same vision" of giving our children
the best education, and that we can best accomplish that through
collaboration.

His vision for educational choice in Florida includes the expansion of
the Florida Virtual School and the development of new options like
K12.org.  He urged us to continue to stay aware of the issues, and
assured us that we can always contact him with questions and concerns.  

Dr. Alex Penn Williams spoke next.  

Dr. Williams calls Melbourne, FL (Brevard County) home, but spends her
work week in Tallahassee.  Her daughter attends a private Christian
school in Brevard. But she acknowledges the value of a family-based
education.

"My best teacher," she said, "Was, is and probably always will be my
mother."

Dr. Williams described a privileged educational background spent in
"faith based" private schools and then at a private performing arts
school.  She worked for the Ministry of Education in the Bahamas, as a
resource teacher.  Later, she taught high school English in Brevard
County, where she said teachers were called "units."  

That experience, she said, "was an eye opener. At that point I felt
there were some things that needed changing."

Dr. Williams said it was interesting that she spent the first two weeks
in her new job "trying to explain to the Governor why I was being
perceived as a public school person" when public school officials had
always thought the opposite. She said she feels she was pegged as a
public school advocate "because of all my reform efforts."  Those
efforts included helping put together pre-K-12 groups, and running a
curriculum consulting company for home educators and private schools for
three or four years. 

Dr. Williams opened her talk on a positive note, telling us, "The
environment in the DOE for homeschooling is as good as it's been ever,
and it's going to get even better."

She spoke at great length and with great conviction, with repeated
assurances that, as Executive Director of the office of Independent
Education, she  will always advocate for us and "watch our backs."

She said she believes the one on one teaching environment that home
education provides is the "Golden Pair," the ultimate teacher/student
relationship that, "ideally we can't have.everywhere." That's where
schools come in, she said.  Homeschooling efforts are "just going back
to what really worked."

Then Dr. Williams took a somewhat puzzling evangelical detour, quizzing
LIFE Fest guests on how "we all learned to read," presumably trying to
reinforce more personally the value of family learning.

"From the "one book," Dr. Williams told us emphatically.  "The one real
book."

"What book was that?" She asked us forcefully a couple of times. 

She was met with puzzled silence. Some LIFE Fest guests later told me
they initially thought, "Dick and Jane?"  As I realized where Dr.
Williams was headed, I was sorely tempted to call out, "The Koran?" "The
Bagavad Gita?"  "The Torah?"  Fortunately, we all restrained ourselves,
because she answered her own question, on the heels of the great
silence, and said, "The Bible!" 

I was later asked if I had explained to her what kind of support group
LIFE of Florida is.  Yes, I had.  I had explained to Dr. Williams when
we first communicated that LIFE of Florida was comprised of a diverse
group of home and alternative learners, and that we differed
ideologically from the FPEA and HEF, and conservative home and
alternative learners in general.  One of our members had actually
written expressing concern about Dr. Williams' repeated use of the term
"faith based" in her introductory letter to the Florida homeschool
community. Dr. Williams even recognized the letter writer at LIFE Fest.
And  I know Dr. Williams has looked at our website.  

But it never occurred to me that someone would so freely assume, at a
public gathering, in a public library, no less, that her personal
religious convictions were so widely shared that she could use those
convictions to appeal to her listeners.  Of greater concern to me was
that she did this in an official, government capacity, as a
representative of the Department of Education. (*Please note that the
concern here is not about Dr. Williams' Christianity, but about her
assumption not only that we are all of the same faith, but that
reassurances about her faith should somehow be interpreted as
reassurances about her efforts on our behalf as a government official.
While some home educators might take comfort in the public profession of
personal beliefs, I hope no one is lulled into a false sense of security
regarding what's going on in Tallahassee just because of those beliefs.)

Dr. Williams went on to say that we have freedom of speech, freedom of
religion (we'll assume she means freedom of ALL religions), and even the
freedom to bear arms.  

"But do we really have freedom of education?" she asked. "Unless you
[can afford] to do private education or make the incredible sacrifice to
homeschool," Dr. Williams suggested our choices in education can be
somewhat limited, and the New DOE wants to change that.

"The Department of Education doesn't think it's right that you *must*
attend a particular school because of where you live." 

And that's the mission of the Independent Education Office, to provide a
wider range of choices for all state residents, as free of regulation as
possible, with the single goal: "to serve our children."  The Office of
Independent Education includes oversight (however limited) of not only
home education, but post secondary schools, independent public schools
(charters), and independent private schools that get assistance in the
way of McKay Scholarships and other public monies. 

"Reorganization gave independent K-20s a stronger voice," she said

Rest assured, said Dr. Williams: the Office of Independent Education
wants to ensure our "freedom from government intervention."  But that
requires diligence, she said.

"I am going to be watching your backs," said Dr. Williams. "Bureaucracy
loves to creep up on its citizens! I'm going to be an advocate."

Dr. Williams touched on Florida Virtual School, as had J.C. Bowman. 

"Florida Virtual School is an incredible opportunity for all citizens to
avail themselves of a great education," she said.  

The current reorganization of FLVS funding is designed so that "each
child will earn the school money by attending.so it doesn't have to be a
line item of the budget" every year. 

At one point, Dr. Williams praised the efforts of Brenda Dickinson for
the work she does "for us." When it was pointed out to Dr. Williams that
Ms. Dickinson does not represent the entire homeschool community, Dr.
Williams chastised, "I won't get into the business of politics or
infighting. From lower earth orbit, we're all in the same business of
educating our children."

Dr. Williams was later apprised of the fact that our concerns about the
Home Education Foundation had nothing to do with "infighting" but about
the fact that HEF must not be relied upon to accurately and effectively
inform state home educators about issues that concern all of us, that we
want equal access to information, and equal ability to comment and to be
heard.  She seemed to have a better understanding of our concerns after
this.

When asked to lead the Office of Independent Education, Dr. Williams
said  she told the DOE "I have to have total freedom to do what I feel
is right with homeschooling. And that was key, because if I can't have
that, you can't have that."

The work at hand, now, said Dr. Williams is "how do we transition to
pulling those services (that home educators need or value) out from
bureaucracy to give you better support, advocacy, services and purely
informational support?

"I'm going to be looking into corners, pulling up carpets and looking
under furniture" to streamline support and services, said Dr. Williams.
"By the time the session is over, probably in June, we'll have some
recommendations for how we can do things better.

"Don't listen to the rumor mill," said Dr. Williams, about issues that
come up. "But come straight to the horse's mouth," that being either
Mary Lou Carothers, who continues to direct the Home Education Program,
or Dr. Williams who oversees that office.

Among the communications improvements the Office of Independent
Education is considering is an email network of home educators to help
keep everyone informed, and updated on relevant Legislative issues.  

"You are becoming a critical mass and making a contribution to the
excellence of education in this state," said Dr. Williams.

"We won't be an association for you. We'd like to be an arm to get
information out to you and make you part of the education community."

Many of Dr. Williams comments had a very positive ring to them, and it
was clear that she is sincere in wishing to advocate for home education.
Her comments about accountability, particularly as this relates to
"articulation" however, raised some concerns among listeners.

"Accountability is important," said Dr. Williams.  "It's probably
important to you, too."

She went on to say that "Parents are the best adjudicators of
accountability.  You already have the highest degree of accountability.
You don't have to defend yourselves there."

This discussion segued into Dr. Williams' views on "articulation,"or the
transferring of credits to public and secondary schools.  Currently,
said Dr. Williams, districts don't accept homeschool credits.

"We're trying to make articulation agreements to where schools have to
accept [homeschool work]. There needs to be agreement.  I want to
rewrite the school code [to allow acceptance of homeschool records] ,"
so that homeschool portfolios and other evidence of home education work
will be accepted by school guidance personnel.  "When someone looks at
what you've done, they can look at your child's work at face value."

Dr. Williams feels we have to have to "stay unified and speak in one
voice" as home educators because we "live in a political world." 

"You don't need to be on the defensive as a unified voice and in a
non-unified way, you may want to find a way to show what you've been
doing. 

"Portfolio assessments are very well regarded in all areas of the
education community."

More to the point, though, when asked about the potential for statewide
testing of homeschoolers, Dr. Williams replied, "While I'm there, that's
not going to happen."

After Dr. Williams, we were treated to an enthusiastic presentation
about Orange County Parks and Recreation resources and programs by Mr.
Justin Campfield. 

Doug Scull, of Hands on Planet Earth was the next speaker and provided a
much needed break for the children (and adults) with an engaging look at
a variety of small (and some not so small) creatures.  

Steve and Colleen Lumbert, of Kids Voting Central Florida, then led the
children in a rousing patriotic parade around the room and told them all
about the value of being informed citizens and how their voices can be
heard: voting!   

After lunch, Rosemary DuRocher , a guidance counselor with the Florida
Virtual School and a long time supporter of home education, addressed
the group.  She began with a brief but meaningful discussion about
homeschooling highschoolers and the dual role we take on as
homeschooling parents at this time.   It's important at this time, said
Ms. DuRocher, to use life lessons to help children become more
accountable at all levels as they head towards adulthood.

Florida Virtual School can help with this process, and continues to be
enormously popular in the homeschool community, she said.  Summer
enrollment brought in 12,000 applications, which translates to about
7000 students.  FLVS plans to expand its offerings, with an 8th grade
curriculum going out in "Beta," or test, form next year, followed by 7th
grade courses the following year, and then 6th grade course offerings.
There are also nearly a dozen Advanced Placement course offerings
currently, through which students can earn college credits. Enrollment
is expected to hit 19,000 in the coming year.

The only thing Ms. DuRocher cautioned against is over-enrolling in too
many classes, which enthusiastic home educators sometimes tend to do.  

"We don't want to be bureaucratic," said Ms. DuRocher. "We don't want to
say "Your child can't do this."   Everyone is entitled to try and won't
be discouraged by FLVS in any way, she said.

But those enrolling in FLVS classes should be aware that it takes five
to seven hours of work per week per class, with completed assignments
required on a weekly basis.  Five classes would mean a minimum of
thirty-five hours a week at the computer, she said, which is a lot of
computer time for anyone, let alone a teenager. 

Priority enrollment in FLVS is constituted by Florida legislature, she
explained, with priority given to public school students, those in
academically challenged institutions and, as of this year,
pre-registered homeschoolers.   Students in these categories can
register for each term's classes a full week before registration opens
to the public. 

As for the tuition legislation scare that made the rounds the day before
LIFE Fest, and which threatened to impose tuition on home and private
schooled students, she said she doesn't believe anything will come of
it.  Tallahassee had been flooded with calls from concerned citizens as
soon as word of the potential legislation got out, and the issue never
made it to the floor. 

Ms. DuRocher concluded with a nod of appreciation to the homeschool
community.  "We owe so much to the homeschool population of this state
for keeping us funded and viable." 

Our final speaker left us with a promising look ahead for LIFE of
Florida.  Susan Hubscher, of the Kennedy Space Center, made a spirited
and enthusiastic presentation about all of the resources and programs at
the KSC Visitor Complex.   This year marks KSCs expansion into and
recognition of the homeschool community in Florida. At the same time Ms.
Hubscher was joining us, KSCs first "Salute to Homeschoolers" was being
held at the Visitor Complex, with a full day program including lunch,
tours and hands on programs.  Over 300 homeschool families had reserved
tickets, she said, and she was delighted with the turn out and the
enthusiasm of homeschoolers in general.

Ms. Hubscher said KSC was expanding its programs in an effort to put
"education and fun together."  Future plans call for an overnight
adventure at the Saturn Five Center, with a scavenger hunt and a sunrise
tour of facilities.  Space Camp KSC is a revamped version of the old
Huntsville program that is operating as a day camp.  The Education
Resource Center at KSC continues to offer a myriad of educator
resources, as well.  Many of those resources can be found at
www.kennedyspacecenter.com.

Declared Ms. Hubscher, "We have the best resources on the planet - in
the Universe!"

It was hard to doubt her!  But the real treat came after she spoke to
the group and a number of us went to chat with her informally.   She
spoke about plans for next year's Salute to Homeschoolers, and I
wondered aloud about the possibility of holding LIFE Fest 2004 at the
Education Resource Center, in conjunction with the "Salute" program.
Ms. Hubscher liked the idea and wanted to talk about it during the year.
LIFE Fest would remain free to everyone, but those interested could also
participate in the Homeschoolers program.  It's certainly a wonderful
idea to explore, and would give LIFE of Florida a new measure of
recognition and a unique relationship with a very special resource in
our state. 

Overall, I think LIFE of Florida was informative and fun.  We got some
great networking in, too. A representative from the Center for Inquiry,
"an international non-profit organization that explores and advances
critical thinking, intellectual freedom, and the scientific outlook
through research, publishing, education, and social services."
(http://www.centerforinquiry.net/fl.htm) joined us and was delighted to
learn about secular homeschooling and hopes to work more closely with us
in the future. 

I'm looking forward to next year's program, and excited about the
potential for growth and increased viability in coming years. In just
one year, we've grown from less than 40 members to nearly 200. We have
the respect and, more importantly, the attention of, the Department of
Education and are fast on our way to becoming a powerful voice - or at
least bullhorn for! - home educators in Florida. Thanks to all of you
for making LIFE of Florida so very special! Looking forward to LIFE Fest
2004!

Subject:	Florida Freedom Initiative: The System of the Future

Governor,
Today the Aponte family and  I had the exciting opportunity to participate
in the President's Committee on Mental Retardation (PCMR) Roundtable on
wealth creation, financial knowledge, and economic security for persons
with disabilities. The roundtable included Madeleine Will, Chairman of the
President's Committee on Mental Retardation, Dr. Margaret Giannini,
Director of the Office on Disability and many other lead officials and
experts  in Health and Human Services. The purpose and desired outcome of
the roundtable is to create the system of the future that allows people
with intellectual disabilities to take advantage of incentives to work,
increase income and assets, resolve housing and transportation conflicts,
and maintain a baseline of reasonable benefits. The current system is very
complex and major reforms will take time, but we have a unique opportunity
in Florida to make (or at least test) some significant and revolutionary
changes now through our proposed 1115 waiver concept for the Fl Freedom
Initiative. Florida submitted a broad Medicaid waiver request through the
new Independence Plus waiver template on December 12th and I believe we can
expand on this pending proposal by seeking additional freedom/authority
from SSA to waive certain income and earning limitations in State and
Federal law. This would allow Florida to conduct a comprehensive statewide
demonstration of an innovative and highly discretionary health and human
service system for individuals with disabilities at no additional cost.
With the President's new freedom initiative and your commitment to
individuals with disabilities, we have a rare opportunity to make
meaningful and lasting changes. Congressional and political debates about
reform could be lengthy and many  persons with disabilities transitioning
from school or seeking employment need our help now. If you are in support
of this idea, I believe we can make this happen for Florida and serve as a
model for other states. Shelly

Jeb, 
I'd like to take this opportunity to recommend Kevin McCarty for the Director of Insurance. I have known Kevin for many years and while he served in various capacities.

Through my law firm I have been in and around the insurance and financial services industries nationally now for over a decade. As a result, I am privileged to attend and serve on various committees at the conferences of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. On numerous occasions, and on a regular basis, I have personally observed the widespread recognition Kevin receives for his professionalism in regulation, as well as for his ability to work through matters that assist in the build-up of capital markets and attract new business. He is clearly a known commodity on the national insurance scene. 

Also, he has been resilient in serving several administrations. That speaks for itself, especially with this particular appointment. Without hesitation, I would say Kevin will be an asset to the administration, and I am convinced you will find his loyalty and commitment beyond reproach. He is deserving of your support. 

If you need additional information or would like to discuss this matter, please call me at your convenience.

The Honorable Jeb Bush
Governor of Florida

Dear Governor Bush,

I appreciate your attention to my personal and professional endorsement
and recommendation of judicial applicant William "Bud" Hallman of
Brooksville for appointment to the new 5th Circuit Court judgeship.

I have previously written to you in detail through your General Counsel,
and reiterate my comments within that letter.

Mr. Hallman is eminently well qualified as a person and as an Attorney
to fill the vacant position on our circuit bench.  I know Bud to be of
the highest moral and ethical fiber and am proud to name him as my
friend and colleague.  Bud rightfully enjoys the respect and approbation
of his peers and community as a man of unquestioned integrity and
principle.  As an Attorney Bud is experienced and well versed across a
broad spectrum of law and practice.

It is my personal and professional opinion from some 26 years of
practice in Hernando County that Bud's appointment to the Circuit Court
would bring honor upon our court and our community and I unhesitatingly
offer him my unqualified support.

I thank you for your consideration of my recommendation and endorsement
of Bud's application for appointment.

Most Respectfully Yours,


James Martin Brown, Esquire

Report: State's schools continue to lag behind 

FLORIDA TODAY 




Yet another nationwide report on schools has been published and, no surprise, it contains more bad news for Florida. 


This time it's the U.S. Census Bureau that says Florida ranked 41st of the 50 states and the District of Columbia in per-student spending during the 2001-02 school year. 


Worse, the state ranked 51st -- a stunning dead last behind all the states and D.C. -- in the amount spent on public education per $1,000 of personal income. 


So what's the response of State Education Secretary Jim Horne? 


"Those kinds of rankings don't mean very much to me," he said when presented with the news. 


Well, they do to the parents of this state, Mr. Horne, and they do to us. 


And they certainly should to you, because you're the one paid plenty by the taxpayers to direct the state's education efforts. 


In case the meaning of the report slipped by, let us make it clear: It shows again in no uncertain terms the shameful results of a Legislature that has consistently underfunded education for Florida's children. 


It's unbelievable that the same state that launches humans into space in the most technologically advanced operation in history makes its children fight for the scraps that remain after the special interests have their way with the budget. 


Or that Florida, the fourth-largest state in the union, the state governed by Jeb Bush, the self-declared "education governor," spends less on each student than Georgia, South Carolina or Texas. At a puny $6,020 per student, the state is 17 percent below average. 


And what are the numbers that put us in last place after all the other states and D.C.? Florida spent $32.88 for every $1,000 residents earned in 2001, compared to the national average of $41.59 per $1,000 of personal income. 


For perspective, Arkansas, which is fighting to became a hub of well-paid industrial jobs and knows a well-educated workforce is the key, spends twice that, at $65.70. 


True, to meet growth needs, Florida must spend more than most other states on school construction. And spending on education rose 4.6 percent from 1997 to 2001, factoring in inflation and the increase in the number of students. 


Still, that amount left us ranking 35th, compared with the far greater increases in most other states. 


At least Senate President Jim King, R-Jacksonville, seems to understand the importance of education, especially to attract industry. He's sworn to a fight to get teachers at least the national average in salary, at $43,000 a year. The state's average now is $39,000. 


Fixing the schools will take money, which brings us back to Florida's desperate need for tax reform, starting with the $23 billion in service-tax exemptions that leave state coffers half-full. 


A more realistic tax structure could make Florida schools the envy of the nation. But until the Legislature and Bush have the guts to modernize an outdated and regressive tax structure, Florida will have to bear the shame of its "F" in education.

Pam, I am so grateful for your friendship and support. My reason for doing the National Day of Prayer is that I think my involvement outside Tallahassee enhances the effort. the Daytona experience validated this belief. If this is so important to you, I will do the Tallahassee event. I thought you were in charge of all of Florida. I want to help the cause. We should discuss. call me tomorrow.

Jeb,
 
I wanted to write and tell you that our prayers are with our troops and with your brother and his family and with your family. Dr. Dobson spoke on his program Friday about this being a just war and called on millions of Americans to prayer for our troops. President Bush is doing a great job and this is a war that must be fought!  I want you to know that the people who are part of the Bush Family Prayer Shield also have you all covered 24/7. These are very difficult times for the nation and the world and our hope must be in the Lord! 
 
You were missed on Thursday at the prayer breakfast. It was a wonderful breakfast. Toni Jennings did a good job. Great choice in picking Toni, by the way! I have always liked her. David and Debbie Griffin are attending our church now and he told me he was ready to be out of public service for now. Maybe someday he will serve again. He is a really good man and we are enjoying having him as part of our fellowship.
 
I have a question I really need to ask you. I was told that you do not want to attend the National Day of Prayer rally at the capitol, but want to participate somewhere else. I am grateful that you want to attend somewhere, but I don't understand why you do not want to attend the capitol event. Most of the conservative governors attend their capitol event. Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia's  governors will attended their services and we will confirm the rest of my region in  the next week or so (and across the nation many governors attend their capitol events, even the President host a service at the White House). I just feel bad that my own governor won't be attending here. Have I offended you in anyway? Does our capitol service offend you? I really need to know if I have said or done anything to offend you, if so please forgive me. My heart has always been to serve our state and nation in prayer and to serve your family in prayer. I am truly sorry for last year's service offending Columba and I am trying to make amends. Well, I hope you understand my heart. I am truly grateful for your participation wherever you decide, most of all thank you for praying. I just want to make things right if I have messed up in any way, I know I have a big mouth and I insert my foot and sometimes my whole leg and get myself in trouble, I told you in it is the bossy Texan in me, anyway, again, PLEASE FORGIVE ME!. May prayers are with Columba and you both for comfort in these difficult days.
 
In case you need to contact me in the future, please make note of my new email address: pam@floridaprayer.org
 
Much blessings and prayers,
Pam

Subject: FTAA BOT meeting


As you learned from Ines’ email earlier this morning, the Florida FTAA, Inc. Search Committee, chaired by Dominique Virchaux (SpencerStuart) and ably assisted by Marco Munoz (Heidrick & Struggles), Ambassador Manuel Rocha (Steel Hector), Carlos de la Cruz (Eagle Brands) and Jesse Manzano (Governor Bush’s office), has selected Jorge Arrizurieta as its number-one candidate to be the Executive Director of Florida FTAA, Inc.  
 
We have called a special Board meeting for Friday, March 28, at 9 a.m. in the offices of Steel Hector to approve this recommendation where Dominique will give a full report of his executive search committee. 
 
Briefly, Jorge is the United States’ alternate representative in the InterAmerican Development Bank and was previously a senior executive for Wayne Huizenga, the Florida Marlins, AutoNations and other companies controlled by Wayne Huizenga.  Earlier, he was in charge of Senator Connie Mack’s operations in Florida and before that an executive with Alec Courtelis, who was the finance chairman for President George H.W. Bush.  Jorge is an excellent leader, a team builder who has a comprehensive knowledge of this hemisphere, an excellent understanding of U.S. policy development in Washington, superb insights on policy formulation in Tallahassee and an in-depth familiarity with the South Florida region.  In addition to strong support from the Search Committee, he is endorsed by policymakers in Washington, Governor Bush and his staff, his former employers Wayne Huizenga and Connie Mack and many other leading Floridians.  We hope you can come to the meeting and hear the full report by Dominique Virchaux and the Search Committee and meet with Jorge and ask him any questions you might have.  
 
As we discussed at the last FTAA Board meeting and at the Board meeting of the Ministerial and ABF last week, we are developing task forces for each of the 33 countries in this hemisphere.  We would like each of our board members to adopt at least one country that you will visit at least once prior to the November Ministerial to advocate Miami as the site of the FTAA Secretariat and to answer questions regarding the Ministerial in November.  Some of these meetings will be with Governor Bush or with other Florida FTAA officials.  Further, we would expect each of these 33 task forces to host their country’s delegations -- both the government delegation of Ministers and Vice Ministers and the businessmen delegation to the ABF during the November Ministerial and ABF.  
 
At the meeting on Friday, will be ask each of you to pick which country task force you would like to join.  For those that cannot attend the meeting, we will follow up with another notice.  
 
We look forward to seeing you on Friday at 9 a.m.

Governor Jeb,

I hate bothering you, but here is a person severelly disabled that I
have know for many years that her and the company she works for have
been a loyal supporter of our party that truly needs your assistance.
If there is anything your office can do to assist or recommend please
do
so.  She works while being disabled and still has worked your entire
life for a company called Digital SOuth Communication.  I have called
on
this individual and her employer many times for support of the cause
of
our party and they have allways given without thought.  Please assist
in
helping find a solution for this wonderful lady.

P.S.  Audrey can be reached at 727-441-2700





Paul, I just wanted to know if you knew where I could send my plea for
intercession if it comes to that.  I tried to be as brief as I could.
If you need clarification, please call me. Thank you, appreciate
whatever advise you can render.  Audrey

In 1997, case # 90017779CI, I contacted the Dept. of Revenue Child
Support Enforcement Division, in order to get court ordered child
support as well as court ordered spousal support.  At that time the
children were 15 & 17.

He lives out of state, and basically all this time he has been doing
many legal maneuverings, to avoid paying court ordered support.  He
has
hired attorneys in NJ as well as FL.  

Finally, in 12/2000 he voluntarily had his wages garnished, thus
bypassing NJ enforcement of the Florida order.  The net effect of that
was when he lost his job in Jan 2001, there was no garnishment of his
unemployment checks.  

In order for him to once again be garnished he had to be brought back
to
court once again in NJ.  He was served papers and ordered to appear. 
He
then rehired the FL attorney to file motions in Florida, in order to
postpone the NJ hearings.

We had a hearing scheduled for 12/31/02, but at the last minute, (and
I
was never notified) his attorney canceled stating that he did not know
it was a DOR case.
Which is not correct, as he was the same attorney who represented him
in
12/00.

From what I understand, my ex's attorney does not think the State of
Florida should be representing me as my children have reached
majority.


This was brought up 2 years ago and I found the following, "A child
support enforcement hearing officer is an attorney who has been
appointed by administrative order of the court to take testimony and
recommend decision in cases involving the establishment, enforcement,
and/or modification of child support and the enforcement of alimony in
conjunction with an ongoing child support arrearage order."

I believe based on that, the state continued to enforce my spousal
support because it was all part of the original court order.  

They (my ex and his FL attorney) are trying now to get the State of
Florida out of the picture, because they know full well, I have
limited
financial means and would not be able to continue the legal battle for
him to pay his arrears and continued spousal support.

The state's attorney told me, that it is up to the DOR on how they
interpret the Florida statues.  He said that I would know in about 3
weeks if they would continue to pursue the matter.  He said that I may
have to hire an attorney, (economically impossible) or go it on my
own.

I did not want to wait to the last minute, and wanted someone --
somewhere to know of this and the damaging precedent it could create.
That parents who avoid paying, by manipulating the system to their
advantage (filing motions, etc.) to avoid paying court ordered support
till the child or children reach majority. So they can then say, well
children our of age why are you still representing her?  

This to me is an outrage.  I am disabled, and have raised 2 children
alone, worked 2 jobs, and among family, friends and our church we got
along.  I am proud to say without any public assistance.  

If the DOR bows out from my case, I will not be able to pursue him. I
am
trying to locate someone in government now, make them aware of my
present circumstances, and if necessary could and would be willing to
intercede on my behalf with DOR to continue with my case should it
come
to that.

Thank you,

Audrey

Subject:	Tallahassee Meeting RE Public Corruption in Bay County

Wendy,
 
We were in Tallahassee this past week on other business and stopped by to see you or someone in legal to ascertain the position of the governor regarding investigation of corrupt activities in Bay County involving control of the Grand Jury and Grand Jury fraud, continuing selective prosecution and prosecutorial misconduct by state attorney Appleman, false arrests, falsifications and obstruction of criminal proceedings and records, etc. as detailed in the substantial prior material set to you, legal, and the governor.  There is even new material available since our past communications.  Because nothing is done to deter this conduct, it continues unabated.
 
However, we were not afforded an opportunity to speak to anyone in legal while in Tallahassee.  Furthermore, the receptionist, whom I discussed with Nancy, was very uncooperative and hostile.  I would ask that she be counseled on customer service skills.
 
Nancy wanted to schedule a meeting this Thursday with you in Tallahassee.  I understand you are now working in Jacksonville and only come to Tallahassee every couple of weeks.  We cannot be ready to come by Thursday so Nancy informed us that you may be back again in a week or two.
 
We do not want to make a trip to Tallahassee merely to be told the governor will not do anything.  You can send us a letter to that affect and save us all time and expense.
 
If we are going to address the issues we have raised towards a goal of getting the governor, the Attorney General, and the Cabinet, sitting as head of FDLE, to take appropriate action on the issue we’ve raised, a meeting would then serve to clarify the issues involved.
 
The answer lies in whether or not the governor will do anything, or nothing.  He has the power to encourage and direct investigation of these matters by FDLE and to take action under the Florida Constitution as to impeachment for malfeasance, misfeasance, etc.  Sitting with the Cabinet in its constitutional capacity as head of FDLE, the governor and the Cabinet can review these matters for direction to FDLE and oversight.
 
By statute, authorized by the Florida Constitution, the Attorney General has supervisory and direction authority over Appleman and every other state attorney in Florida.  However, this oversight has been lacking.
 
Therefore, we do not, and will not, as a matter of constitutional and statutory law, accept a position from the governor that he “can’t” look into these matters because this is not true.  If it is his position that he “won’t” look into these matters then we have a right to know this as citizens so that we can petition political change during the next governor’s race in Florida.
 
We have suffered retributions and suppression of our rights in Bay County for too long and believe that the governor, Attorney General, and FDLE, when properly performing their duties, can be a solution to our concerns and a means of deterrence to future misconduct in Bay County.
 
Please let us know when we can have at least an hour to discuss these matters at least a week away for planning purposes.  Again, as I originally asked, we would like to have a representative there from FDLE, possibly Craig Rockenstein, and someone from the AG’s office who understands the principles embodied in the statutory and constitutional citations cited below.
 
Please FAX us a letter setting the date and time for the meeting and outlining the purpose and objectives of the meeting from your perspective.
 
Best wishes and hope the baby is doing fine.

Governor Bush,

 

Not to beat a dead horse, but since we emailed Saturday, we have learned the entire anti-tobacco program ($37.341 million in your budget) has been zeroed-out. Totally eliminated. While we understand the incoming trust fund monies are down 12.6% from last year, the total elimination of the program just doesn't seem justified. Especially in light of the results generated and lives saved.

 

Thank you in advance for your help with this issue.

This company may be a good contact for a large book donation request. Info
can be found at www.scholastic.com/about scholastic/community/programs. I
think 100,000 books is too large a resource for DCF to handle but may work
well for other large 501C3 groups. They also have a Hispanic Teacher of the
year award and are working with the largest school districts in the nation.
Miami is mentioned so I am sure we may have accessed this resource on a
state level. If not here it is. Lake County Sheriff with their tractor
trailer would be a good resource to pick up the donation and diminish
shipping charges.
                                                                                            
                                                                                            
                                                                                            
                                                                                            
                                                                                            
                                                                                            
                                                                                            
 Scholastic also initiates the majority of its in-kind donations as well. Through the       
 Scholastic Book Grants program, an in-kind giving initiative, the company seeks to provide 
 books and other reading materials to nonprofit organizations that serve children and       
 families in need. Annually, the company identifies several organizations to receive        
 large-scale grants of 100,000 or more books. Organizations selected to receive these large 
 grants are challenged to demonstrate how they will creatively use the donation to meet the 
 literacy needs of at-risk children. The issuing of these grants is directed by the Company 
 and is not in response to unsolicited requests. Large-scale grant recipients are           
 identified in September every year. Scholastic will disburse smaller book grants and other 
 in-kind donations as well.

Jeb,
In my capacity (since April 2002), as President of Tropic-Kool
Engineering 
(TKE), I've become aware of an issue that I think you'll find
interesting and 
if you agree, I'd like you to introduce me to Diane Carr, your secretary
of 
the division of regulation and compliance.
Here is the story, TKE was founded in 1978 to provide mechanical
engineering 
and contracting for the Burger King chain of restaurants on a national
basis. 
 It has survived and at times thrived in that capacity to this day.  A
few 
years ago a few TKE employees left and started their own firm, National 
Corporate Account Services, Inc. (NCA).  They have recently been
competing 
with us on a national basis for business with Dunkin Donuts.  While they

claim they are merely a supplier of HVAC related products, their actions
and 
inclusion into the plans for Dunkin Donut projects indicates they may
indeed 
be acting as a contractor in this state as well as others.  TKE's
general 
manager is licensed in over 20 states and the costs associated with that
in 
time and money are significant.  We have consulted our corporate
attorney and 
he believes we have enough evidence to take them to Federal court for
unfair 
trade practices.  The state of Florida's Department of Business and 
Professional Regulation has issued a notice and order to cease and
desist on 
one project in Orlando (DBPR case # 2002-015128).
My question and concern is that they continue the practice and recently
won 
another Dunkin Donut job in Florida and we believe they are still not 
licensed in this state or any other (not your problem, I know).  While I

realize there is little that can be done on your end and they are
innocent 
until proven guilty, our business suffers while operators such as these
who 
avoid the associated expenses of playing by the rules can win contracts.

My hope is Diane Carr or her staff might have some ideas that could help
us 
level the playing field.
Sincerely,
Peter

Please don't let us get to the point where we loose 2,000 to 4,000 homes before you do anything to help our city.  I have only been a city commissioner for a year and a half and it is very disappointing to me to see the blame game and politics that go on during this emergency.  We have people who can't live in their homes and those who are going to loose their homes if we get another four to six inches of rain.  We are not crying wolf!  We need you to declare a State of Emergency for our city.  Please, Please, Please come see for yourself.

At this point, I think so.  It is a peer review process at NIH and the review panel is confidential at this point.  Boyden thinks he can do much more through the Senate contacts who "march to the beat of a different drum".  Perhaps re-enforcement in that department from your Washington office may complement his efforts.

Boyden has agreed to be one of our speakers for our BioFlorida Annual Conference October 19 and 20 (Sunday/Monday).  I am aware that EFI has invited you to speak as well.  It would be great to have you and Boyden as a team.  Any chance?

Dear Governor Bush,

As you requested during our meeting in January, I am providing an update
on the State's and Sunol's efforts to support our RFP for developing
treatments for bioterrorism agents.   

1.  Teleconference with Brett Doster and Dan Ostergaard, Washington
office, resulted in suggestions to inform as many departments and
legislators as possible to insure global knowledge should any inquiries
be made about the submission.  Suggestions included DOH, State and
Federal legislators, EFI, State Chamber of Commerce.  At Dan's
suggestion, a one page brief was prepared that delineated the economic
benefits of receiving the award.  (See attached)

2.  Your office sent information to Dr. John Agwunobi, Secretary for
Health.  Information exchange and discussions have subsequently ensued
with Dr. Phillip Amuso, Assistant Bureau Chief and Laboratory Director,
Florida Department of Health.  Dr. Amuso put Sunol in contact with
investigators at USF (Dr. Ken Ugen) for collaboration opportunities.

3.  David Gury wrote a letter of support to Congressman Clay Shaw.

4.  Boyden Gray is contacting Senator Graham.

5.  EFI will feature a paragraph in their "Developments" newsletter.
They have also sent the RFP brief to Selina Griffith at DOH.

6.  Sunol is making contact with Dr. Donna Shalala to gain her support
and discuss collaborative opportunities between UM and Sunol.

Best regards,
Claire

Dear Governor Bush:
This E-mail is concerning the appointment of nomination and hopefully the appointment of Morgan Laur Reinman to the vacant Eighteenth Circuit Judge position.  I have been a Brevard County resident for over thirty years and have owned and operated a CPA firm for over ten years.  I have known Morgan Reinman for many years and have watched her become one of the finest family attorneys that I have ever worked with.  She has all the characteristics and experience that I believe are mandatory for the job of Circuit Judge.  She is extremely intelligent yet does not place herself above or talk down to others.  She is a fair and patient individual with an outstanding moral code.  Mrs. Reinman always follows through on what she  
promises, which I find rare in the practice of law (I have dealings with many attorneys).  She is also a devoted Mom and understands the balance and pressures of home Vs career which is something that unfortunately a few the judges that I have had the opportunity to work with have forgotten.  I could go on and on about her accomplishments, character, ethics, experience, etc., but I know you have other important matters taking up your time.  

She is also a staunch supporter of yours and has the following picture of the two of you in her waiting room. 




I just want to say that I know she is the best qualified person for the job. 
Thank you for taking the time to read my views and consider what I have to say.  

Sincerely,

Jay N. Edinger, CPA

March 25, 02 

Dear Governor Bush: 


My Family and myself are life time Republicans and have been great supporters of you and one thing in particular your stand on keeping the Bright Futures Scholarship for everyone, thereby allowing all the deserving to share in our state lottery proceeds. 

The article in toadies Lakeland Ledger upset us a great deal as we are both educators and in that 75,000 range and have one girl at FSU on bright futures and one in high school who is working very hard in order to be awarded the bright futures scholarship do agree with the bill in the Florida House that world increase the SAT score needed for the Medallion Scholarship from 970 to 1050. However, we feel it would be a terrible to make Bright Futures Need based or to place caps on tuition amounts. Governor Bush please don't let this happen now or in the future. This is perhaps the best thing that has ever happened to all college students in FL. 

Back in 1971 my parents combined income was less than $4,000. I was awarded an economic opportunity grant to go to FSU only to find out when I got there it was recended because I wasn't culturally deprived. Unlike this terrible injustice the Bright Futures program awards anyone who is willing to work and it is great.

	        First, the student government of the University of West Florida

	        taking a lobbying trip to Tallahassee on Thursday, March 27th.
	We will

	        Second, I spoke a few days ago with Jeremy Buxton (Jeremy was

	        American Legion Boy's State Governor for the 2000 delegation).
	He
	        mentioned he spent a few days in Tallahassee "shadowing" you. I
	was
	        Jeremy's Lt. Governor that year and was wondering and hoping I
	could

Subject:	Medicaid Task Force--sch change

Today’s Medicaid Task Force staff meeting was not a step forward…it was kind-of a running-in-place.

We reviewed the NGA Medicaid Reform principles.  And, determined that we had collected the 10 Governors’ 5 top issues.  But we were unable to review them since NGA had not had a chance to compile them in any kind of comparison grid.

Karen and I had spent a few hours reviewing the Republican top 5 Medicaid challenges and compiled our own comparison (attached), for our own purposes. We shared this w/ the NGA Task Force staff (to Republican staff surprise…they did not know that we took the time to look at their measures), and concluded that it would help Governors to see the similarities and some differences in our respective state Medicaid challenges.  The comparison will be released to Governors tomorrow or at least by Friday, for your review and in preparation for next week’s call.

Tomorrow’s call for Governors’ is cancelled.  We will instead have a task force staff meeting to review the 10 Govs’ top 5 challenges.  (Letterman-like, but tragically funny :-))

During tomorrow’s staff meeting, we have been asked to review the Breaux and Bingaman/Dingell proposals.  Our feeling (and that of our R colleagues) is that these are non-starters.  We might be able to find some common ground, but our read at this time, is that the Medicaid proposal that will move forward is the Administration’s.

Gov/Kathleen---pls see next e-mail.

Thanks, Nina.

Governor/Kathleen---this raises the issue of DC meetings.  The first DC meeting is Thurs, April 10, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.  It will be a critical day as Medicaid-goes.  At this point Karen and I feel it will be a make-or-break point for a bi-partisan reform effort.  It will only be this personal interaction between the 10 Governors (and we think that 7 are definitely confirmed), Congressional Leadership and Sec Thompson that will determine the course of the effort.   It is obvious to us that you are the stronger player in the effort, but we understand your scheduling conflicts.  Pls advise.  Nina

		Governor-----this isn’t an easy job.  In fact it’s been fairly painful to sit through discussion after discussion “on process” and we haven’t even gotten to the “meat of things.”

		After various independent discussions w/ staff (Kempthorne, Rowland, Hoeven, and Thompson, as examples), if w/in the next few days (certainly by this Friday), if we don’t get a sense that we are moving forward, we will continue to work this process but also begin to work directly w/ Congress and the Administration on a definitive proposal.  Florida cannot wait.

		We will call Kathleen w/ details.  Nina.

Was just at the Pompano Turnpike rest station and was disturb to see a very

displaying the peace symbol.

I strongly feel it sends a wrong message to the users of the Turnpike.

Banner looks like this:

Dear Governor Bush,

It is with a great deal of pleasure that I recommend Morgan Laur Reinman, P.A.
to you for the vacant position on the Eighteenth Judicial Circuit Court.  
Morgan is an excellent attorney and highly thought of by her peers.

Morgan has been President of the Brevard County Bar Association; Trustee for 
Big Brother/Big Sister; the Board of Directors for  Brevard County Legal Aid 
and many other community organizations.

Having worked with County Judges and Circuit Judges in my capacity as former 
Brevard County Commissioner, I know how important it is to have qualified 
individuals in these positions.  Morgan, not only has the technical ability, 
but she also has the demeanor and compassion to be appointed to the Circuit 
bench.

I would ask for your consideration in the appointment of Morgan Laur Reinman 
to the Eighteenth Judicial Circuit Court.

Sincerely,

Subject: RE: Disease Management


Lifemasters serves a small portion of our Medicaid population- patients with Congestive Heart Failure who live in Northeast Florida. They have a relatively good program in terms of services provided but in the past, they have not produced the level of savings mutually agreed upon.  We now pay this vendor for this program's administration  (no  risk, no guarantee, no reconciliation process) and at the end of the year, we internally assess the programs level of savings and service delivery - savings are not guaranteed.
 
Before we consider expanding existing programs or adding new disease management programs - need to make sure you are comfortable with the fact that the health care savings for disease management programs in general typically come years into a program -if it is done right.  We already have about 6 disease management programs. Might be better to fine tune the promising ones we already have and weed out others.
 
If the preference now is on initiatives that provide quick and more immediate cost savings- would hold on adding more disease mgt.
 
Current question & debate about the value added disease mgt programs is whether to stay the course with the program,(current  invest in a program focused on out-year cost reductions)  vs. "cashing out" now with a quick money fix (rebate everything).  At least with the value added disease management programs we are guaranteed a savings and the amount of the guarantee can be negotiated now at contract renewal.    Working with Kathleen, etc on summary info describing clinical outcomes and anecdotal patient successes. Plan to have this to her within the next day.  Reconcilliation process negotiations about the actual program savings still going on with Pfizer
 
PS: Bob also tells me LifeMasters was disqualified by CMS/Medicare last week.  He is looking into what happened.....

Dear Governor Bush: 

I saw an article yesterday announcing that you are part of a task force appointed by the National Governor's Association to help President Bush formulate Medicaid "reform" policy.

I would like to offer you my assistance in the area of Disease Management which has been shown to have great potential to reduce healthcare costs in Medicaid populations while improving the quality of care provided to beneficiaries.  I have been working in the disease management field for more than seven years and have a great deal of experience that I can share both at the operational level and at the policy level as a result of being on the Board of Directors and Chairman of the Government Affairs and Health Policy Committee of the Disease Management Association of America.

I am the CEO of LifeMasters Supported SelfCare, a woman-owned/managed business which is in its third year of providing disease management services to your Medicaid beneficiaries in the northern half of Florida with Congestive Heart Failure.  During this time, we have worked with almost 8,000 beneficiaries and we have been achieving excellent clinical and satisfaction results and have generated significant net savings for the state.  In addition, we are currently awaiting final approval from CMS on a large scale demonstration project to provide disease management services to dual eligible beneficiaries in Florida.

Should you need any information or wish to speak with me directly about the LifeMasters program or disease management in general, please do not hesitate to contact me.

I want to thank you for your continued support of disease management and for the opportunity to serve these particularly needy beneficiaries in Florida - it has been a most rewarding experience for me and my staff and we hope for the opportunity to continue and perhaps expand our relationship.

Dear Governor Bush,
I am an attorney who has practiced law in the

and a former partner of ex-senator David McClain, the
only elected Republican in Hillsborough county in the
late 1970's. I whole-heartedly endorse Bud Hallman as
a circuit judge in the Fifth Circuit.
Bud's career has involved criminal law (state
attorney) and civil law (primarily family and probate
litigation), so he should be able to handle
immediately any area to which he is assigned. He
possesses the character and thoughtfulness necessary
for a good judge.
I hope you appoint him--I think he will be a good
choice.
Thankyou for your kind consideration,
Yours,

Hey Jeb,
 
I know you are aware of the great success we've had as Florida's first conversion charter school - McKeel Academy.  One of our dreams has been to open an K-12 charter school that feeds into our existing 6-12 program.  Last week, we successfully closed on the property immediately across Florida Avenue from Lawton Chiles Middle Academy in Lakeland and we expect the elementary school to be open by August.  Preliminary estimates based all of the financials on a student population of 300, however we have over 550 student applications already.
 
All of this to let you know that we will be breaking ground on the elementary renovation project at 4:00 April 15th.  Adam Putnam, the Mayor and I will be doing the groundbreaking and Jennifer Leigh from NewsChannel 8 will be our emcee.  I thought if it was possible for you to be in the area, I would love to have you there - we really are a shining success of the Charter School initiative across the country.  
 
In addition, we have coordinated the groundbreaking with a very large community event (Florida's only public outdoor sculpture competition) in Downtown Lakeland, described by the City's press release below. 
 
Look forward to hearing from you - would love to have you there.
 
 
Thanks!

Subject:	Autism Insurance Bill 169and MEDWAIVER

Dear Governor Bush;
As a parent to 3 children all of whom are diagnosed with some degree of autism... I urge, 
plead and beg you to support the Autism Insurance Bill 169 and help the disaster of the 
Medwaiver waiting list and funding.  Our children did not get the 
early intervention they should have because we could not afford the therapy.  Of Course 
our insurance denies all benefits relating to autism and the necessary therapies.  Now 
our kids are in mediocre (at best) public school programs where the teachers aren't 
trained and the few therapists have way too many kids to treat.  Our system truly is a 
tragedy and I am embarrased to be living in a state where we are the last of the 50 in 
budgets for developmental disabilities.
It is hard for me to comprehend  why this is such an issue.  Other brain disorders are 
covered.  Cancer is covered.  Can you explain to me why autism isn't covered?  Is this 
your doing? Is this because the insurance companies donate a lot of money to campaign 
funds?  
The saddest part is that the state will definetly have to support my kids  soon (VERY 
SOON) because the insurance wouldn't provide coverage to help them become 
independent and productive. From what I understand that will cost the state $75,000 to 
$85,000 per year per child. YIKES!  Sounds like a lot of money to me.   Is this penny wise 
and pound foolish??  It is obvious to me that the only thing to do is to support the Autism 
Insurance Bill 169.  I hope it is obvious to you too. There is plenty of scientific data that 
proves that early interventiion can totally change the life of an autistic child into a 
productive working adult.  I wish my kids had had the chance.  No, my kids won't attend 
Bolles or Ransom or Gulliver Academy, but they deserve every opportunity  coming to 
them .
Thanks for your support.

Dear Governor Bush:

Thanks for your note.  As Alan may have told you, I will be returning 
to Florida (my home for the majority of my life) and specifically 
Gainesville in July to serve on the University of Florida faculty as an 
Assistant Professor of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery.  I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to serve as a Reserve Air Force Officer 
and hope to do so at one of the fine bases in our state.

I have been in Texas for the past 8 months doing a fellowship in 
Reconstructive Microsurgery at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.  
MD Anderson has an excellent policy of providing salary supplements and 
continued benefits to those called to serve our nation at this time of 
crisis.  The hospital will pay the difference between the civilian and 
military salaries for all of those called to active duty for the first 
6 months of their service.  Although I am not familiar with the state 
of Florida's policy on this issue, I hope that it is similar.

On my return to Florida I will be registering as a Republican (although 
I voted for you and the President as a Dem) and I would be honored to 
assist your administration in any way that you think might be helpful.

Again, thanks for your note and for all that you do for the citizens of 
Florida.  My thoughts and prayers are with the President in this time 
of conflict and with the brave men and women who are serving our 
country in the Middle East and around the world.

Sincerely,

Dear Governor Bush, 
 
Warm greetings to you, our Governor!  I am writing tonight on behalf of and in full support of Sanford attorney Clay Simmons in his quest to become your appointee for the Circuit Court seat that is being filled in our 18th Judicial Circuit. 
 
I have written to you once before, on behalf of (now-Circuit Judge) Donna McIntosh, who also received an appointment from you.  We are pleased with her performance and assure you that she is a continuing credit to your good judgment.  (By the way, thank you for the lovely letter I received from your office following her appointment.)  
 
Regarding Clay Simmons:  I have known Clay as a friend, an attorney and as a colleague of my husband Carmine Bravo (a Seminole County Court Judge) for over 15 years.  I consider him to be a true gentleman, and incidently, a scholar. He is a loving husband and a "hands-on" father, and is involved in our community in numerous ways.  I have personal knowledge of his skill in the practice of the law, and appreciate his courtroom demeanor.  I am quite satisfied that he would make an excellent Judge...one who would contribute positively to the reputation of the Judiciary in our State.
 
With a fine understanding of the law, and the ability to "read" people well, (which would give him an edge on the bench), Clay is one with whom you won't go wroing!  May I urge you to seriously regard him when determining your choice for this Circuit slot!  Thank you for your prayerful consideration in this matter.  
 
My love and blessings to you and your family...(in both our State and National Capitols.) You are all in my heart and prayers!
 
Sincerely, 
Maureen Bravo

Subject: Body Armor: FlaNG Soldiers


Governor,
   Wed/26 Mar/ 12:20 AM

I just got off the phone with one of my Commanders in a country adjoining
Irag.  He is scheduled to engage in the near future into the combat area we
see on CNN/Fox..

Fla Nat'l Guard soldiers DO NOT have the "Ranger Body Armor" (RBA) that the
active duty soldiers have at the same location. Both active duty Army
soldiers and our Guardsmen are about to move out together for the objective.


Our soldiers have the "80's" era Flak Vests....inferior to the RBA. They
were supposed to get the RBA at the "Mobilization" station, but for whatever
reason this didn't happen. We put energy into the issue back in Jan and Feb.

Our commander in the theater assures me he will be able to work this, but
that was the same message of several weeks ago. Theater requirements dictate
the better body armor.

We have worked this. Apparently my info is accurate. Several sources I have
contacted tonight confirm our concerns.

Certainly there is a better explanation that I don't see,  I want to be
sensitive to "second guessing" the leadership in the Army who have
apparently "sanctioned" this, but the phone call to the AOR is certainly
confirmation the Guard was omitted in the equipment promise.

Thanks for your concern for our troops.

Respectfully,

Subject: Tort reform


Dear Gov. Bush,
    I've heard so much about the need in tort reform and caps on medical mal-practice cases - a very emotional subject with strong opinions all around.  Well, I'm a small-press publisher and rising insurance costs and availability of quality doctors in our great state is a concern to us as well.  I have a suggestion as a businessman which has not yet been discussed in the media to my knowledge.  Instead of determining a cap amount on mal-practice cases, it would be much more practical in such cases to pay them their average wages (say over last five years), plus cost of living increases along with covering their follow-up medical expenses for life.  This way, both a neurosurgeon making millions per year or a receptionist at the bottom of the wage scale if affected by malpractice, both their current lifestyles would be maintained with no need for attorneys to become involved.  Certainly, there will always be a few cases which do not fit the norm (students, etc.) and those settlements could be determined by the legislature or by independent arbitration process appointed by the Governor, etc.  The actuarial rates for these cases could easily be covered and the losses recovered much easier by the insurance industry.  A close example of this kind of actuarial rating is what already exists for life insurance.  Since everyone is terminal, the rates are based on having to pay with 100% certainty, but the monies are invested and the benefits are paid out of profits earned over many years of millions of participants.  
    On the other side of this issue is the fact that a high percentage of people receiving millions in one-time payouts are often not experienced money managers and often fall prey to every scheme in the world, making several bad decisions and sometime winding up back on the public payroll through the result of poor money management skills.  
    A life-long pay out would eliminate most of these issues and would remove the incentive for litigation, since the cause would have already been decided.  What could be more fair than this?  No one gets instantly rich, including the personal injury lawyers, but neither is one devastated by medical mistakes and forced into a life of poverty along with possible pain and suffering.
    I'm sure I could design a plan to work with these goals in mind - one which could be fair to the patient and yet allow affordable insurance for the medical industry.
    Your thoughts would be welcomed in this matter.
 
Your friend (still praying for Noel),
Lance Coalson

Hey Jeb,
 
I know you are aware of the great success we've had as Florida's first conversion charter school - McKeel Academy.  One of our dreams has been to open an K-12 charter school that feeds into our existing 6-12 program.  Last week, we successfully closed on the property immediately across Florida Avenue from Lawton Chiles Middle Academy in Lakeland and we expect the elementary school to be open by August.  Preliminary estimates based all of the financials on a student population of 300, however we have over 550 student applications already.
 
All of this to let you know that we will be breaking ground on the elementary renovation project at 4:00 April 15th.  Adam Putnam, the Mayor and I will be doing the groundbreaking and Jennifer Leigh from NewsChannel 8 will be our emcee.  I thought if it was possible for you to be in the area, I would love to have you there - we really are a shining success of the Charter School initiative across the country.  
 
In addition, we have coordinated the groundbreaking with a very large community event (Florida's only public outdoor sculpture competition) in Downtown Lakeland, described by the City's press release below. 
 
Look forward to hearing from you - would love to have you there.
 
 
Thanks!

By a majority vote the Board has recommended to Governor Bush that David
Moore be appointed to take the place of Sonny Vergera, his replacement. As
all familiar with the Withlacoochee watershed problems know, Mr. Moore was
Peter Hubbell's shadow during our blackest days fighting for accountable
representation. There has been a fierce behind the scenes fight these last
years for the old guard Swiftmud staff to regain power. This move will show
their success. If the Governor makes this appointment we are back to square
one! In fact, in the opinion of this writer our area will be even worse off
than under Hubbell, look out Local Sources First. TOO FAR must react to this
crisis immediately by contacting the Governor against the choice. L. C.

Kyle's budget fattened for ECC

College would get $31 million under his proposal

By Alisa LaPolt, The News-Press Tallahassee Bureau

	

TALLAHASSEE - In a meager House budget that funds no new judges or water restoration projects, budget Chairman Bruce Kyle got $31 million for a community college in his hometown. 


Under Kyle's House budget, Edison Community College would receive more state construction money than any other college or university - more even than the University of Florida and Florida State University combined. 


Kyle also penciled into the budget $7 million for the Miami-Dade Community College to buy Freedom Tower, a historical building located across the street from its Wolfson campus. 


The project, sought by House Republican Leader Marco Rubio of Miami, would hold humanities classes, lobbyist Victoria Hernandez said. 


Neither project was in line for state funding. The Freedom Tower acquisition is absent from Miami-Dade's long-range wish list of capital outlay funding. And Edison college's library and health sciences buildings originally were set to be done during the next three to five years. 


Kyle offered no apologies during a Tuesday budget briefing, where his budget lieutenants outlined budget cuts. There is no House money to add trial court judges, or to continue with ongoing water cleanup projects. 


The House budget trims Bright Futures scholarships, uses trust fund money that finances home loans for low-income buyers, and cuts university funding by $84 million. 


"I don't think we should feel intimidated by the constraints of the lists that are put out by colleges and universities," Kyle said. 


A budget released last week by the Senate would fund far less for Edison projects - roughly $4 million for various building renovations and additional classrooms. 


Sen. Ken Pruitt, a former House budget chief who padded his own budget four years ago with $15 million for his local community college, avoided criticizing Kyle. Instead, the Senate budget chairman pointed out his own chamber is not funding lawmakers' special projects this year. 


"I'm not going to say that projects are not worthy," he said Tuesday. "We're limiting ours - and it's not going to be leadership getting theirs." 


As of Tuesday, with the deadline for amendments drawing near, senators had held off on trying to insert their projects into the budget bill, Pruitt said. 


Florida lawmakers have not passed a turkey-free budget since 1991, and the feat was so unusual even lawmakers questioned whether special projects were not tucked away within the massive bill. 


Officials from other community colleges were both surprised and irked upon realizing Tuesday that their own budgets are sacrificed as a result of Kyle's generosity. 


"If they want to fund these projects, fine, (but) don't take away from existing projects," said Larry Bracken, lobbyist for Pensacola Junior College, which gets $3.5 million in the Senate budget but only $1.8 million in the House copy. 


"That's a leaky roof that won't get fixed or an air conditioning unit that won't get repaired," Bracken said. 


Brevard Community College, which finished welcome centers at two locations and renovated its aging Cocoa campus, would see its $3.2 million allocation drop to $2.3 million under the House budget. 


"They added several projects that were not on the community college list," spokeswoman Ingrid Bradley said. "We are disappointed." 


Florida State University would receive $800,000 to expand its Panama City campus, and the University of Florida would see $12 million for a library expansion. 


Jim Slusher, president of Edison's campus in Fort Myers, said administrators had requested funding for projects stretching over a few years, and was pleased that Kyle moves the work ahead of schedule. 


"We made a case and the legislators moved it up," he said. "You know, we haven't had an appropriations chairman from here before." 


Kyle is the first budget chair from Southwest Florida in modern times. 


Slusher said the $31 million is needed for renovations and repairs especially at Edison's Collier campus, as well as the former University of South Florida buildings now used on Edison's main campus in Fort Myers. 


Specific projects include a child care facility at the Collier campus and a building for the college's golf course maintenance program. 


"We do have that much in needs," Slusher said. "The buildings are sound, but they need some renovations for classroom space. A lot of those buildings haven't had a total upgrade."

Good morning Governor Bush.  I just want to follow-up, from the
Miami-Dade perspective, on the correspondence you had with Edith
Lederberg regarding Local Service Program dollars.  In Miami-Dade, five
agencies receive LSP dollars.  They include: The Cities of Sweetwater
and West Miami, Little Havana Activities and Nutriton Centers,
Miami-Dade Community Action Agency, and Southwest Social Services.  The
budget of $746,118 inlcudes providing 79,885 congregate meals, 70, 564
home delivered meals, 46,931 one way trips, 56,552 units of recreation,
and screening and assessment  to 272 seniors.  Cuts or elimination of
the LSP Program would be devasting to the seniors of Miami-Dade County. 
Thank you for your interest and concern.

Shortly after the May event in Tampa, I was very excited after I talked with you and Ms. Vega on the issue of Lucy's Spin Art Machine.  You then visited us last month.  Even though we were disappointed that we only received a sketch of the art machine, we were hopeful that Lucy was going to receive the machine soon after that day.  As you know, the spin art machine is a tool that will help Lucy in her transition goal to develop her art business upon graduation from HS.  She now has less than two years to work with the machine.   Two years to learn a skill may seem a long time, but it took Lucy about 5 years of continuos practice to learn to eat with minimal assistance. She has now been waiting for a positive rehabilitation engineering outcome for some 3 years.

 

The quest for Rehabilitation Engineering services is beyond what I could have ever imagined.  It dates back to 1999 when Rehab. engineering was still part of the state's VRS system.  We have already experienced VR Rehab. engineers (that later became USF's engineers), USF students, and now it seems a private vendor.  All of that, and nothing useful to account for has been developed.  

 

It is not comfortable to write this note, but not only as Lucy's parent, but as an advocate for people with disabilities I feel responsible to address the situation, not only on a personal basis, but on a broader systemic basis.  I would like to understand the need for such a complicated and lengthy process to develop an item that it doesn't seem to be that complex.  I recall that when I contacted you years back, I indicated that I had heard of concerns about the system, but that I didn't have a personal experience.  You assured me that it was not the case.  After encountering initial difficulties, I thought it had to do with the problems associated with the VRS system, and then the transition to USF.   I am very sorry to have learn from direct experience that the system is not working.  I understand that USF is seeking federal funds for a Rehab. Institute.   How viable is that goal, when a program can't even handle individual small project?

 

I will greatly appreciate an update on the status of the spin art machine.

 

Can you please supply me once more with the name of the vendor that represents the standing wheelchair that Lucy was assessed for?

Eileen and Anibal are the proud parents of a Youth Hall of Fame Winner.  

Last night, Laura - our 8th grader at Epiphany Catholic Middle School - was inducted into the Walter B. Arnold Dade County Youth Hall of Fame.  The competition is against one student from each of the 120 middle schools in Dade County (public or private). The award is based on leadership, academics, and outstanding service to both your school and community. (the sale of the girl scout cookies for the benefit of Operation Smile was one of those service projects that helped to make her win - so thank you!)

Laura first won the Division 5 section of the competition (there were 6 divisions in all - for both middle school and high school) For that win, she received a plaque and a $100 savings bond.  Then for being picked the top middle school student last night, she also won a crystal-type trophy, $1000, and a permanent display with her name and school at the youth Hall of Fame located inside the exhibit hall of the Dade County Youth Fair.  This is only the 3rd year of the contest, so her trophy will be displayed with the 4 previous winners (two from middle school and two from high school for years 2001 and 2002)

 <http://www.sun-sentinel.com/technology/ats-ap_technology14mar26,0,3622049.story?coll=sns%2Dtechnology%2Dheadlines> Missouri Lawmaker Creates Virtual Office
(Wednesday, 03/26/2003 © Ft. Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel) 

    	JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- Stepping into state Rep. Rob Schaaf's office in the stately old Missouri Capitol is like crossing a threshold into the future. 


There's no secretary, no filing cabinet. Business cards and meeting notices are promptly scanned into a computer. Visitors sit in front of a digital camera and leave messages on video disc. 


In a building that generates thousands of pounds of documents weekly, Schaaf and his office are virtually paperless. During lengthy debate on the floor or in scattered hearing rooms, Schaaf can get work done electronically. 


"My goal is to be a pioneer," Schaaf said. 


He even puts tech-savvy California lawmakers to shame. 


"I've never heard of anything so far-reaching as what this particular lawmaker is doing, trying to eliminate paper from his office and his life," said Evan Goldberg, chief of staff to California Sen. Debra Bowen, herself a technologically progressive lawmaker. 


Schaaf's legislative assistant, Ray Griggs, scans documents delivered to the office and places them in separate computer folders. 


"When Rob gets back here late at night he can sit there and watch these lobbyists and constituents talk about their problems, and he can turn around and call them back at his own leisure," Griggs said. 


Wherever he may be, Schaaf checks messages, committee schedules and those scanned documents by tapping his personal digital assistant, which he hooks up to a laptop in his office now and then to get new files. 


Schaaf, a 46-year-old freshman Republican, created his virtual office with his own high-powered computer, Griggs' video technology and some equipment provided by the state. 


His office is sparse. He has a pair of desks where the computers sit and two chairs for digital recording sessions. A television rests on a shelf for Schaaf to watch recordings. Nearby is a stack of jewel cases containing video discs. 


Schaaf believes the arrangement lets him sift through information quickly. 


"There is too much work to do and get it all done, so we had to figure out a way to be more efficient, and we are more efficient this way," Schaaf said. "And I think this brings me closer to people because they have greater access to me." 


Besides hearing directly from constituents on video disc, Schaff can send them recordings of himself. 


The Missouri Legislature has grappled for years with technology. 


Members of the Missouri House have been allowed to use personal laptop computers in the chamber since 1997. But the tradition-conscious Senate has repeatedly rejected the idea -- even though live debate of both chambers is available over the Internet. 


Many lawmakers prefer to have paper in hand to conduct business -- even if that makes their offices cramped. 


Pam Greenberg, who follows technology issues for the National Conference of State Legislatures, said more state lawmakers are embracing technology such as the personal digital assistant. 


In some states, like Texas and South Carolina, lawmakers can download updates on committee hearings right into their PDA, Greenberg said. 


Schaaf's approach is partly attributable to assistant Griggs, who runs a video production company and created several of Schaaf's campaign advertisements using computer graphics. 


Schaff's predecessor, state Sen. Charlie Shields, was impressed by the setup. 


"It's an interesting way to do things," said Shields, who is leading efforts to allow laptops in the Senate. "I'm not sure if it's going to work. We'll have to see." 


Schaaf, who had not previously held elective office, said Missouri lawmakers should embrace technology to better serve the public. 


"My colleagues will realize that they waste a tremendous amount of time, that they waste a tremendous amount of paper and that there will be a great cost saving by doing things digitally," Schaaf said. 


"The law will be digital, all of the bills will be digital, instead of all this volume of paper. It's just going to take many years."

Subject: You asked me to email you today about my son...


Hello Governor Bush,
I met you at MacDill today, you saw the picture of my son, Sam, who is the
Blackhawk pilot. You asked for his email address.  I want to thank you for
your concern...which I could see was genuine.

We are a "Bush" family from way back....in 1991, when we were stationed in
Panama during the first Gulf War, your father and mother came to Albrook
Airforce Base for a visit. We lived next door on Ft. Clayton. The military
police warned families not to try to come to Albrook because of anti-war
violence in Panama. But, my son Sam, (who is now the pilot) was at the time
about 12 years old, said, "Mom, how often does a kid get to see a
President?"  So I put both him and mydaughter in the car, we ducked down
and drove from the back gate of Clayton to the back gate of Albrook to see
your dad and  mom.   We were a small group that day,....but Sam got to
shake your dad's hand.  I find it ironic that 12 years later he is serving
under your brother.  He is proud of what he does....and we are so proud of
the steadfastness of your family.

Thank you again for your concern,  Sam (and Amanda, his wife)'s email
address is:  mandap23@yahoo.com

PS. Sam is still in Germany, but should be going to  Turkey any day.  His
copter and humvee left about 5 weeks ago and he and the rest of his unit
were put on hold due to the lack of a "approved" landing area.  He is
anxious to get to work for the sake of freedom.  I expect he may be leaving
ina few days or may be gone now.

Blessings,
Joyce Pemberton

Subject:	Sugar Industry's Legislative Amendments to Everglades Forever Act

Jeb:

I just met with Denver and David, plus lobbyists for Fanjul and U.S. Sugar
Interests to discuss the industry's proposed amendments to the Everglades
Forever Act. These amendments would essentially "trump" the process going
on in front of the ERC. They would make the 10ppb standard meaningless, and
substitute a "planning objective" in the range of 15ppb. Further, the
amendment language we saw would limit the possible phosphorus remedies to
only "optimizaton" of the existing Stormwater Treatment Areas until the
legislature AGAIN amends the Everglades Forever Act sometime (unknown) in
the future. All of the possibilities to pursue periphyton STA
modifications, and expansion of the STAs, and the other more advanced
technologies would be legislatively precluded until after 2026, or until
the Legislature acts again.

We have been working hard to reach a reasonable conclusion to the
rulemaking process at the ERC; the sugar industry senses that the staff
recommendations of DEP may prevail at the ERC, and they want to make a
legislative "end run". I sense that David is being heavily pressured on
this by sugar lobbyists, who now include David Rancourt and John Thrasher,
who appear to have shown up to help U.S. Sugar. 

I hope you will continue to support David's original plan to address the
Everglades Phosphorus issue through appropriate rulemaking, and NOT give
support to ANY plan to open up the Everglades Forever Act in the
Legislature.

Charles

Subject:	Autism insurance bill 169

Dear Govenor Busch,
I am a speech language pathologist who speacializes in
treating children with autism.  In 2001, Stone & Yoder
published a study in the the journal "Autism" (vol 5,
issue 4, pages 341-361) finding that the number of
hours in speech therapy was a significant predictor
(one of only 2 predictors found) for later speech
development in children with autism. I have
personnally had the pleasure of seeing children with
autism and their families benefit immensly from speech
therapy, many of whom feel that their child has
recovered from autism and is no longer autistic.

I am writing to encourage you to support bill 169, and
not postpone its approval.  Thank you for your time. 

Sincerely, Rene Wazowicz, MS CCC-SLP

Sorry to cut you two off but I really am under the gun on several deadlines
and thought perhaps we had hit on all the core points enough.

I will review my notes but think I provided you with most of the substantive
conclusions our team made.

Between this and next week I have a very full schedule.  If I find

if you have any questions about specific things you'd like to know if the

Subject:	Medicaid Task Force Progress!

Governor----We made progress tonight!!  We feel much better.

The Task Force Governors’ staff compiled a list of the top 5 Medicaid Challenges.  Of course everyone had various views.  We developed 6 general categories.  We then assigned an R and D state to develop a presentation of the issue, problems, and suggested options/recommendations for solution.  Financing, the most difficult issue, is off the table for the moment.  (This is what we wanted all along otherwise we won’t move forward.)  We can now focus on the substantive reform issues.  The following identifies the state and issues that will be discussed in our next staff meetings on Friday, March 28 (10a.m. to 12noon), and Tuesday, April 1 (4 to 6 p.m.).

Dual Eligibles		 		ND	IN	Friday, 3/28

Flexibility/Federal Mandates (including
   benefits/co-pays & administration)	FL	KY	Tuesday, 4/1

Prescription Drugs			IA	MD	Friday, 3/28

Private Sector coordination		CT	NM	Friday, 3/28

Long Term Care				ID	MO	Tuesday, 4/1

Financing				no assignment


The next Governors’ conference call is scheduled Wed, April 2 at 3:30 p.m.  (Tara, we really need the Gov on the call).  On this call, we will present the Governors w/ all agreed upon issues.  We will also leave for their discussion and decision those issues where staff cannot agree.

Bob Sharpe and Rhonda should be on our staff calls on Friday and Tues (3/28 and 4/1) in addition to the Gov’s call on Wed. 4/2. 

More later….Nina

Subject:	Medicaid Task Force--new fiscal idea

Governor,   There’s a new thought in the works and if we think it through and we are comfortable w proceeding…the Governor’s Task Force meeting, here in DC, on April 10th will be critical.

Finance Committee Chairman Grassley is considering a mark-up beginning the week of April 7 on the Tax Bill.  Senator Grassley has consistently been favorable to some sort of fiscal relief to states (primarily FMAP).  We understand that he is considering adding a state fiscal relief provision in the mark-up.  (Last week the Senate passed a Sense of the Senate Resolution supporting fiscal relief for states…the provision passed with 80+ votes.)

Realistically…neither the House nor the Administration will agree to FMAP.

Ray Scheppach came to see me tonight w/ a decent proposal.  He agrees that FMAP will go no where, no matter how much push.  Alternatively, he has suggested that we work to “convert” the dollars that Grassley might have in mind, to a transitional prescription drug benefit, particularly for dual eligibles.  This may be more acceptable to the House and the Administration, although OMB will not care for it; and it might create some heartburn for the Administration because it would curtail some of the tax relief.  Also, there are 4 D states on the task force that are adamant about FMAP.  (Having Vilsack (D-IA) work w/ Chairman Grassley (R-IA) could help us w/ the D’s on the task force.)

We don’t have paper…but we feel that this is something we can work with…ONLY if in report or statutory language we include a provision requiring Medicaid reform w/in the window of the transition drug benefit.

We discussed w/ Kathleen tonight.  She can give you her views but, if we can support this idea by tomorrow…Karen and I will work w/ NGA to move it along as we continue to move on the Medicaid Task Force.  If we support, the Task Force Meeting on the 10th will be timely since we believe mark-up could occur that week and Hill meetings w/ Congressional Leadership will be crucial.  

Nina.

Jeb, this is from Warren Hoskins, Clerk of Miami Friends Meeting. -- John W.
_ _ _ _ _ _ _

Dear John, 

I leave it to you whether this goes to the CERJ list or if there are other places you might make it known, but I am saddened, and more ashamed of the violence of my state than ever before.

We learned about this by e-mail from <kimotalks@aol.com> to Florida Friends for Peace <FloridaFriendsForPeace@yahoogroups.com>, which was forwarded from that group to a list that I get.  I don't know who "kimotalks" is, but I am copying "kimotalks" with this e-mail.  Lake Worth, Florida, is a town on the south side of West Palm Beach, and has problems of violence.  A couple of years ago, 13 year old 7th grade student Nathaniel Brazill, shot and killed one of his teachers, Barry Grunow, at Lake Worth Middle School--just a few blocks from the Palm Beach Friends Meeting. 

I found no article, editorial or follow up in the rest of the on-line newspaper, just the notice pasted below in this e-mail.

This is what "kimotalks" posted:

Hi folks...I just learned that a Lake Worth bar manager was shot dead Sunday night after a heated argument over the invasion of Iraq, i.e., a local casualty of war mongering.  The news story was posted in the Palm Beach Post on Tuesday but is not available on line at this time and no other newpapers have picked up the story. 

Apparently John Komyakevich, while working at R&V Liquors and Lounge, got into a passionate argument over the treatment of POWs with a 61-year old customer who stormed out of the bar and then returned with a gun.  The customer shot seven times, with 5 bullets hitting Komyakevich.

Komyakevich was a Russian immigrant, and a friend who talked to a Palm Beach Post reporter says he was a pacifist.  I will post more information as I get it but if anyone would like to attend the funeral services, the information is below:

[The following is the notice from the on-line Palm Beach Post, which I had to hunt for--not easily available online at all.  The search link is off the obituary page. Main search was not working, there was no headline in the previous days' on-line editions, nor was it mentioned in their neighborhood "war stories" where the staff write about how teachers are teaching the war, and what people are saying at the VFW in the area (musing about using fire hoses on protestors, according to that article).  I telephoned a number for the bar and the number for the funeral home in the article and verified that yes, he was murdered, and that the visitation will be Thursday evening as scheduled. Amazingly, I see nothing on the news about the person who committed this murder. --Warren]

JOHN KOMYAKEVICH   Age 33, of Palm Beach Shores, became a casualty of the war here on the home front. His negative opinion of the war tragically cost him his life. John was a lifelong soccer player, born in Magadon, Russia, who came to the U.S. twelve years ago with a Russian football team to compete in soccer. Two years later, he came to New Hampshire and then eventually moved to West Palm Beach. He was a very happy, outgoing and kind man, who we will all miss dearly. He is survived by family and friends in the U.S. and Russia. Visitation will be at Thomas L. Price Funeral Home on Thursday, March 27, 2003 from 6 PM to 2 AM. A funeral service will also be held Thursday evening. Thomas L. Price Funeral Home 553 Northlake Boulevard North Palm Beach, FL 33408 (561) 842-1555 www.dignitymemorialpalmbeach.com [the site is an ad -- nothing about John Komyakevich at that web site]

I cannot help but ask, if a passionately anti-Iraq war person had committed this act, would the papers and the television stations have been so deadly silent?  And this was not a man unknown in his community, either.

Subject: Mr. Lowe


Good Morning Governor Bush, Mr. Christ, Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Bronson

I would like to discuss with you the above referenced persons' appeal to reinstate his rights. Mr. Lowe was indicted twice in the 80's for drug smuggling including once with corrupt custom agents in Naples, Florida. He at 63 has just recently(1998) in the past few years gotten off probation for the last incident. He was arrested at that time  for transporting 49,000+ kilos of Cocaine and 19,000+ tons of marijuana over a 10 year period as head pilot  for a CARTEL named "THE ENTERPRISE" . Mr. Lowe went through our community telling everybody that he was framed and setup and that he is now a born again Christian. Well, Mr. Bush, I for one do not think it is possible to be framed or setup when you perform criminal activity for approximately 20 years and especially when you have been arrested two times previously for the same kind of crime along with corrupt government custom agents. Mr. Lowe was arrested the last time with 9 other men involved in this cartel and was the only one convicted of all charges. 

Governor Bush, I have talked to many people about this and they have stated as I do that this criminal is not entitled to have his rights reinstated as he was not just a corner street dealer but a smuggler for 10 years that has supplied the drugs that have killed or caused addictions to many peoples husbands, brothers, daughters, sons, mothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces or cousins. I for one have lost a brother at 41 and my daughter is a recovering drug addict who had done drugs from 9 to 16.  I know you can relate to this as well. The sad part of this entire thing is that all we can do is pray that our children make it through this and we don't have to bury our own children before ourselves. I for one can not even begin to know what it is like to have to bury my child because some Criminal like Lowe supplied drugs to my child that killed them. I hope neither you or I have to go through that kind of experience as I have lost a lot of childhood friends to alcoholism and drugs and just recently lost my adopted brother/lawyer to murder because of a drug addict. As far as being a born again Christian, I am sure this is possible but I also believe that a Leopard never changes his spots and 99% of the time that has been proven. I think of my brother everyday and how much he missed in this lifetime, all for another hit on a joint or another snort of cocaine and all because some drug smuggler brought drugs into this country that were treated with cancer causing chemicals that have been banned in this country. 

Governor Bush, I hope you will think twice before reinstating this mans rights as it could be yours or my husband, father, son, mother, sister, daughter, nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles or cousins that are killed next because some drug smuggler/born again Christian brought drugs into our country.

Attn:  Raquel Rodriguez, Esquire

Dear Ms. Rodriguez,

I am writing to recommend to you and Governor Bush the appointment of
Clay Simmons as  Seminole County Circuit Judge.  I have known Clay for
over 20 years.  His children and mine have grown up together.  He's been
active in his church and community with Boy Scouts, Seminole soccer,
Lake Mary High School Band, etc.  He has been a dedicated family man and
father as well as a good friend.  I consider him to be honorable,
honest, hard working and sincere.   I believe he would make an excellent
judge.  He's always calm and thoughtful when dealing with others.

As Chairman of the City of Lake Mary Planning and Zoning Board, I have
worked close with Clay and his staff on legal issues regarding the city
and my board.  He has always worked hard to find equitable solutions to
a wide variety of city and planning issues over the years that he and
his firm have represented the City of Lake Mary.

While I would miss his excellent representation in matters coming before
the city and my board, I feel strongly that you would be wise to select
him as the next Seminole County Circuit Judge.

I appreciate your time and your strong consideration of Mr. Simmons in
your deliberation to find a suitable judge for Seminole County.

Thank you and sincerely,

Hopefully, someone has brought to your attention the following news article:

 I attended your Destination Florida Commission meeting in Orlando last year and  understand one of your goals   was to entice more retirees to Florida.   
 
If that is the case, we need more protection for the home buyers.  This case is an abomination.  People have sold their homes  and are awaiting closing.  My brother and sister-in-law are presently in a rental, having sold their prior condo, and were expected to close in April.  The building is complete, down to appliances.  How can this be allowed?  Tear down an outstanding, upscale community!  What kind of message will this be sending to retirees contemplating a move to the State of Florida.  
 
For myself, all I can say is that we didn't retire to have major problems like this thrust upon us -- not knowing how long, if ever, the situation would be resolved, and  at what cost .  We don't need this kind of anguish in our retirement years!
 
We need help.

Subject:	help for the children

I am always hearing the speech of "NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND".  However, in the state of Florida, it really means no normal child left behind.  Due to very limited budgets and poor management, my autistic son has been on the Medicaid Waiver waiting list for over a year.  He has not received ANY of the services he is entitled to because there is no funding.  Early invention and therapy is one of the main treatments for Autistic children  they respond  better the younger they receive treatment.  Autism is a not a physically ugly disease.  it is not hard to look upon these little angels, as most of them are peaceful little souls.  However, they struggle with every task that is put before them.  Most insurance companies do not recognize AUTISM and related disorders as a disease and therefore do not cover much needed therapy.  If they cover anything, it is usually very limited and has a max on the amount of visits a child can have per year.
 
It is imperative that you do everything you can to support BILL 169 that will make insurance companies responsible for the coverage the state of Florida is not capable of providing.  
 
My child needs your voice and support.  Please do not let us down.
 
Please feel free to contact me.
 
sincerely,
Mrs. Allison Velarde

Dear Jeb, 
    First, congratulations on the great job that you are doing as Governor. To briefly catch up, as you might remember I was a prosecutor in Palm Beach. Now working as a prosecutor in Broward. Hey, it's honest important work and some real good things can be done for the public and for crime victims. 
      Jeb, I'm writing you on behalf of Alan Sackrin, one of twelve names recently sent to you by the Judicial Nominating Commission for you to select two Circuit Court Judges in Dade. 
    Alan attended Univ of Miami Law School with me and has been my best friend and like a brother to me for 24 years. Alan has great character, is extremely ethical, has great respect for the law and would make a fine judge.Alan has been a Board Certified civil trial attorney for the past 12 years and has great trial and appellate experience. He is great academically having graduated near the top of his class at U of M Law. He is very highly regarded by his peers and by many judges. Philosophically, Alan believes that a judges role is to follow the law as written by the legislature and not legislate from the bench. 
    Jeb, this is not a pro forma letter but a 100% endorsement for my very best friend. Alan is married to his wonderful wife
Cindy, a respected family lawyer, and has two children, 11and 14 who attend public school in North Dade.  Jeb, thanks for your consideration. I look forward to seeing you on the Republican campaign trail and you can count on my support for any future endeavors. I can be reached on my mobile at 561-702-4067. With my warmest personal regards, Andy Newman

Subject:	Please don't give up on our kids!

March 27, 2003

The Honorable Jeb Bush
Governor
Tallahassee, FL
Jeb@jeb.org

Dear Governor Bush,  
   
I know these are tough economic times and it is critical to tighten the belt, but please don't give up on our kids!  Your decision to eliminate funding for the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission's youth camps and their public education programs appears inconsistent with your strong stand on youth education and conservation of Florida's natural resources.  It is critical that these programs, proposed for elimination in your budget, are funded.  I invite you to come see the camps in operation this summer before you make your final decision that they are not worth tax payers investment.

These camps teach our youth about Florida's land and waters with information on topics such as conservation, wildlife, hunter safety, archery and fishing.  They teach safe and appropriate use of rifles, shotguns and archery equipment.  They are not teaching self defense or combat tactics. They teach responsible wildlife management strategies, including hunting, a more critical concern as we face tremendous growth resulting in loss and fragmentation of wildlife habitat. You can find more information about the summer camp program on the updated website at http://floridaconservation.org/hunting/camp/

   I am a statewide member of the Board of Directors for the Friends of the Ocala Youth Camp/Friends of Youth Conservation Camp (FOYC/FYCC), representing citizens throughout Florida and around the country who have benefited from and continue to support the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission's Youth Camp programs since they were organized over 50 years ago. The FOYC/FYCC is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to supporting the conservation education and outdoor recreational programs of the Ocala Youth Camp located at the Hunter Education Training Center on Lake Eaton in the Ocala National Forest.

          I am a product of the FWCC summer camp program. More than 45,000 youth have participated at the Ocala Youth Camp since it was founded 50 years ago.  There are literally thousands of Florida citizens who have personally benefited from programs offered at the Commission camps and who know well the long term values and benefits of education that extend beyond the parameters of fiscal operations. The programs have trained responsible outdoorsmen, environmental attorneys, Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission biologists, law enforcement officers, water management district staff, youth program workers, writers, museum directors and teachers that are continuing to share and communicate the Commission's stewardship message. 

     We understand that government funding is growing increasingly more restricted with the current unpredictable economic times. We know that hard decisions must be made, but we urge you to continue funding these programs.  Past efforts at privatizing the Ocala Youth Camp compromised the program and it has yet to fully recover. Since the re-establishment of the summer camp program two years ago with a new identity, the program is just now beginning to flourish.  

     We would greatly appreciate the opportunity to meet with you to discuss a strategy for long-term support of the summer camp program.  We are committed to working with the Commission in identifying outside funding sources, but we feel that your proposal to not fund the Camp Director position or an adequate operating budget next year jeopardizes our ability to assist in finding adequate funding alternatives.

     We urge your continued funding in support of the facilities, summer camps and associated educational activities, all important programs that have and will continue to impact the lives of thousands of Florida citizens.  

    I look forward to hearing from you or your staff soon to arrange an appointment for you to visit the Ocala Youth Camp this summer.   Feel free to call me on my cell at 407-908-4379.

Honorable Senator Atwater:
 
I am a resident of Broward County, and a parent of a young lady with significant disabilities that attend Cooper City HS.  We currently have a scheduled due process hearing on the issue Lucy;s denial of Free and Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) as it relates to her transition services under IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act).  
 
I will be calling you, to personally share with you about our personal experience, so that you understand why you must pull your proposed SB 2676.  I belive that Representative Seiler is pulling his bill from the House.  Please read e-mail below to Broward County School Board members on the issue.  I am also copying Governor Jeb Bush so that he is aware of what is going on.  He does understands what I am talking about.
 
I trust that you will do what is right to the people, which is to protect the educational rights of students with disabilities, and not allow the school board attorneys to oppressed us.  Thank you very much for your support.
 
Respecfully,

Subject: ESE Procedural Safeguards
 

Dear Broward County School board members:

 

My daughter Luz Elena Aponte is an ESE student at Cooper City HS, district 2.

 

The Broward County Public Schools 2003 Legislative Program listed the following:

*	Authorizing the school board to exercise discovery procedures in due process hearings involving students with disabilities. 

*	Placing a statutory limitation on the time period in which a parent/guardian of an exceptional education student has the right to file a due process petition seeking reimbursement for costs associated with placing the students in a private school when the placement was a unilateral decision of the parent/guardian.

Were those issues presented and supported by the Broward County Parent ESE Advisory Board?  Did the parents endorsed the above legislative issues?  I hope that as elected officials you seek the advise of the constituents that you represent that will be directed affected by your legislative agenda.
 
Since in the past you have been misinformed on educational issues related to educational rights of students with disabilities, as it was the case of the Extended School Year (ESY) services a few years ago, I like to think that is the reason for which you have endorsed the above legislative issues.  It's obvious that those issues have triggered current proposed bills before the Florida legislation on ESE procedural safeguards which are intended to undo our present system.  Please understand that HB 975 & SB 2676 proposes to changes the Florida Statutes by making the ESE due process hearings exempt from the formalities of a hearing.  

 

That is contradictory and in violation of IDEA.  IDEA clearly states that States must have a system of due process that is fair and impartial. Current Florida law exempt ESE due process hearings from the "formalities" of the Model Rules and other hearing "formalities," including discovery.   Even with the current statute and case law on our side, and because most parents are not aware, and do not exercise their right under the law, Administrative Law Judges rarely follow the informality required in these cases and continue to treat ESE due process hearing cases as "formal" hearings.  Since more parents in Broward county, including ourselves are exercise our rights, the school board attorney’s in retaliation and in an attempt to oppressed us are now trying to change the current protection to those of us that seek the due process remedy when our sons/daughters are being denied a Free and Appropriate Public Education (FAPE).  

 

We elected you to represent our interest.  I trust that as you did in the case of the ESY, that you realized that student’s rights are being denied.  Please retract from your position and  represent the needs and interest of those that elected you.

 

Respecfully,

 

Berthy De La Rosa-Aponte

Subject:	Re: Developmental Disabilities issues



Dear Berthy and all,
Sorry for my delayed response, my life has been very busy these past few 
weeks.

Regarding the legislative update you refer to:  Please understand that this 
report is specifically prepared for and targeted to the Autism community, 
for their newsletter and for persons, providers and affiliated 
professionals.

Keep in mind that I also advocate for ESE, foster care and financially 
disadvantaged as well, all with different priorities and reports. Different 
populations have very different needs and as we have seen, it occurs within 
the DD population as well.  Yes, we all have the same ultimate goals and 
dreams, but many times the road we must take is different.  Focus on 
consumer choice is a frequent topic at the redesign meetings.  However, I 
will continue to advocate that what is best for the entire population should 
not be done at the expense of the most severe.  Sometimes you just can’t fit 
a ‘square peg into a round hole’.

Regarding your reference to third part evaluators (Maximus)
Many have been adversely affected because of these so called “prior service 
authorizations”.  What is this PSA nonsense?  Let’s call it what it really 
is:  a reduction or termination of services.  Waiver support coordinators 
should not have to be creative writers or more convincing than the recipient 
they work for.  They see the child regularly, know the needs of that child 
and family and are paid to make those determinations and for their services. 
Why are we paying for someone to randomly override these determinations?  
How can a company like Maximus, who has never seen a child, does not know 
the current physical, mental, or behavioral status of that child, or the 
family situation, make a random determination to reduce or terminate 
services??  This is not checks and balances, it more like check-kiting. They 
are doing it to reduce costs.  I have seen it happen to many families of 
children with autism and in fact it has happened to me.

In December of last year we moved. Little did I know what a devastating 
effect this would have on my autistic daughter!  She has all the classic 
symptoms including the obsessive-compulsive predictable routine needs, and 
the self-injurious behaviors.  Even though we thoroughly prepared her for 
the move, making many visits back and forth, doing pictures of old house/new 
house and even putting the same wallpaper in her new room, (not an easy 
find).   In spite of our enormous efforts, Stephanie had a complete 
meltdown.  Biting her hands until she bled, punching herself with both fists 
in her eyes, and banging her head, putting it through the walls in her room, 
the bathroom and her bedroom window.  She was going to the Dan Marino Center 
for care at least once a week, changing multitudes of medications to calm 
her.  At one point she was on 7 medications per day, still nothing helped as 
children with autism build a tolerance to medications very quickly.
My only relief was when she was in school, but that also changed as 
Stephanie would get out of her seat on the bus (which she never did in 7 
years) and pull the bus driver’s hair because she was going the wrong way.  
During school she needed 4 staff people for extended periods of time to stop 
her from hurting herself and they ultimately requested we take her to the 
psyche ward at Joe DiMaggio’s Children’s hospital for chemical restraints as 
opposed to physically restraining her.  At the hospital, the emergency room 
doctor saw her bruises and admitted her under the “Baker Act”, as she was 
very aggressive, and could not stop hurting herself and others who tried to 
stop her.  To make matters worse, that week on my way to the hospital to be 
with her I was rear ended at a red light by a woman going 45 mph and ended 
up in the hospital as well. My car has over $12,000 in damages, and I have 
tremendous pain and lost feeling in two toes and one finger. I am now unable 
to effectively care for my daughter or even bath her.

HERE’S THE ICING ON THE CAKE…The following week I received a notice from 
Maximus that Stephanie’s PCA services were being reduced. Now, when I needed 
them more than ever.  My support coordinator is very good and explained the 
situation, but I must still go through the “reconsideration and appeals 
process”.

Stephanie was on the waiting list for services over 8 years.  This past year 
was the first time we finally received help.  During the 8 years on the 
waiting list we spent over $50,000 per year on Stephie’s care.  As a result, 
we have exhausted most of our savings and have moved into a smaller home. 
Her support plan was approved at less than $35,000 and I was thankful to get 
that.  Now it has been cut to less than $15,000.   My husband says that he 
cannot continue to live like this and has given me an ultimatum.  I cannot 
bring myself to institutionalize a non-verbal child that cannot tell me if 
she is hurt or abused.  If Stephanie were in an ICF it would cost the State 
well in excess of $150,000 for her care.  I ask you again, how is this 
checks and balances?  The state is throwing away money that can be used for 
services to those in need and on the waiting list.

I could go on but I am sure you get the point.

As far as the wait list, I still can’t see your frequent reference and 
connection to providers being responsible for this solution.  Sadly, not all 
persons can be rehabilitated; some do and will need permanent, intensive 
care.  Which brings me to the tiered rate issue.  The redesign team may be 
addressing it but it was not addressed in the Mercer report to the Senate 
Committee on Children and Families when Mercer made their presentation of 
the rate study.  In my opinion it was an embarrassment to the redesign 
effort.

Mercer could not answer the questions regarding autism and when we talk 
about rate compression this is the population that will be affected. Autism 
is the most expensive population to care for, because they are not in wheel 
chairs, are physically very strong and behaviorally erratic, in addition to 
the fact that most cannot communicate effectively.
Basically Mercer summarized their study by saying ‘you get what you pay 
for’.  I, along with many of the Legislators do not feel that we got what we 
paid for.  Those with more intense needs should not suffer because there is 
no ‘cost of living increase’ factored into aged contracts that the 
Department refuses to renegotiate.

Additionally, thank you for mentioning Florida ARF.  I am honored to be the 
new parent representative on the Florida ARF Board, (Advocating for 
Rehabilitation’s Future) as well as a member of the board of the Autism 
Society, YMCA, FJGC, and others that give me an opportunity to see the big 
picture and provide objective input from both a parental and administrative 
perspective.

I will continue to work for the benefit of all people with developmental 
disabilities and will continue to be vigilant of the most severe populations 
that will without question need the programs that so few providers are 
willing to continue to risk implementing.

Hi Susan:

Several people forwarded your attached legislative updated on 2003
Developmental Disabilities issues.  As a parent myself of a young lady with
significant cognitive, physical, behavioral, and health issues, I am always
grateful for parents that like you advocate not just for their kids but for
others. As a member of the Developmental Disabilities Redesign team, I 
hereby
respectfully make a few comments to the information that you shared with
others.

*   Third party evaluators (Maximus) - It is my understanding that some
recipients services have been adversely affected because the written "prior
service authorizations" (PSA) are not necessarily reflecting all the needs 
of
the individuals, or it's not clear as to how the PSA should be written.  We
need to make sure that all Waiver Supports Coordinators (third party
advocates) know how the PSA needs to be written, and understand the
importance that an accurate and convincing PSA is presented on behalf of the
recipient that they work for.  Having GOOD independent third party 
evaluators
and advocates (WSC) can provide the system and our sons and daughters with
checks and balances.  Let's ask the state to have this issue addressed as a
Redesign issue.

*   Wait List time -   People shouldn't wait years to receive services.  In
addition to the needed additional funds to address this situation, another
fair remedy is by making sure that ALL providers are accountable for what
they are contracted to provide.  Adult day training programs (ADT), and
residential habilitation (Res. hab) services (which account to 50% of the
Waiver budget) should, for many recipients be of transitional nature, and 
not
permanent as they mostly are.  If recipients are trained and habilitated, as
contracted, to move from ADT and res. hab. to more independent services, it
will clear some services and funding for some on the wait list.  It is my
understanding that you are a board member of the Florida Association of
Rehabilitation Facilities (FARF), and staff of ARC Broward.  If that is the
case, you are in an ideal situation to influence the providers in that area.
I have repeatedly requested statistical information as to the percentage of
recipients being trained (ADT) and habilitated (res. hab), but have never
received answer.  Do you have that information?

*   Tiered rate system - As you know, this is being addressed by the 
Redesign
team.  We have made progress on that area.  It is my understanding that the
level of disability will be reflected on the rates, not only for recipients
that have challenging behaviors like your daughter and mine, but also for
those that have lifting, incontinence and other challenging issues.  We need
to continue to make sure that our input is reflected, and be vigilant so 
that
those that live at home (who are the majority of the 25,000 on the waiver,
and the 10,000 on the wait list) are not adversely affected by the rate
structure, or by having lower rates to independent in-home and community
providers.

Again, let's work together (self advocates, parents, providers, legislators,
state) for the benefit of all people with developmental disabilities
regardless of the disability label (CP, spina bifida, MR, autism, pradi
willi), or whether or not they are on the wait list or receiving services.

Legislative Update from Susan Goldstein

Our Autism Insurance Bill, House Bill 169, is up in the first House 
Committee
next week!!
Wednesday, March 26th at 1:00 p.m. in Morris Hall.
Lets make a strong showing and sign up to speak in favor of the bill!
The House Care Subcommittee on Health Services
Members include: (Republicans)
Garcia, Chair, Murzin, V-Chair, Benson, Homan, Poppell, Prieguez, Robaina,
(Democrats) Bucher, Cusak, Joyner, Roberson
Please contact them and ask them to vote in favor of the bill.

Go to www.autismfl.com and click on the new website, post contact 
information
all websites!!
Attached is a sheet with talk points


Another important issue is funding of Developmental Services for Med Waiver
Call speaker Byrd and Governor Bush and convey the following messages:

Adequately Fund Developmental Services for the Disabled
Please protect and help our most vulnerable citizens
"   Fully annualize program funding for services to the developmentally
disabled.

"   Terminate the excessive contracts ($10 million plus) with third party
evaluators who reduce and terminate services randomly, without regard to 
need
and without seeing the children or families.

"   Provide services before families reach the crisis point.  Foster care
children with disabilities are very difficult to place.

"   Limit the amount of time the disabled must wait for services and ensure
there is a plan to address the waiting list of 10,500 persons.

"   Fund the existing deficit in DCF/Developmental Services; do not carry it
forward for yet another year.

"   Enact funding escalation provisions to keep pace with prevalence
increases.  Funding for developmentally disabilities increased 94% in the
past 4 years versus a 600% increase in the disabled population.

"   Institute a tiered rate system for programs and services to difficult
populations and individuals that are more aggressive, self-injurious and
behaviorally involved, i.e. autism.

"   Resolve and limit outlandish workers compensation premiums for providers
of services to the most difficult developmentally disabled populations.


Please read the following and write your editorial boards in your newspapers
and send copies to your legislators in your district.  This plea must come
from all over the State and it must be heard loud and strong within the
leadership of the House and the Governor's office.  The Senate is on board.
Write and thank Senator Jim King for his help and leadership.

Currently, services for the developmentally disabled are significantly
under-funded.  This situation in part is due to the fact that the incidence
of autism, the most expensive population to treat, has increased by 520% in
the last 5 years while funding for all disabilities has only increased 94%.

There are over 10,500 people currently on the waiting list for assistance;
many have been waiting more than 5 years.  In addition there is a $17 
million
deficit that has been carried over from last year that must be funded. The
system is doomed for failure because it is continually playing catch-up.

Speaker Byrd and the Governor have taken the position that we must live
within our means, just as a family would. Unfortunately, the current 
solution
for addressing the waiting list of those in need of assistance is 'robbing
Peter to pay Paul'.  Randomly reducing or terminating services to one
disabled person in order to provide services to another is akin to check
kiting. Eventually it will hit the fan. When it does, it ends up costing 
more
and becomes a safety issue.

You cannot justify taking crucial services from one disabled person to give
to another. It is like telling one child that they ate yesterday so their
brother gets to eat today.   Many who loose services request reconsideration
and must undergo an arduous appeals process.  This means the state costs
increase and the effort and legal expense the disabled family must endure
creates additional stress and hardship.   It's like the old 'or your money
back' deal.  I suppose they hope a large number will not appeal the cuts in
services.  No matter how you look at it, bottom line: it is impossible to
service more people with the same amount of money unless you take it from
those already receiving it.

Unfortunately, the longer children wait for intervention, the worse their
condition becomes.  The bigger and stronger the get, the more difficult they
are to care for.  For every $1 we spend before the age of 5, we save $7 on
lifelong care.  To neglect the needs of this population at a young age is
penny-wise and pound-foolish.

Speaker Byrd and the Governor want to stay within the budget and have
rejected recommendations to increase revenues through regulation of the 
video
gaming industry. The Senate agrees that a family should live within their
means.  However, if a family has a child that is in need of medical care 
they
find a way to provide it.  They get another job, mortgage their home, sell
off assets, increase credit, etc., they don't kite checks.

The Senate has a plan for a solution.  Florida already has gambling. We have
lottery, cruises to nowhere, Indian reservation gaming hotels, horseracing
and jaialai.  While hundreds of millions of dollars are being made, the 
state
is receiving absolutely no revenue for many of these activities.  If Speaker
Byrd and Governor Bush would agree to regulate this industry, many of the
crucial needs of developmental disabilities and other deserving populations
could be met.

Please call the Governor and Speaker Byrd and urge them to endorse the 
Senate
recommendations for regulation of the gaming industry and resolve the 
debacle
in DCF/Developmental Services.

Thank you Governor for your response.  Sorry to keep bothering you about this but I wanted to make one other point.  Keep in mind that this is Phase I of CAMS in a three phase project, one could logically contend that this $11M difference would be much higher over the course of the 3 phases, Covansys has also alleged in its protest of this award that Deloitte has left off certain core operational costs that were required by FDOR, in other words, we contend that the original $11M or almost 40% difference in our price could even be higher.  Thanks again for listening, and I relayed your original response on to our chairman and founder Raj Vattikuti.  Promise to leave you alone now.

Dear Governor Bush, I am hoping this matter has been brought to your
attention by a number of independent sources.  The Florida Department of
Revenue (FDOR) has awarded the child support system bid (called CAMS) to
Deloitte Consulting.  Covansys, which is a certified minority firm in
the State of Michigan and an affiliate member of the Florida Regional
Minority Business Council, was in a statistical tie with Deloitte in the
points evaluation, less than 1% separated the two firms.  The Covansys
bid was almost 40% lower in price, over $11M.  Covansys is one the
premier child support system vendors in the country and clearly should
have been awarded this work by FDOR, our solution is credible and our
experience and qualifications in this field are impeccable.  We hope
that someone in your administration will take up this matter and undo
this outrageous result.
Thank you for your attention to this matter,
Clint Weathers

Governor Bush,
 
I have just left an emergency meeting of the City Commissioners for the City of Deltona, Florida.  The topic was emergency measures to control stormwater.  
 
As you should be aware, Deltona, FL is experiencing wide spread flooding.  Our city, incorporated in December 1995, has seen it's infrastructure neglected by the developers and Volusia County for years.  Dozens of homeowners have been forced from their homes by the rising waters.  Hundreds more are within a foot of the same fate unless something is done IMMEDIATELY.  That something is the Lake Theresa Basin Overflow Project.
 
We were told all that is stopping the start of the Lake Theresa Basin Overflow Project is the Governor's declaration of an emergency situation.  Our mayor, John Masiarczyk, explained he had been in contact with a representative of your office this a.m., but as of 11:45 a.m. had not heard back.  How many homes and lives have to be disrupted before your office sees this as an emergency?  Your immediate action is required for the health and safety of our community.
 
 
Sincerely,

Dear Governor-

It has truly been an honor and a privledge to serve as one of your
appointees to the South Broward Hospital District. I appreciate the
confidence you have in me, and hope Iam serving you well.

Unfortunately, Iam going through a divorce and need to find a new permanent
home. I'd like to move east since the Israel Bonds office where I now work,
is located in Miami, my daily commute from Cooper City is over 1 hour each
way. Moving east, would take me out of my current sub- district#4 for the
South Broward  Hospital District.

As you know, Ray Montelone ( who is in the District's At- Large seat)
announced his resignation last night to accept an appointment  at the Board
of Education. I realize this is alot to ask, but i wondered if I could
transfer to Rays at-large seat and have the appointments office fill mine
instead. This would allow me to move closer to the Israel Bonds office and
continue serving on the District.

I love the District, Governor and have worked diligently for the betterment
of Broward County. I want very much to continue my service, as long as
you'll have me. It has been a very special honor. I will always be endebted
to you for the confidence you have placed in me , and the wonderful
opportunity to serve publically.
 
I look forward to your guidance.

Best Regards,

Commissioner
Laura Raybin Miller

As you probably know, Ray Monteleone resigned from the Board at last night's
monthly board meeting.  In an effort to communicate to you my thoughts on
this, I send you this e-mail.  

I would urge you to seek out an elder statesman to replace Ray.  I believe
that having served with Estelle Ernstoff my first 2 years on the board, she
brought a very important voice to the board.  With the everpresent elderly
community in South Broward, we are better poised to serve that community by
having a "community representative" on our board.   Hence, if the
opportunity is available, I would recommend the appontment of someone that
can bring that perspective to our board.  Thanks.  CJR

Subject: Bright (?) Futures


Dear Governor Bush:

This week in the Florida Times Union, there is an article stating that House
members are proposing a plan to level spending on the Bright Futures
program, and that college students could be forced to pick up the rising
cost of tuition starting this August - up to $120 if a 7.5% tuition increase
is implemented (Yes, 7.5%!).  My husband and I are amazed that tuition costs
could rise so drastically in one year, and appalled at the idea that our
legislature is considering changing Bright Futures requirements and
proceeds.  Bear with me, please, as I explain why.

We are the parents of a high school junior who has a 4.7 GPA and is 8th in
his class, while taking all honors and AP classes that are available to him.
The child has never made a "B".

This is a student who has worked extremely hard to keep up his outstanding
grades, while lettering in varsity sports every year since the 9th grade,
being chosen captain of many of those teams, volunteering weekly to teach
children's church, establishing and playing in a rock band, serving as class
officer, being an active member of BETA, Honor Society and FCA, and holding
down a part-time job.  This is a highly intelligent, motivated young leader
whose intent in this direction is to have 100% scholarship to a state school
so that he can make his own way after graduation.  He is currently
considering engineering as a possible major, with the hope of a life and
career in his Florida hometown.

My son is "part of the few, one of the best" as the scholar athlete slogan
goes, but he is certainly not alone in his situation.  There are many, many
kids who have worked as hard to keep up their grades and volunteerism in
their efforts to plan for college.  Not all of them will receive 100% Bright
Futures, but many will receive 75%.

Several years ago when talking with graduates about where they planned to go
to college, many of them would go to out of state or private schools for
various reasons.  In the recent past, since Bright Futures has been
available, the vast majority of those students will tell you that they are
going to one of the Florida state schools.  I'm sure this is costly to the
state school system, but at least our schools are getting the other revenues
(local fees, book fees, lab fees, dorm fees, food costs, etc.) from these
students, which might very likely be spent in other states.  Certainly the
advantage of having our own residents attend our own schools, and very
likely become the work force for our own state (and property owners who pay
taxes), has to be an extremely good thing for our state economy.

Our family is by no means able to provide financially for our son's college
education.  My husband is a plumber and I am a school secretary.  Our
daughter is a sophomore at UNF with plans to go to a 3 year chiropractic
college after she receives her Bachelors degree.  She is using her 75%
Bright Futures and a Florida Prepaid Scholarship which was awarded to her
through the Boselli Foundation.  Even the "full tuition Florida Prepaid"
only covers approximately 73% of tuition, as about 27% of the tuition fee is
comprised of "local fees"; whatever they are.

Surely you and all the Florida legislators know the importance of this
financial help, and don't need me to reiterate it to you.  I only hope you,
the "Education Governor", and our legislature will be able to regain control
of this situation and, at the very least, grandfather in a plan like this so
that parents and students alike can be aware of what they will need to do to
provide for their education.  To take it away midstream for current high
school students (juniors and seniors in particular), and for those currently
going to college under Bright Futures, is promising them something for years
and then saying, "Sorry, you worked for nothing.  We were only kidding!".
When other states, Georgia to name one, can provide free college education
for their residents, surely Florida can find a better way than drastically
changing this program.   How about eliminating the high-speed rail amendment
...?

Governor,
I was very disturbed by the passing in the Senate of SB460 in the Senate today.
Why have CON's in place to provide optimum health care for the citizens of Florida, when legislation will allow some areas to operate under one set of rules, while others follow another set. 
This is reminiscent of the damage done by the Constitutional amendments circumventing a process by which financial impacts and manageability of the outcomes must to be taken into consideration. In one case the public voted for something without the complete information and the other are legislators voting for something without truly understanding the final impact.
I"m sure you are aware of the studies that show the higher volumes of patients in a facility create better outcomes. Do we now want to water that down by increasing facilities that are not needed in certain areas (The CON works well for a reason).
I truly hope that you will seriously consider vetoing a bad bill if it remains the same at the end of Session.
On a more fun note, I did speak with Liza, and as soon as I know Wally Amos' schedule for the cookies we will put something wonderful together with you.
I hope you liked the cookies, Wally would love your opinion of them.
All my best,

The city of Deltona needs your help.  Thousands of our residents are at risk of losing their homes.  We were informed that our Mayor has requested a State of Emergency in order to proceed with flood relief plans ASAP.  

Please grant us a State of Emergency and help save thousands from the loss of what so many have worked so hard to build.  It is to late for the folks that have already lost their homes but we can still save many more.

Dr. Genshaft:
 
This is a follow-up to an earlier e-mail that I sent you regarding a complaint of possible racial discrimination. Although I specifically asked to meet with you to discuss this, I was directed to several other university employees. I provided each detailed information and conducted myself in accordance with university procedures.
 
At best (in terms of fairness), I have been told that many behaviors inflicted on me are not appropriate. I these cases, I have been told that action is not taken on inappropriate behaviors ... just illegal behaviors. In other cases, I have been told that being lied to by professors, being forced to violate university policy, and other similar behaviors are not inappropriate and warrant no action. The common factor is that no corrective action has taken place.
 
I have been acted against, however. Because I followed university policy and reported my concerns of possible racial discrimination, the following has happened to me:
 
1. My approved doctoral supervisory committee has been canceled.
2. My approved program of study has been compromised due to cancellation of my committee.
3. My approved research plan (submitted to the Institutional Review Board) has been compromised due to cancellation of my committee.
4. I have been assigned a doctoral supervisory committee that does not meet university guidelines.
5. I have been assigned a major professor that does not hold necessary credentialing to serve as major professor.
 
In essence, these five actions of the interim dean and interim department chair have the effect of immediately removing my doctoral program from compliance and for all practical purposes denying me equitable access to the university. These five actions are similar to the ones that I have been trying to address over the past weeks and (as explained to me in a recent meeting with the interim dean and interim department chair) have been mandated because I made a complaint. The dean stated so, during our tape-recorded meeting.
 
I wish that my request to meet with you would have been honored. If our meeting had taken place, perhaps such treatment would not have happened.

I just thought of an example to explain my interest in you as Gov/your policies.  Have you ever heard of the Christian writer named Josh McDowell?  He is based out of Texas.  He went through this stage where he was burned out on church, religion, didn't think there was a God, blah, blah, blah.  He was in college and met a group of people.  He noticed one girl was very different than the rest of the campus.  She smiled, was happy, at peace, etc.  He asked her what it was in her life that made her different.  She said, "Jesus Christ."  Well, that was enough to make Josh McDowell go nuts.  He was like, "I am sick of church, religion, etc."  The girl looked at him and said, "look mister, I didn't say RELIGION--I said Jesus Christ."  

Josh's Christian friends dared him to scientifically prove there was no God.  He was thinking about attending law school-- so he thought he could analytically prove there was no God.  Well, it backed fired.  The more research he did, the more he realized there HAD to be a God.  I think Josh now is with Campus Crusade for Christ.  So, he took all his research and came put it together in a piece called, "Evidence that Demands a Verdict."

OK---so when I first heard you speaking what your stances were---I was like, "this guy has to be joking...NO politican REALLY means this stuff." (well, I thought you were full of something).  So, the more I researched the more I found you were who you said. At first it stunned me.  I thought there was no way you really were into families, cried when spoke at churches, cared about drug abuse, etc.  I thought it was an act.  Well, you proved me wrong.  You are the real thing.  Trust me on this one.  I have read more about Jeb and Columba Bush than Jeb and Columba Bush have read about Jeb and Columba Bush.  You really are the real thing.  Thanks for proving me wrong.

However, now that the process has been completed,  I can applaud the Governing Boards' choice from the final eleven in selecting Dave Moore as the Executive Director.   As a current  Basin Board member I have worked with Dave over the past four years and he has done an admirable job in moving the district's programs forward.   I called Dave today and congratulated him on his selection and offered all possible support in the Districts future projects.

Subject:	Deltona Flooding

Dear Governor Bush.
I am one of the many homeowners that attened the
meeting in Deltona today on the flooding problem we
have. With all this rain we've been having lately,
the retention area that is in our backyard that used
to be dry is now flooded and overflowing in to our
yard. It must be 40 feet in to it and about a foot
or more deep and covers our entire backyard! We have
an above ground pool and the filter motor is in
water, our shed is sitting in water, we have fish
all over the yard!!
I'm writing this letter in hopes that you will issue
a state of emergency to the city of Deltona so that
the construction of drainage pipes can be installed
and the beginning process of draining the water in
the lakes can begin. The rainy season is coming and
if this matter isn't fixed real soon then lots of us
homeowners will lose our homes.
I'm not sure if you've seen the media pictures to
really see how bad it is here, if not I encourage
you to quickly take a ride to Deltona and see for
yourself just how bad it is here while where still
above water.
Thank you for reading this and all us here in
Deltona hope that you will be the one to provide us
with hope that we so dearly need.

from the bottom of my heart.  I am not worthy of your attention.  But, I am grateful. Dang, I eat it up. I fully expected when I first contacted your office in November asking to write about you that I would never hear anything.  I may not have voted for you (sorry) but, I am one of your biggest fans now!  (as if you couldn't tell).  I don't know what peeked an interest in you.  I think the faith-based policy, your views of God.  No, that did count---but, you know, when I saw your wife's PSA someone said, "that is the Governor's wife."  I thought she was great.  So, it was actually her and not you that made me take a second glance :)  We have to be the MOST blessed state in the country!  We BY FAR have the best Gov and First Lady in the nation.  I appreciate all you two do!  Everything you do is what I have been fighting for years in mental health and writing.  I so bummed when my university changed my dissertation from the Holocaust to FLA Foster Care.  But, you being Gov as made me want to finish my dissertation, get my PhD and go into public service.  I thought all Govs, Senators, etc. did was debate abortion, take prayer out of schools, etc.  I had no clue a public servant could talk about faith, helping children, reading, drug abuse, etc.  If you find yourself unemployed in 2007 (ha) you should think about becoming a family therapist (the rewards are great but the pay stinks).  You are TOO kind to me and TOO great for FL.  Thanks for agreeing to see me tomorrow.  PS--I hope you know that most of the females around here think your wife is cool. I did mission work in Mexico and have been in love with the culture/people ever since.  The First Lady really does add to your role as Gov. :)

Subject:	Arsenic, Artillery and Ashoura

To: Senator Bill Nelson

Arsenic, Artillery and Ashoura

I see your concern over arsenic in wood products but I don't see any concern
over the US artillery siege of Basra and bombing of Baghdad.

Perhaps I missed your regret for the loss of civilian lives...or maybe it's
on your priority list.

Also on that list must be a plan that subdues the 2 million souls in Basra
without killing them all. For you must subjugate them as they are Shia
Muslims with martyrdom in their daily lives. The "Liberation" canard now
appears as an inappropriate joke.

Indeed, they atone for the collective sins of abandoning their religious
leader on a 680AD battlefield...the Day of Atonement is called Ashoura. It
falls on March 24th each year...the day the British began throwing artillery
salvos into the central city.

Senator Nelson, I am the son of the late Captain Gordon Earnest Bolser who
was awarded the Navy Cross for valor in the skies above Pearl Harbor. I
trained military pilots in Viet Nam.

Bombing Basra on March 24th was equivalent to attacking America on Christmas
Day.

If you imagine for one minute that the citizens of Basra are going to
surrender only to become prisoners in their own country you are as arrogant
and misinformed as the recently fired Richard Perle.

Now we hear about the mines that Saddam placed that prevent delivery of
humanitarian relief. Here is my final point:

If the British batteries can deliver artillery rounds into central Basra,
how is it that they cannot deliver water and food?

Basra was "Taken" on the 20th...Lies from America.

My Father would rise from the dead if he only knew.

Subject:	School Choices All Around

Jeb,

While all eyes are on Iraq, the school choice movement quietly moves forward . . .

Dateline:  Colorado

 

In what looks to be the first new school voucher program since the Supreme Court ruling, Kevin Teasley from the  <http://www.geofoundation.org> Greater Education Opportunities sends word that:

After four years of struggle, educational activities, grassroots mobilizing, legislative coaxing, numerous fact trips to Milwaukee, and lots of endless meetings, Colorado will be the next state to adopt vouchers.  Today, the Colorado Senate approved House Bill 1160 which allows children in the state's lowest performing schools to take 85 percent of their funding to a private or parochial school of their choice.


 

The Wall Street Journal's John Fund reports on more details of the Colorado program:

The Colorado choice program is quite limited. It tightly restricts the number of eligible students in the early years to 6,000, limits participation to 12 districts where at least eight schools have been rated "low" or "unsatisfactory," and allows only students who qualify for free or reduced-price lunches to apply for a voucher equal to 85% of the state's portion of education costs. School districts lose nothing when a student takes his voucher to another school--except public acknowledgement that they failed that student. Just maybe that will prompt them to improve.

The House already approved 1160 and now it is a matter of procedure for the bill to be signed into law by Gov. Owens. 

 

Dateline: Florida

 

It looks like Florida will be a shoe-in again for number one in Manhattan Institute's  <http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/cr_14.htm> Education Freedom Index . Governor Bush continues his incremental approach to school choice. There are 15,000 students using the corporate tax credits with the $50 million a year cap to receive scholarships to private schools; several thousand students in charter schools; 10,000 students using McKay special education scholarships for private schools, a few hundred students from failing schools using opportunity scholarships; and now a proposal to satisfy the class-size reduction initiative by using scholarships to send kids to private schools; and finally a bill to use a tax-credits to offer scholarships to  <http://www.orlandosentinel.com/orl-locvouchers26032603mar26,0,1596791.story?coll=orl%2Dhome%2Dheadlines> soldiers' children .  

 

As the March 25  Sun-Sentinel reports:

The House answer to the voter mandate to cap class would allow parents of any child entering kindergarten to have a $3,500 state voucher to attend a private school and would also let school districts use vouchers to help reduce class size at any grade level.

As for the military tax credit the March 26 Sun-Sentinel reports:

The House approved a military voucher bill Tuesday after a bitter debate that crossed party lines. It provides $10 million in tax credits to corporations that donate money for scholarships enabling soldiers' children to attend private school. The bill was passed after a one-hour debate pitting veterans against one another and revolving around competing claims of patriotism.

 

Dateline: Arizona

 

 <http://www.goldwaterinstitute.org/index.php> The Goldwater Institute sends word that on, March 24, the Arizona State Senate delivered a victory for proponents of educational freedom. With a bipartisan majority of 16 votes, the Senate passed SB1263, a corporate scholarship tax credit program that could give thousands of low-income, public school students the opportunity to transfer to private schools next fall.

The legislation, based on an idea put forth in a Goldwater Institute research study <http://www.goldwaterinstitute.org/article.php/18.html>  last spring, would allow corporations to receive a dollar-for-dollar tax credit for donations to fund private school scholarships.  Those scholarships would be used to provide school choice for public school students who qualify for the federal free and reduced school lunch program. 

 <http://www.childrenfirstamerica.org/avfc/index.htm> Children's First America reports: 

The bill now goes to the House, where support is considered to be much stronger than in the senate. "Arizona already has an individual tax credit law in which citizens can direct up to $500 ($650 for couples) of their tax burden to organizations which grant scholarships for families to use at the school of their choice. Unlike the individual tax credit, however, the proposed corporate scholarships would be available only to those students currently enrolled in public schools who are eligible for the federal free or reduced-price lunch program. In addition, figures from legislative budget staffers indicate that the program will be revenue positive, as the state has a net gain of $2,000 per student that transfers. The measure would cap the scholarship fund at $10 million the first year, but that figure would rise to $50 million after four years.

Dateline: Compton

 

If there is anyplace that needs more competition and choice, Compton is the place. The Los Angeles Times reports on State Assemblyman Ray Haynes's   <http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-vouchers24mar24,1,7837914.story?coll=la%2Dheadlines%2Dcalifornia> bill  to give kids in Compton a way out.

 

The Compton experiment would be modeled after the highly popular Cal Grant program for college students, which provides the financially neediest students with grants of as much as $9,708 a year to pay tuition and student fees.

Haynes refused to detail his strategy for getting the bill approved in a Legislature dominated by Democrats who oppose vouchers. But he indicated that packaging the subsidies as scholarships similar to Cal Grant subsidies would make the bill more attractive to Democrats.

The plan would get a five-year test run, starting Jan. 1. The results would be evaluated and decisions made on whether to expand it elsewhere.

As a potential model for the rest of the state, Haynes said, Compton "was a good place to start.... What we need in Compton is a revolution." . . .

Haynes identified the sponsors of his bill as about 50 Compton parents and a nonprofit organization known as the Coalition on Urban Renewal and Education, a conservative, religion-based think tank with an office in Los Angeles. It was founded by commentator Star Parker, a one-time Los Angeles welfare mother who wrote the book "Pimps, Whores and Welfare Brats."

"We wanted to submit a bill that had to be taken seriously. We did not want a bill that would be thrown out because it was not constitutionally acceptable or credible," said Timothy McGhee, the organization's director of community affairs.

But Haynes said it will be very difficult to push the bill through the Legislature and get it signed by Gov. Gray Davis, who opposes vouchers. Haynes said he told the Compton parents that it would take lots of work and expansion of their group of 50 parents to "something more like 10,000" for the bill to succeed.

Dateline: Washington DC

 

President Bush has allocated $75 million in his fiscal-year 2004 budget to fund voucher programs in seven or eight cities, including Washington.

Arizona Rep. Jeff Flake has introduced the five-year, $45 million D.C. School Choice Act to provide vouchers for up to 8,300 students in the D.C. Public Schools. New Hampshire Sen. Judd Gregg's new bill authorizes $55 million in vouchers in DC over six years.

 

Dateline: New Hampshire

 

House Bill 603 offers parents about $1,700 if they choose to withdraw their child from the public school in their community. This would apply to homeschoolers and any parent who removed their child from the public schools.

 

Dateline: Texas

 

A bipartisan group of legislators has  <http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/viewpoints/stories/032403dnedilara.c8f27.html> proposed a pilot school choice bill , known as the Texas freedom scholarship program, to address both academic achievement and overcrowding problems in Texas public schools.  Large urban districts where a majority of students are educationally and economically disadvantaged qualify for the pilot program.


  _____  

For more school choice news, see the March 2003  <http://www.rppi.org/2003schoolchoice.html> Privatization Watch  education issue, where I explore the growing menu of school choice options across the United States. 

For any one who doubts that kids want out, the New York Times  <http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/27/education/27SCHO.html> reports that more than 16,000 New York City children have demanded transfers under a federal law that gives parents the right to request to move their child to a better-performing school.

A few thousand kids here and there and pretty soon we are talking about real children and real competition.

Subject: Legislative Issues, Etc.


I still have this compelling need to speak my mind about legislation.. Thanks for understanding:
1   DROP - We need to be very careful when we consider extending DROP for teachers and school administrators. There needs to be very strict criteria in order to do so, if we do it at all. Too many of the teachers that are currently scheduled to go out need to go ahead and go out when their DROP period ends this June 30.   It will probably help the teacher shortage and certainly should be considered for teachers; but, we must be sure to use due diligence when the criteria for extension is developed.  Our teacher evaluation systems are quite weak due to union negotiations. Teachers either meet a standard or they need improvement.  There's no place on our evaluation form (except for comment section) for excellence to be identified. 
        In particular, we must be even more careful with the extension of DROP for school administrators.  Again, these people probably need to move on out into the greener pastures of retirement after their 5 years of DROP.  School districts have had 5 years to plan for this exit. We have discussed it in school districts for 5 years.  School districts should have been planning and cultivating leaders to take over our schools. According to my colleagues around the state, rather than plan for this "event," school districts have been hoping for a change in the law. Quite frankly, I hope it is not extended for administrators.    
 
You must also be careful that school districts do not manipulate the law to preserve district office staff who went on DROP with the full intention of retiring after their 5 years, but now want to continue participating in this lucrative benefit.  These people are the highest paid in the school district and will continue to receive pay raises, etc. if their DROP is extended
 
I will have a total of 34 1/2 years in education (33 in public; 1 1/2 in private) on July 1 and I am signing up for DROP at that time.  By the time I finish DROP (if I complete it), I will have 38 years in Florida's public schools. (I started teaching when I was 12!) That will probably be quite enough! 
 
2.  Bright Futures -  I am glad that there are some initiatives to raise the standard for Bright Futures.  Our SAT requirement was below the national average.  While I believe that all students should have access to as much education as they can successfully complete, I do think that the bar was set too low for this scholarship.
 
3.  Vouchers - Although I have never been a proponent of vouchers, I have really had my eyes opened.  Some children simply can't cope/exist/be successful or whatever in the huge schools that we operate in the public sector.  Our school was built for probably 900 - 1000 students.  We have 1600+ students (24% ESE- that we can only discipline in a limited fashion), and 30+ portables. It really is a good school, despite the diverse area that our school serves (New Smyrna Beach, Edgewater, Oak Hill, etc). The school has received A & B designation.  School districts continue to cut school based services when time comes to tighten budgets.  (Last year our school district did not cut or reduce one position at the director level or above, but did cut school services to meet budget cuts!...and I imagine other school districts are the same.)  There must be some relief for the parents of children who aren't particularly "troubled" or "academically behind," but simply can't be successful in such an environment.  For one such parent (who can't afford private school tuition), my only resource for her son was to refer him to our alternative school for disruptive students.  SOOOOO, I told her about our corporate tax credits that supported scholarships for students to go to private schools.  I called the DoE, got the number of Florida Child, and called the parent back and gave it to her as another option.   I hope it works for her.  If we need to provide vouchers for students in overcrowded schools to remedy our overcrowded conditions, then maybe that's what we need to do!  
 
4.  FCAT - Not legislative, but still a real issue.  I'm the testing coordinator at our school so I organized the administration of the FCAT.  Governor, it's not the test that's the main issue (although I think we as educators have blown it way out of proportion....good teachers teach the right things to students that they should know for FCAT or any test), it's the bureaucracy in administering it.....I'll save that for another email, but I do have some suggestions to help school personnel administer the test I.e. scanners, and other technology! (It really shouldn't be hard, it someone can develop the program for it!  I know what could be done, but I don't know how to do it!)  As usual, everything is blamed on the legislature.  I assured people at a meeting I attended today that our legislators (and governor) would be appalled if they knew the time spent on organizing the test materials prior to and after test administration.....This should be done in another email....Later!
 
I hope I haven't bored you.  Thank you for all you do!

Dear Governor Bush:

Are you aware of this? 

Ven Sequenzia

The Advocacy Center has learned that the House appropriations committee may include proviso language (for line item 294) in the 2003-2004 budget that could result in cuts to services.

Advocates report that the proposed proviso language would prohibit the DD Program from carrying forward any of its projected deficit of 28.7 million into the next budget year. The language is scheduled for consideration tomorrow morning - Friday March 28, 2003 at the Knot Building, Room 212, 9:00 a.m.

The language would require the Department to certify that the DD Program is out of deficit prior to the release of 2003-2004 funds ($37,512,360 General Revenue and $42,796,423 Trust fund). 

Advocates are concerned that the DD Program may have to significantly cut services, provider rates and/or limit eligibility if the proviso language is included in the budget bill.

Judge Robinson is a fine person, she is deeply rooted in our community not to mention her legal acumen, understanding of the law and her ability apply it equally and fairly, Judge Robinson is without doubt, deserving of the opportunity to elevate to the Circuit Division here in Broward County.

Complaint Regarding
Models International in Miami Beach

_____________

Dont be taken by the glitz and glamour of these sweet talking, dream building women, the women of Miami Beach Model Showcase. I attended an open call they were holding in the mall in my town of Sarasota, FL. After making the first cut i was asked to attend a personal interveiw the next day. at the interveiw, they talked to us(the finalists) about the model showcase they hold in miami in late august. after the interview..i was chosen as one of the 10 people they could take from my city to miami. at this showcase, there are said to be(and as i saw in the video they had us watch while waiting to be interveiwed) that over 80 top agencys from all over the world attend this showcase, and offer many contracts. once deciding that i wanted to go, my mother and I(since im only 17) were asked to sign a release, for me to go, they also wanted a deposit of 485.00, to secure my spot. along with this agreement, i was to attend 6 "workshops" paying 365.00 to 500.00, everytime i attended, and attendance to the workshops was mandatory in order to go to the showcase..so all in all, the grand total of attending this showcase was 2,789. well...at the time, (they wanted the deposit that day) but my mother didnt have enough left on her credit card to charge it(u had to pay with a credit card) so they agreed to take my moms credit number down, and exchange t with my dads, when he got back to them. a few days went by, and after long research and discussion, my parents decided it wasnt best for me to go. when my mother called the president of MBMS, and told her that they could not afford to send me, the president did not agree, and demanded payment of the deposit, even though i wasnt going to attend the workshops or showcase. when my mom refused, the president of MBMS said she would simply get as much out of my moms credit card as possible, if we did not pay her. THIS IS A SCAM!!!!! they should have simply said thank you, and we will have someone else fill your daughters spot. THEY ARE SIMPLY IN IT FOR THE MONEY! I STRONGLY ADVISE THAT NO ONE ATTEND ONE OF THEIR OPEN CALLS! PLEASE POST THIS, MY FAMILY WAS ALMOST OUT 4,000 BECAUSE OF THESE FRAUDS!!! MATTERS ARE STILL PENDING. NAIVE, BEWARE! thanks geri.

Subject: Models International in Miami Beach
My daughter and I just returned from a weekend trip to Miami Beach, (we live in Northern VA) where she was supposed to have a 4-5 hr. photo shoot with Models International, on Ocean Drive, in South Beach, Miami. The photo shoot was scheduled for Saturday, August 25th at 11:00 am, we were told to be there at 10:30 am, and that there would be a hairdresser, photographer, and make-up person there. We arrived at the office at 10:20 am, with all the clothes, shoes, boots, and accessories we were told to bring and no one was there! We hung around until after 11:00 am, whereupon one of the maintenance men told us that one of the photographers from that company told him that Models International was filing for bankrupty! In the meantime I had paid them 1/2 of the fee for the photography session and composite cards, which was in the amount of $540.00, plus a $71.00 cab ride from Ft; Lauderale Airport, plus 2 noights in a hotel, which was close to $200.00, plus meals out, plus my palne ticket! The whole thing was strange, as Models International DID pay for my daughter's plane ticket out there, but I had to pay for mine. Why would they do that if they weren't interested in her? It makes no sense to me, except that the plane ticket was less than the 1/2 deposit payment that I allocated on my credit card. Be wary of them though!i

In an e-mail a few weeks ago you asked me how the JNC worked out or 
something to this effect? With all that you're juggling I really appreciate 
you thinking of me and wondering how I am doing. Well, the list of 12 people 
just came out today. It is clear that the JNC worked for the people who 
voted for years to keep your dad out of office, voted for years to keep you 
and your brother out of office, but it didn't work for me. I believe that 
every JNC commissioner and every judicial applicant should have to sign an 
oath stating that, neither they, nor anyone on their behalf, has had any 
discussion or made any agreement with anyone on the JNC or their agents in 
exchange for legal business or money. There would be no reason why any 
commissioner or judicial applicant would refuse to sign this oath.I know 
through various sources that judgeships are for sale in this county in 
exchange for money and promises of legal business.
I also know of your personal integrity and know that this goes against who 
you are and what you stand for. Clearly, if the particular individuals who 
are the subject of my complaint had your character and sense of morality and 
decency, I wouldn't be writing this letter.

I need to do a lot of thinking about whether this unethical conduct would be 
better handled by contacting legislators of both parties regarding the oath 
just mentioned or by filing a Florida bar complaint against the appropriate 
JNC member, who happens to be a lawyer, or by considering some other 
options. (There are also other Republican lawyers in high positions who are 
involved and who should perhaps be looked at by the Florida Bar.)Since these 
people are lawyers it may be good for the Florida Bar to examine their 
conduct.
I will have to look to God for guidance and hope that I have the good sense 
to follow his direction. I do know that "to do nothing" is not one of my 
options. Someday I will be a judge as I have been promised  that I can be 
anything I want to be. When I do become a judge I will be indebted to 
everyone yet indebted to no one. This is the only way that I can truly serve 
the people in the way that I should. Every person coming before a judge is 
somebody's mother, somebody's father,  somebody's brother or sister and 
somebody's child. As they stand in court they should at least be assured 
that they are standing before a judge who truly strives to treat everyone 
equally, who is indebted to no one yet indebted to everyone, and who yearns 
to make the best decision.

You will be appointing a new member to the JNC in July. Not all members of 
the Broward JNC are unethical. In fact, some of the members of the Broward 
JNC are wonderful people who just want to do what is right. As you make this 
decision, please do everything possible to appoint a person who doesn't have 
an agenda to pad his or her own pocketbook.

I recall that history would be changed forever and I would not have my 
American President, of whom I am so proud, if it had not been for one 
Supreme Court Justice, who dared to do the right thing. Just one judge, 
dedicated to that which is just and that which is right, can make all the 
difference in the world.

Dear Jeb:
I know over the years I have given you a hard time about some of your choices of key people especially Michael Moore and now James Crosby. And I was right about both. Ha Ha But I met Mike Hanna when we were in Tallahassee a few weeks ago for the prison reform rally and he gave me his card and said if I had a problem I could call him. Well, Crosby tried a fast one he acted like he was going to help Kevin by moving him to Charlotte to get a fresh start. He did do that but then moved some of his goons from FSP Lt. Poccia and C/O Glover also to finish Kevin off. They immediately told everyone at Charlotte Kevin was a trouble maker and so was I. Then they started tormenting him with Crosby sent us here to gas at will with this new stronger gas FOX and make Charlotte like FSP. Of course Kevin got upset and said you won't get away with that. So they have started gassing him and giving him disorderly conduct DR's they are the ones that are disorderly. What kind of a fresh start is that Jeb. If Crosby thinks for one minute I'm going to stand by and let him plan my son's murder when he only has a hundred days left in prison he's sadly mistaken. I really thought maybe I was wrong about him but I was right all along he is an evil person. Then when Mike asked him about transferring these officers he lied and said he didn't. They say he did now who's lying Jeb? Any way Mike is helping me and is really a tribute to his job and DOC. These are the kind of people you should have running DOC not evil people like Crosby tuff but fair and someone that listens to both sides. Hats off to you on Mike Hanna I hope you will keep him around he about your only asset to DOC you have right now. Also let George W know the real Americans love and support him one hundred percent and pray for him everyday. 

                                                                             Janice Smith

Subject: Available for challenging issues


Dear Most Honorable Governor, Brother of The Utmost Spiritual President,
     In lieu of the status of our country & conditions & sacrifices regarding our defenders, I have come to view my personal challenges & wrongdoings by the system directed at me as but a grain of sand tumbling along on the beach of life-none but more pain & suffering which is what builds character & wisdom.  Therefore I am writing to let you know I had to yield to the denial of my unemployment case, which was turned down because I did not present all of my personal medical conditions playing a part in my resignation from the nursing home therapy job.  Yes I was harassed by the rehab lead, whose personality is one of omnipotence, whose intellect & degrees stands out & protects him from the small fry as myself, a Christian woman with 13 years in recovery & having spent time in prison when younger, & who you approved to restore my civil rights & help me back then when the system was taking me down. That man will have to answer to God someday for the way he treats patients & his part in bilking money from the Medicare system, but as said, who knows well how to cover his a-- & appear to bring in the bucks for that particular nursing home. (by the way, there are several lawsuits against that place, & I believe they are not frivolous, knowing it as I did in the over 3 years of employ-I had to quit else lose my moral values)  
     Sadly, I am under chemotherapy now & unable to work, & had to apply for disability.  Stress can exacerbate ones medical problems, & working in the nursing home business is taking its toll on hundreds of others in middle age, some are nurses who are leaving for similar reasons.  I had a patient fall on me onto the bed as trying to get him to his feet, he also sat during gait training without warning into his wheelchair, which all caused more herniated discs in my neck & back.  Therefore, my doctor had me file a claim for my injuries which the nursing home is denying any fault.  I have, as many other 51 year olds, early degenerative disc disease or osteoarthritis, which began when doing time when younger from the hard labor required in prison work as well as hard beds.  Many people who have done time end up with similar medical problems later in life.  However, being an athletic type woman, I was able to overcome my condition, go to school, become a physical therapy assistant (PTA) & retain my licensure when the background check laws came to be thanks to your help.  But due to the nursing home problems my family suffered through, I ultimately became blackballed from the field, & labeled by some a whistleblower.  The thing is, I have yet to actually officially become a whistleblower, but am willing if anyone wants a witness to certain commonplace practices.  I am nothing more to lose Governor.  I applied for several jobs, tried to work in my field, but cannot because of medical reasons.  I obtained the counseling degree, but because of a bad rap by that former boss, I had no job offers.  Then having to undergo this chemo for new medical conditions, I cannot work, which has lead to the sale of my car & putting my new home up for sale, else I will become one of Florida's homeless.  Out of all of this, I realize God allows these things to happen, because in order to have a testimony, one must first undergo a test.  And that is what I am enduring right now, one big test, one which will allow me to come back with a bang once this treatment is over.  
     I know you are backlogged with letters & requests.  All I want from you is to consider using me someday.  For instance, giving us felons civil rights back automatically after completion of sentence would be a dire mistake.  Do you know how many people who have been in trouble truly recover, and how many continue to lie, cheat, steal, use drugs, & get over & make people believe they are upstanding citizens when their lives are not such.  The parole commission had to do a complete background on me to discover if I was worthy of civil rights.  It was a long process, & yes, it should be simplified to be more cost effective, as it was very expensive for my case alone, as my record stretched back to 1974 in Virginia, which they spent hours and hours researching.  And my record is actually very short compared to most of who you are dealing with.  Please DO NOT let them automatically give back civil rights, else you will have a bunch of actively using ex-felons voting in possibly the same types into offices.  
     Governor, God bless you, your family, your Brother, and please remember me, for I have so much to offer, I have been around and know the human mind, from several angles.  I could hold office if given the opportunity.  I should be strong enough soon to put in some hours especially when it comes to researching issues.  I look to actually meet you soon-please don't forget me-God has a plan else I would not have gotten the MA degree to back me, nor go through all the challenges & financial strain I am enduring.  I have consistently been discriminated against in my job search but not one agency would ever admit the real reason for not hiring me.  Although I cannot work at this time, I will be able to at least volunteer time soon.  I just need someone to snatch me up, use me for my knowledge and life experiences with recovery & jail issues.   God Bless America,  Winnie (Winifred) Buman McDavid

Dear Jeb        :
As you may know, for the past several months, the Broward Alliance has been refocusing its core mission of economic development. Among other things, it decided to eliminate the position of Vice President of Education and Government Relations. It has terminated my employment as of the end of this month. It has been rewarding working with you on our mutual concerns of economic development and quality of life. Your dedication and professionalism have been for me stimulating, encouraging, and supporting, and I am proud to be part of a community eager to collaborate in order to resolve its issues and address its concerns. I may be calling on you soon to explore how I can help move your agendas forward. In any event, I have no doubt our paths will again cross as I pursue other endeavors. Continuity of service and representation of The Broward Alliance on committees or boards will be decided by Joan Goodrich, to whom you may direct your inquiries (954.627.0127, jgoodrich@browardalliance.org). I am retaining my cell number on my own account (954.383.0654), and my email is Majzlin@aol.com for the present.

without a cap on non economic damages, it will be very difficult to

even when there wasn't malpractice committed. It is good hearing from

Governor:  I haven't written to you for a while; but I am doing so today
to
forward an email recently sent by a friend and former student of mine. I
agree with what he is saying. In this rush to take away money from the
one
person who did nothing wrong - the injured patient, we forget that there
really is medical malpractice and it is serious in both numbers and in
degree. A recent study by the medical profession itself found that only
2%
of actual malpractice ever makes it to the legal environment. If
malpractice
itself were reduced, the problem would be reduced. I agree there are
some
frivolous cases; but there are also insurance companies who refuse to
settle
reasonable cases and that results in law suits to force them to act. Any
solution should involve not only restructions on lawyers; but also
restructions on insurance companies and much, much stricter rules for
doctors. The reality is that if I commit malpractice as a lawyer, my
name
will go to the court for review for discipline. The same will not happen
to
a doctor and even then the doctor will be treated lightly. Governor, I
served as an administrative law judge in Maryland for a special medical
malpractice court. I saw the same names over and over again becuase
medical
regulation was less than effective. I know that my brothers at the bar
do
things that are wrong and troubling; but the real blame still likes with
physicians who don't regulate themselves and a less than vigorous state
regulatory system. You have the power and the vision to make a
difference
and you have take courageous stands before. We need that again so that
the
responsibilty for this is spread across the spectrum to include
physicians.
Thanks and as always, be well.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Medical malpractice damage caps fail to result in better medicine, but
do protect bad doctors.  The State of Maryland has had caps on
non-economic damages for years, I know because part of my practice was
medical malpractice defense work when I actively practiced law in
Maryland.  Notwithstanding that protection, the medical community has
become worse at policing its own.  Evidence of that is directly
presented in the attached article from the March 21, 2003, publication
of the Washington Post.  The Maryland Legislature is threatening to have
the State of Maryland take over the Medical Board that oversees doctors
because the Board has repeatedly failed to discipline doctors in
Maryland who make medical mistakes.  This clearly demonstrates that
having the State of Florida impose caps does nothing but adversely
affect those who have been the victims of medical malpractice and
protect doctors who are not disciplined by their very own profession.

Why "protect" doctors when they themselves will not protect the public
from their own?

Maryland Lawmakers Take Aim at Medical Board

Sen. Paula C. Hollinger has joined Hurson in proposing to abolish the
board if standards aren't toughened. (File Photo)

By David Snyder and Jo Becker
Washington Post Staff Writers
Friday, March 21, 2003; Page B02

Maryland lawmakers moved yesterday to crack down on bad doctors, saying
the board that is supposed to regulate physicians has repeatedly failed
to discipline those who make mistakes.

Unable to work out a compromise with the association that represents
Maryland's doctors, legislators in the House and Senate threatened to
abolish the state Board of Physician Quality Assurance. In its stead,
responsibility for reviewing mistakes and misconduct would be put in the
hands of a state agency -- allowing less input from the medical
community.

According to an October 2000 report by the state's Office of Legislative
Audits, 140 of the 493 open complaints against doctors filed with the
board went unresolved for as long as four years, although state law
requires that investigations should be completed "in a timely fashion,"
generally understood to be less than 18 months.

The Federation of State Medical Boards found in a 2000 study that only
10 other states disciplined a lower percentage of their licensed
doctors. The oversight board "is very geared toward doing nothing" about
doctor malfeasance, said Del. John A. Hurson (D-Montgomery). "The
culture of the board has led to a very limited number of disciplines."

Hurson and Sen. Paula C. Hollinger (D-Baltimore County) tried last year
to strengthen the board by lowering the standard of proof needed to find
patient complaints actionable. The effort was defeated after heavy
lobbying by the Maryland State Medical Society. This year, with the
legislation again meeting heavy opposition and stalled in committee, the
lawmakers have decided to give the group a reason to come to the table.

Jay Schwartz, a lobbyist for the Maryland State Medical Society,
attributed the board's low disciplinary rates to its current members,
many of whom were appointed by former governor Parris N. Glendening (D).
Schwartz said lowering the standard of proof would not help.

The legislation establishing the board is scheduled to expire this year,
unless the General Assembly reauthorizes it.

Bills submitted yesterday would turn over supervision of doctor
discipline to the state Department of Health and Mental Hygiene -- an
even less attractive option for the Medical Society because it could
largely eliminate peer oversight.

Currently, 10 of the 15 board members must be licensed physicians
selected from a list submitted to the governor by the Medical Society,
according to legislative analysts.

When doctors are accused of misconduct, two-member peer review panels
investigate. Hurson contended that no action is taken unless both
doctors agree that the complaint has merit.

In addition, Maryland is one of 15 states that uses a "clear and
convincing" standard for convicting doctors of misconduct, which means
that a peer jury must be about 80 percent sure of the evidence in order
to convict. Hurson and Hollinger have sought the "preponderance of the
evidence" standard, used by 34 states, which requires only that the peer
jury be more than 50 percent sure that there is enough evidence to
convict.

The argument about the standard of proof has been the primary sticking
point between the Medical Society and lawmakers for nearly two years.
The society has agreed to nearly 40 changes in the existing law,
Schwartz said, but has not compromised on the standard-of-proof issue.

As a result, legislation that would require changes has languished in
Senate and House committees this legislative session. Hurson said the
Medical Society has held up the votes, but Schwartz said his lobbying
group does not control the individual votes of legislators.

"It's been a year-and-a-half process," Schwartz said. "They've got
problems getting the votes in committee, they've got problems getting
votes on the Senate floor. If they just can't get the votes, then maybe
it's not such a good idea."

MAMMOGRAMS:  PROCEDURE INVITES FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS

 Once again we are being misled. The medical care crisis is not about the cost or availability of malpractice insurance. Instead, it is a crisis of medical access.

This crisis will impact every family in the state, because physicians performing high-risk procedures eventually will cease providing care.

Please understand that we have a responsibility to ensure that our

we have decided it is in the best interests of the Department to excercise

      This letter is in reference to our daughter, Emilee L. Pacher,
who is a
      client of the Department of Children and Families Developmental
Services
      District 2 Panama City, and her Personal Caregiver, Jacquelyn D.
Bruce.

      Our daughter is twelve years old and has both Down Syndrom and
Autism.  She
      recently has the diagnosis of new onset grand mal seizures.  As
you can
      imagine, it is tremendously difficult to find someone whom you
trust to
      assist in taking care of your child.  It is even more difficult
when that
      child has a disability and cannot communicate with you.  Our
daughter is
      unable to tell us if anyone treated her kindly or if anyone did
something
      unspeakable to her.

      When Mrs. Bruce is with our child we have no worries.   She has
been Emilee'
      s personal care give since June 2002.   She treats Emilee with
the up most
      respect and with the care and attention she treats her own
children.  She is
      the adoptive mother of an eighteen year old that was a victim of
child
      abuse, an eleven year old that was put in the foster care system
as an
      infant and ultimately had a stroke at age three due to the lack
of nutrition
      he received from his foster family, and is a legal guardian of a
six year
      old disabled child whose parents did not want to care for her
any longer.

      Mrs. Bruce received a letter from Mac McCoy earlier this month
stating as of
      April she would no longer have a license to care for children
and would no
      longer have her license as a Residential Respite and Medical
Foster Care
      Home.   Her's is the only Medical Foster Care Home within three
counties.
      She was not given a reason for this nor a grievance process to
follow. Mrs.
      Bruce has had these licenses for three years and has never had a
complaint
      against her.  We are appalled at the fact that someone's
livelihood can be
      taken away from her with just a letter from Mr. McCoy without
asking the
      parents of those children  or the children themselves if there
were any
      problems.

      We have been so please with the care our daughter has received
over the past
      nine months and are saddened that the Department would do this
to a person
      who has cared for so many children over the past years.  Even at
times
      without payment. We will not find another person to care for our
daughter.
      We will have to pay for Mrs. Bruce's services ourselves.  She is
the one
      person our daughter is comfortable with and we don't feel that
we should
      have to put Emilee through the horrors of allowing a stranger to
assist with
      her personal care.  If you have ever been around an Autistic
child, you know
      that it is extremely difficult for the child to trust a
stranger.  I have
      seen Emilee become relaxed and comfortable with Mrs. Bruce and
am satisfied
      that she is the best person to care for her.

      On behalf my daughter, our family, and other disabled members of
our
      community and their families we are asking that you please
reinstate Mrs.
      Bruce's license. We will be happy to speak with anyone
concerning this
      matter as it relates to Emilee.  In the end, we feel confidant
that Mrs.
      Bruce will be able to continue to care for our children and
those who have
      caused her so much distress over the past month will apologize
for their
      mistakes and realize that Mrs. Bruce is an asset as a
representative of the
      Department of Children and Families.

      We have not called the local office of the Department of
Children to speak
      with anyone concerning this.   We are not attempting to find out
any private
      matters between Mrs. Bruce and the Department.  We fell this is
the only way
      to let everyone know how we feel in regards to our daughter.  We
have to be
      an advocate for Emilee.  She is unable to let us know how she
feels
      verbally, but when she sees Mrs. Bruce we see a smile on her
face and she
      does things for her that she will not do for others.  That means
more to us
      than we are able to tell you.  Please don't hesitate to contact
us if we can
      be of further assistance to you in this matter.  We know all the
parents of
      the children Mrs. Bruce has cared for over the past few years
will be happy
      to give her the same praise as we have.


      Sincerely,


      Brenda J. and Billy L. Pacher

Hello:  I have been out of the office because of escorting the
multi-region program on environmental issues.  Yes, we would like to
share what we do and why we do it.  There are at this time 177,000
volunteers who assist with the International Visitor Program under the
auspices of the U.S. Department of State.  The International Visitor
Program is a foreign policy program and is rated by our Ambassadors as
one of their number one tools to build relationships and understanding
of America.  Our job here in Central Florida is to create professional
appointments as well as cultural.  Our International Visitors are here
to learn: how local government works,  exchanges with our local law
enforcement, campaigns issues, economic development and incubators, how
to partner with private and local government, water issues, waste
issues, education as well as taxes, the rule of law etc.
We introduce to the International Visitor our community and culture.  We
hope to give them a better understanding of the American culture and
undo the misconceptions our visitors have from our media.  The program
is called Citizen Diplomacy and the volunteers are Citizen Diplomats.
We would be pleased to share the International Visitor Program concepts
and hopefully have more cities participate in Citizen Diplomacy.  Thank
You Patricia

Dear Ms. Gehri:

I am writing to invite you or someone from your organization to share
what
you do with the attendees at our academy for locally elected officials
April
25-26th in Orlando at the Radisson I-4.

We want to introduce the participants to the International Visitor
Program,
as well as how they can support it within their communities.  Learning
about
your program and making contact with their local offices I think would
be
very helpful in rounding out their education on international
possibilities.

I am attaching a draft program for your information, and we are still
arranging some speakers so we are somewhat flexible.  We hope you will
be
able to participate in a speaking capacity at one of the sessions, which
are
now planned from 4-5 pm on Friday the 25th, or during the afternoon
Friday.

I will be pleased to discuss the program further at 800-616-1513 ext.
115 at
your convenience, as well.  Thank you in advance for your consideration,
and
please let us know at your earliest convenience.

Attached you will find an initial look at the numbers and the regions that have been trained by John Kohnke and myself on the FOG. Overall more than 1,500 persons have attended the training and we have been met with overwhelming understanding of the FOG, unified command and the role of the RDSTF. As you can see by the schedule it has been an aggressive one and will continue to be so until all of the command and control for the RDSTF's have been covered.
 
I am also pleased to say that the audience has been truly interdisciplinary. At least 10 elected sheriffs have attended, nearly all of the chairs and co-chairs of the RDSTF, very good fire and law enforcement attendance, hospitals, health, emergency management, DEP and state fire marshals office. We have also had some private industry, university's and the like also in attendance.
 
Thanks to each of you for your patience in allowing John and I to get this important information out and we will submit a final report to you at the conclusion of our road trip.............Dave

Subject:	EMERGENCY IN DELTONA, FL.

Dear Governor: 

There are sections of Deltona which already have been flooded with people losing their homes. The city has been impeded by a few citizens who want high water for their boats. Otherwise they have been planning a solution, though a bit belatedly, to put in a drainage system. This is also stymied by the apparent need for the state government to declare a "state of emergency", so they can proceed posthaste. 

The rains have been at 100 year levels and with another 6 inches will have flooded out hundreds of additional homes. This applies to a large area but articles have said it could be 33% of the town. There is so much hyperbole that one can not really know all the truth. But the facts are that this is serious and we apparently need State intervention to clear the way for a solution. 

Therefore I beg of you to intervene quickly to allow this work to proceed. 

This is supposedly the "dry" season but in fact it has not been so. We still face the summer rains with "El Nino" dumping heavy rains again on us and with the hurricane seaon coming on. That latter would make the whole city a disaster area. 

Please, governor, act on this to whatever extent you can and help our local governments to get busy pursuing a remedy. This is most urgent. 

I have been a supporter of yours and would most urgently request your interventioon our behalf 

Sincerely 

Floyd Wilson

There will be 37 students and 10 adults.  They will work for photo if necessary by lobbying Sen. King for caps when they see him.

Governor, 

	I wanted to provide you an update on Sergeant First Class (SFC)
Lloyd S. Clements, Jr. who passed away at Fort Bliss, Texas on March 26,
2003.  He had suffered a heart attack on March 25, 2003 and died the next
day.  Outlined below is a summary of personal information on SFC Clements:

Name:  SFC Lloyd S Clements Jr; Florida Army National Guard

DOB:   22 June 1947

Spouse Name:  Cynthia Clements

HOR:  111E Villa Capri Circle Apt A
      Deland Florida  32724
	
Sons:  Paul Clements (19)
       Frank Clements (24)
       James Clements (29)

Parents:  Deceased

Hometown:  Deland

Assignment: Deployed under Operation Iraqi Freedom, Sgt. Clements was a
light wheeled vehicle mechanic and motor supervisor.  He left on March 18 to
Fort Bliss, Texas with Battery A, 1st Battalion, 265th Air Defense
Artillery, based out of Palatka

Mrs. Clements is still in El Paso, Texas with her sons, but should return to
Florida either Saturday or Sunday.  The 2d Battalion, 265th Air Defense
Artillery of the Florida Army National will conduct the military funeral.
There will be an honor guard detail to meet the casket when it arrives at
Daytona Airport.  I will have a General Officer at the funeral.

The best method to contact Mrs. Clements at this time is through her cell
phone at (386) 848-7460.  If she is not available through her cell phone,
the unit officer assisting the family is Captain Rawlins at (386) 804-5028.
Captain Rawlins can be contacted and he can arrange for the family to be at
a telephone to receive your call.  Mrs. Clements' home telephone number is
(386) 738-5253 and her work telephone number is (386) 736-6753, ext. 20827. 

Below is an e-mail from our Regional Training Site Maintenance commander
that speaks of one of SFC Clements' last assignments.  It is a great loss
for the Florida National Guard and our state.  I appreciate your personal
concern for the welfare of our Guardsmen and their families.

It is with profound regret that the we, the staff of the RTSM, read about
the passing of SFC Lloyd S. Clements Jr. while on mobilization with his unit
at Ft. Bliss. I want to give you some information about him that you can
pass on the State Command Sergeant Major and the Adjutant General.

SFC Clements just graduated from his Phase 3 BNCOC here at the RTSM on 16
Feb 03, attending the 63B30 Course. He was the oldest soldier, and provided
a positive influence on his class. In fact, the DA Form 1059 (Academic
Evaluation Report) issued to him states: 

	"Staff Sergeant Clements displayed a positive attitude toward his

He also scored an average of 96% on his written tests.

From his Phase 1 DA Form 1059, he had the comment: "Displayed excellent
teamwork in achieving squad goals."

One of his instructors here said that SFC Clements took a lot of personal
time to work with the instructors to correctly prepare his dress uniform and
to continue his development of NCO skills along side of the technical
training he was receiving during the course.

Thought I'd give you a little history on SB 260 -- which allows condominium
owners to fly military colors on patriotic holidays. . . . A New Port Richey
man, George Fischer,  contacted me last June because he got in trouble for
flying his Marine Corps flag on Memorial Day. We did a story, contacted Sen.
Mike Fasano and got a bill filed in Legislature ((HB 181 (Kevin Ambler)
co-sponsor). The bill is flying through the legislature and George is
watching it daily. This retired marine is getting a marvelous civics lesson.
He calls this the hilight of his life because he is helping so many other
vets show their patriotism. 

He calls me frequently with updates. It's kind of cool to experience.

Please have your office let me know when you plan to sign the legislation
(passed Senate awaiting final passage in House) so we can cover it. 


Thanks,


Don

This is the lawyer that I had previously written to you about.   He is a Broward County lawyer with Stephens, Lynn and Klein.  He is a bright, conservative lawyer who has dedicated his adult life to defending hospital, physicians and other healthcare providers in professional liability cases.   He has an excellent legal mind, keen sense of justice and equity and strong work ethic.   His experience with medical negligence cases will prove to be extremely valuable.

PERMISSION TO PUBLISH:

 

 

"Comparing Dallas ISD and Houston ISD"

March 28, 2003

by Donna Garner

 

(Word Count -- 396) 

 

A point of interest regarding the newly released spring scores on the TAKS third-grade reading tests: I find it very intriguing that the passing rate in Houston ISD was 84%; the passing rate in Dallas ISD was 75.5%. Both are large school districts of somewhat equal demographics except for the fact that Houston ISD with its geographic position on the coastline undoubtedly has many more limited-English speakers than does Dallas ISD. 

 

I have carefully observed the progress of these two districts over the years, and I think it is safe to say that the difference between the two lies in their administrative leadership. Years ago Houston ISD was bold enough to require their students to take the Stanford 9 and make those scores known to the public. Houston also was one of the first big school districts in Texas to focus on the importance of the National Institutes of Health reading research and to make an attempt to train teachers in the importance of phonemic awareness/decoding skills.

 

Meanwhile, Dallas played the "stick-the-head-in-the-sand" game. At the very same time that Houston was coming to grips with the fact that their students couldn't read and that reading instruction simply had to improve,  Dallas ISD hired some sort of a highly paid district reading czar who was basically a whole-language proponent. Under his leadership (or lack thereof), the Dallas administrators and teachers continued to support whole-language instruction to the detriment of the children in that district. 

 

Whereas the Houston teachers are well on their way to improving their reading instruction, Dallas is still stuck in a quagmire of inept whole-language techniques and fix-it-quick intervention attempts. Their superintendent and curriculum directors still have not caught the vision; children must have well-defined, direct, systematic instruction.

 

Dallas ISD Supt. Mike Moses has done little if anything to point the district in the right direction toward the scientifically/medically based reading research, and I for one believe their third-grade TAKS reading scores attest to that fact. 

 

The difference between the two districts is that Houston is further along on the cutting edge of reading instruction while Dallas is still clinging to antiquated whole-language practices. 

 

Perhaps Dr. Moses needs to give back some of his huge salary ($322,000 -- highest in the state and one of the highest in the nation) until Dallas ISD third-grade students match or surpass the state TAKS average of 89%.

Governor Bush,

As the discussion about the State Library continues, I wanted to
introduce a
new wrinkle for your consideration.

After speaking with President Wetherell, Dr. Gainous, and Dr. Law, I
learned
all three school libraries need renovation, more space and better
technology.  The schools already share subscriptions to many expensive
journals.  Research needs overlap.  In a survey done several years ago,
25%
of the students using the FSU library were from FAMU.

Using land on the Gaines St. corridor, adjacent to FSU, near to FAMU and
convenient to TCC, a "Monster" library could be built to accommodate the
needs of all three institutions.  The State Library archives and
collections
could be moved to this very publicly accessible facility.

In addition to providing an exciting innovative solution to pressing
needs,
this would empty a state building and provide long term cost
efficiencies.
This approach could help everyone win.

Thank you for your consideration.

Paula Smith

Dear Governor Bush:

President Ronald Reagan's speech announcing the "New Space Policy " at the fourth landing of Space Shuttle Columbia on the 4th of July, 1982 at Edwards Air Force Base, stated:

"Beginning with the next flight, the Space Shuttle will be fully operational and ready to provide economical and routine access to space for scientific exploration, commercial ventures, and tasks related to national security.  Simultaneously we must establish a more permanent presence in Space.   Our goals for space are ambitious, yet, achievable.  We've only peered over the edge of our  accomplishments."  

I believe that we can have a much greater "economical and routine system of access to space."  

Please note the proposal below for an affordable, reusable Orbital Space Plane (OSP) that will takeoff from an airport runway and return to a runway after its mission.  



"Confidential Information"





SPACE PLANE CONCEPT SPECIFICATIONS:

Order Year:  2003
Project type:  Spacecraft  
Estimated investment:  To be announced 
Completion:   2006
Sponsor:  NASA and/or Air Force 
Lead contractor:  America Aerospace, Inc.  
Dimensions    
Span:  7.9 m / 26.07 feet 
Maximum Speed:  Mach 4.5  
Maximum Altitude:  100 km / 62 miles 
Length:  13.7 m / 45.21 feet 
Take-Off Weight:  4500 kg / 9,900 pounds 
Engines:  2 x Williams-Rolls FJ44 and One Pratt & Whitney RL 10

Space Plane Concept

This Space Plane design shown is for a Sub-Orbital that takes off from an ordinary airport using turbofan engines and climbs at subsonic speed then the pilot starts the rocket engine and pulls up into a steep climb.  When the rocket fuel is used up climbing vertically at a speed of Mach 2.8 to a height of 62 miles/100 km coasting.  Then the Space Plane enters a steep dive to return and once reaching the atmosphere the pilot pulls out of the dive and flies back to the airport.  This can be modified and mature into an Orbital Space Plane version to place in orbit but is a low cost stepping stone to carry loads into space.

The Space Plane will carry two crew and two passengers ( or payload) to space and back.  Capable of taking off under its own power and of making several flights to space per day (NASA & Air Force will like flexibility).

Orbital Space Plane

The aerodynamics, structure, engines and systems are all based on existing technology (proven materials and existing engines).  The Space Plane will lead to a fully Orbital Space Plane.  The idea is to use existing technology and is perfect for launching small satellites, for taking replacement crews to and from the International Space Station (ISS).  

COST

The estimated cost for developing a fully Orbital Space Plane (larger than the concept presented) would be equivalent to about three Shuttle flights.   Three years to first flight.

ORBITAL SPACE PLANE (OSP)
  <http://www.slinews.com/images/techline.gif> 
Level 1 requirements 



Printer-friendly  <http://www.slinews.com/osp3a.html> version





Mission Needs Statement     NASA

The vehicle(s) and associated systems will support U.S. ISS requirements for crew rescue, crew transport, and cargo. 

Requirements 

1. The system, which may include multiple vehicles, shall provide rescue* capability for no fewer than four ISS crew as soon as practical but no later than 2010. 

2. The system shall provide rescue capability that allows the safe return of deconditioned, ill or injured crewmembers with ongoing treatment until arrival at definitive medical care within 24 hours. Crew should not require suits in the vehicle, but the vehicle should support crew wearing suits if the situation warrants. 

3. The system for rescue shall provide for rapid separation from the ISS under emergency conditions followed by return to Earth. 

4. Safety requirements - system for crew rescue: a. The availability (defined as "a full-up vehicle able to perform its mission") for the escape mission shall be at least: Objective: 99% Minimum Threshold: 95%. b. The risk of loss of crew shall be, with high confidence, lower than the Soyuz for the rescue mission. 

5. The system shall provide transportation capability for no fewer than four crew to and from the ISS as soon as practical but no later than 2012. 

6. Safety requirement - system for crew transport: The risk of loss of crew shall be, with high confidence, lower than the Space Shuttle for the transport mission. 

7. The system shall be designed for minimum life cycle cost. 

8. The system shall meet all applicable ISS requirements for visiting and attached vehicles. 

9. Compared to the Space Shuttle, the system shall require less time to prepare and execute a mission and have increased launch probability. 

10. Compared to the Space Shuttle, the system shall have increased on-orbit maneuverability. 

Operations Concepts 

1. The vehicle(s) shall initially launch on an ELV. 

2. The system shall be operated through at least 2020. However, the system should be designed so that it could be operated for a longer time. 

3. NASA envisions that the systems for crew rescue and crew transport could be different versions of the same vehicle design. 

4. The system shall provide contingency capability for cargo delivery to or from the ISS to support a minimal level of science. 

5. The system shall support a nominal ISS crew rotation period of 4-6 months. 

* Rescue includes medical evacuation and emergency evacuation.

Subject: Please do not allow the ERA to pass in Florida


Dear Governor Bush:


RE:  SB 1166 and HB 615 (ERA)
Please do not allow them to pass in Florida!




Here are but a few (among many) reasons why we oppose the proposed Equal Rights Amendment (ERA).

The women of Florida defeated the ERA in 1982, after fighting against in since 1972 when Congress sent it out to the states to ratify it.  I was one of those women, and we're tired of fighting against a spoiled group of women who continue to get their way in the legislature and the courts... it seems that the rest of the women who oppose the feminist views, can never win (where are our equal rights?), because no matter how many times we defeat this thing, they bring it back and no one questions the validity or legality of what they're doing!  The ERA died in 1982, and we need to leave it in the ground.  Throughout the 10 year period when we were fighting against this amendment, 5 states, who had ratified, wanted to rescind ratification, but the Federal Courts wouldn't allow it!  After the deadline passed, the US Supreme Court wouldn't even hear the case regarding the legality of rescission, because they said there was no point "the ERA was dead"!

The original ERA resolution which passed Congress on March 22, 1972 included the following preamble preceding the three sections of the text of ERA:

"Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of each House concurring therein), that the following article is proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven years from the date of its submission by Congress"

Here is the exact wording of the text:

"Section 1:  Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex. (Our note:  depending upon whether the word "sex" is used as a noun or a verb, the courts could interpret this to mean the sex you are, the sex you do, your sexual orientation)

Section 2:  The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.  (Our note:  We don't even know what the legal provisions will be... Since when do we allow an amendment to the Constitution, that the courts have to decide what interpretation to place what is meant by "equality of rights on account of sex".)

Section 3:  This Amendment shall take effect two years after the date of ratification."

Now we've been told that we need this amendment, because "we need to put women into the Constitution"  First of all, our Constitution is sex neutral... it alludes to "persons" which include both men and women.

-  Do you notice that this proposed amendment does not even mention women, does not mention women's rights or equal pay for equal work (as we've been told that this is what the ERA is about)?
-  Do you notice that these so-called "equal rights" will be based solely upon "sex"?
-  Do you realize that in a court of law, "sex" can be interpreted to mean "the sex you are, the sex you do, or your sexual preference?
-  It can also mean that any laws which only apply to one sex (such as abortion), will be considered illegal discrimination against the female sex, if these abortion laws are overturned.  It will be all over for pro-life legislation, and it won't matter of pro-life judges are appointed or not... if the ERA becomes an amendment to our US Constitution, abortion will be locked in probably beyond our great grandchildren's lifetime.
- If the courts interpret denial of "equality of rights on account of sex" to mean "sexual orientation, then we will see homosexual marriage, marital benefits and the adoption of children by homosexuals legalized and locked into our Constitution.  (Look up the NOW website, to see that they know that abortion and special gay rights are exactly the reason that they're pushing for the ERA... so that any gain they've had in this area (local, state or federal laws), cannot be overturned).  Also, I have a copy of excerpts from the 1973 Yale Law Journal, which show that ERA, will legalize all of the above special gay rights). We discriminate, deny, and abridge behavioral choices every day (murder, theft, pedophilia, rape, drugs, etc.). Homosexuality is a behavior, not a state of being.

-Further, if the draft is reinstated (as Cong. Charles Rengle) is trying to get passed, men and women will have to be drafted into combat, equally.  Congress has always had the power to draft women into combat, but could choose not to... Women could always choose to join the military... but if ERA is passed, there will be no choice!  We know SOME women are capable of the same physical strength, and emotional systems as men, but most of us aren't.  I would hate to know that the lives of my grandsons would have to depend on any of my granddaughters!!!!!!  Even Israel has 
exemptions for the women who fight in their military (marital status, religion and whether or not they have children).  Israeli military women also do not have to meet the same physical requirements and endurance as the men.  With ERA, there will be no exemptions!

I will be sending more info on this, at a later date, but this can get you started.  I hope you will get back with me, as I would like to discuss this issue with you in more detail.  Thank you for not supporting this dangerous amendment.  We already have most of these laws in place at local, state and federal levels... we do not need a constitutional amendment which is so ambiguous that we don't even know for sure what we'll be adding to our Constitution.  We cannot trust our judicial system to interpret law responsibly and accurately, today.  They're too busy creating law and misinterpreting our US Constitution.  We must defeat the ERA in Florida!  

Remember, when the ERA went down in Florida, in 1982, we had 5,000 registered, female, Florida voters at the Capitol that we had documented (who had fought ERA for 10 years, because Congress gave the ERA proponents a 3 year extension). This number of 5,000 only verified those women who came by Greyhound bus, it did not include those of us who had driven and brought 3 others with us, or those of us who had flown up.  No matter what the media said, the ERA propononets had roughly 500 women there.  Their women knocked our elderly women to the ground, stomped on the feet of our women grinding their heels, and I personally got the wind knocked out of me.  We also took pictures of the out of state tags of ERA proponents (Norman Lear had given them $3 million to push this through).  Our women had to scrimp and save out of our household money to accomplish what we did!  Please do not allow this to pass in Florida.

I have much more information for you on this matter.  If you care to discuss, I can be reached by my e-mail (chamoistru@aol.com), or by phone (352) 369-0594.  Please feel free to contact me... I look forward to hearing from you.

Importance:	High

Office of Insurance Regulation
 
 
Activities Report 
 
 
Week of March 24, 2003 – March 28, 2003
 
Emerging Issues:
 
The Applications Coordination Section of the Office of Insurance Regulation is reporting that the inventory of pending applications for companies requesting admission into the State of Florida is the lowest that it has ever been.  The drop in pending applications is due to shortening of processing time.  The staff has been tasked with a sixty (60) day review goal.  
 
Red Mountain Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Pro National Insurance Company, was granted eligibility as a surplus lines insurer.  They will begin writing medical malpractice coverage in Florida. 
 
Humana, Inc. (HMO) requested payment of a $45 million dividend.  The payment of this dividend is scheduled for March 31, 2003.  The company has approximately $134 million in surplus before the dividend distribution.  The Office has requested delaying the distribution until clarification on their reserves is received.  
 
The Office of Insurance Regulation filed a contempt action against Superior Insurance Company with Judge Ferris’s office on Friday , March 21, 2003, for failure to comply with the October 2002 Circuit Court Order requiring repayment of monies that were wrongfully paid to the holding company.  The Department of Insurance issued a final order directing Superior to cease the payment of certain monies to the holding company.  Superior did not comply with this consent order.  An examination of this company by OIR is ongoing. 
 
P.C.A. Insurance Company has applied for reinstatement of its license and intends to write workers compensation coverage for PEO’s (employee leasing companies).   An evidentiary hearing was held last week and OIR is now ready to approve this application.  P.C.A. will write large deductible policies and require significant contributions from the potential PEO insureds.
 
PhyTrust is proposing to form an HMO in Florida.  This company is an MSO (Medical Service Organization) in Sunrise, Florida that is run by Dr. Neil Natkow.  This company currently contracts with Humana and Vista South Florida.  This company, once licensed, will write Medicaid only business but may pursue commercial business in the future.  The proposed HMO will be affiliated with Charleston Partners, a Florida licensed third party administrator.
 
Access Basic Care, Inc. (d/b/a Care Access) is planning to file an application for licensure as a prepaid health clinic.  This entity will offer basic health services.  The principal of the company is Frank Ditchart and they are based in North Miami.  The company is discussing partnering with a major medical indemnity carrier.  They are affiliated with HS1 Medical Management, Inc., a Florida licensed third party administrator.
 
Atlantic Preferred is assuming approximately 28,000 policies from Citizens as part of a takeout plan that was previously approved by the Office of Insurance Regulation.  The assumption is effective July 1, 2003.
 
Rule Hearings:  
 
A rule hearing regarding Rule 4-149.0025, Part III (Small Employer Health Care Access:  Definitions) is scheduled for May 13, 2003 in the Cabinet Meeting Room at 9:00 a.m.  This is to implement legislative changes and move definition section of the rule.
 
Legal Orders Issued:
 
An Immediate Final Order against the following companies was executed on March 25, 2003:  Unimed, Professional Liability Insurance Company, Ltd. (PLIC), PLIC Claims Management, Inc., Medical Risk Associates, R.P.G., Inc., Medical Risk Associates, R.P.G., Ltd., Physicians Malpractice Analysts, Inc., Mishima Murasaki, James E. Reynolds, Brooke C. Harris, Matt Reed, and Jerline Ann Cascio, for operating as an unauthorized insurer.  The persons named are operatives in the organization, employees of UNIMED (acting as a broker), and one Florida agent, Jerline Ann Cascio.  The entities and individuals that are engaging in the unauthorized transaction of insurance by aiding and representing PLIC are committing third degree felonies.  The executed Immediate Final Order finds that, despite being unlicensed, the entities transacted property and casualty insurance business in Florida by soliciting and selling medical malpractice coverage.  PLIC is an offshore entity listing an address in Bermuda.  Our research determined that PLIC is not registered with the Bermuda Monetary Authority and we have no evidence that PLIC is authorized to transact insurance anywhere.  
 
A Consent Order was executed against Seminole Casualty Insurance Company on March 25, 2003.  This consent order is a due to a market conduct examination.  As a result of the examination report, the Office determined that the insurer failed to comply with premium finance cancellation requirements, failed to comply with unfair trade practice requirements, failed to provide timely notice of renewal, non-renewal or cancellation, failed to develop a privacy plan, failed to comply with return of unearned premium requirements, failed to properly adjust claim per policy requirements, and failed to provide safety device discounts.  
 
A Consent Order was executed against Health Plan Southeast, Inc. on March 25, 2003.  Health Plan Southeast, Inc. is a health maintenance organization authorized to transact business in the State.  A target market examination was conducted where the Office determined that Health Plan Southeast, Inc. failed to pay interest on late paid claims, failed to adopt and implement standards for proper investigation of PIP claims, and failed to properly process interest.  Health Plan Southeast shall undertake corrective action to establish and implement procedures to assure that all claims are processed in a timely fashion and make certain that all claims by providers are properly coordinated with other insurers and/or self-insurers.  Health Plan Southeast shall submit for the Office’s review a revision to its policies and procedures regarding claims payments and proper coordination of benefits no later than thirty (30) days.
 
A Consent Order was executed with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida, Inc. on March 25, 2003 to extend the permitted practice for goodwill accounting to March 15, 2005.
 
A Consent Order was executed against G.E. Life and Annuity Assurance Company on March 25, 2003.  An investigation was performed by the Office on this Virginia domestic life insurance company.  As a result of that investigation, it was determined that the company had on numerous occasions failed to include interest on the payment of cash surrender values processed after thirty (30) days from the date of the request in violation of Section 627.482, Florida Statutes.  This Consent Order requires the company to pay the interest not previously paid and to implement procedures for the payment of interest in the future.

Governor,
 
We are planning an “appreciation day” in Tallahassee, which will give parents with children on the tax credit scholarships a chance to show their thanks to you and the legislature for making this vital program possible. The date is April 24th. We hope to have between 600 and 800 people, primarily minority parents and children. The event will be held on the steps of the old capitol. Already committed to speak is Dr. N.S. Sanders, President, Progressive Missionary and Educational Baptist State Convention of Florida, and Pastor of Greater St. Paul Church and Academy in Lakeland. Also speaking will be Ms. Pinkie Hendley, who runs two excellent schools serving many children on all three of the parent choice programs. We will also have two parents speak about how the program has changed their children’s lives. 
 
We would be most honored if you were to appear and allow these parents to thank you for your tremendous help, and perhaps say a few words. The program is scheduled to run from about 11:00am to 11:30am.
 
Thank you for considering this request. I hope all is well with you.
 
Sincerely,
 
John Kirtley

Subject:	RE: Wrongful Termination of Ana Maria Piazza

Sorry my system crashed before I could send the information.  My name is Ana 
Maria Piazza, as you know my mother and father (Ken and Ana Davey) have kept 
you abreast of the situation with Standard Insurance.  They finally 
responded to my good faith letter however it was not a favorable response.  
I have retained Steven G. Wenzel Labor & Employment Law Attorney to give me 
some guidance with this issue.  I received correspondence from Ms. Gayle 
Evans and her conclusions are in correct and documentation that was provided 
was not to its full detail. Only bits and pieces were attached to lead this 
investigation to a wrong conclusion.  She failed to show all documentation 
of the situation that had taken place last year when I had to contact home 
office on the unethical ways of the Tampa Group Office. She also failed to 
speak to any neutral employees that were not within the inner circle. There 
were several months of documentation to the home office of which I reported 
many issues to Debi Barnes at Human Resources.   The letter clearly was bias 
and intimidating to say the least.  They now want to offer me a 2nd 
separation package which includes and agreement for Standard not to contest 
unemployment claim.  However the separation agreement comes with many 
releases and stipulations not to converse with anyone about Standard 
Insurance Company.  My main objective here was to get my employment back 
nothing less nothing more.  To this date I'm not sure how the outcome will 
be. I am hopeful that I can legally seek my employment back, but at this 
time it may be bleak.  For I am an individual with limited income.  What 
makes my endeavor to continue is for the truth to prevail and the dishonesty 
stop.

Respectfully yours and with sincere graditude,

Ana Maria Piazza

Governor Jeb Bush

As a member of a local Florida organization of Jupiter Business and Professional Women and a Republican as well I was dismayed at your remarks regarding the ERA .  Surely you know that most women and men support equality among all.  

Women certainly do not have equal pay for equal work.  Next month on April 15th will be the day that women's wages will match those of her counterpart males from the previous year of 2002.

That is one of the reasons that the ERA comes up every year and will until its passage.  Surely you would want equality for your wife, daughters and granddaughters.

In this time when over 250,000 women are serving in the armed services right along  with our servicemen, your support on this issue should  be spontaneous and decisive for passage.

You need to apologize to the women of this state who encompass over 50% of the voting public.

Sincerely,
 
Margaret A. Sutton

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I am writing you regarding an extremely important upcoming cultural event that will take place in Daytona Beach on 
April 25, 2003.  My wife Forough has already written to you about the gala , "A Breeze From Gardens of Persia" taking place at the Museum of Arts and Sciences at 7:00 P.M.  I think it is a great idea for you to attend as it is a public event where many of your major supporters from this area and from your finance committee will be there since they have sponsored this event.  It would really be marvelous if you could spare the time and I would love to see you and Mrs. Bush there.  
 
I know how very busy your schedule is.  If there is anything I can do to assist you in joining us, please do not hesitate to contact me.  I will be more than happy to send my plane to pick up you.   
 
Looking forward to hearing from you,
 
Mori Hosseini

Governor,

we have been working on USDOT for a $10M grant for iFlorida---an FDOT high tech project.  Stephanie believes that the announcement might occur  Tuesday, 4/1.  We were in competition w/ Missiouri and have been worried since Sen Kit Bond is in a very tight situation for his next re-elect.  We have been working to make sure that the decision in on substance and not politics.

Mineta's DCOS called Steph...Sec Mineta would like to speak w/ you Monday morning for about 10 minutes.  Can we try to make this work?  We'll give him Alan Florez's cell.  OK?  Thanks, Nina  (I'll be in and out all weekend---home 703/556-6917; cell 202/494-3202).

Subject:	River Oaks Assisted Living, Crystal River

My mother has been a resident of River Oaks since October 1997.  As I live close, I spend time with her at least once or twice weekly.  She is ambulatory, but does require a secure environment; therefore, the time I spend there is also spent with those patients who have the most severe dementia.  At no time have I witnessed any mistreatment.  

Doors to rooms are locked to protect privacy.  Surely even the dimmest bulb understands that you cannot reason with the mentally challenged; you have to remove the temptation.

As I am often there before lunchtime, the registered nurse is passing out the mineral, vitamin, and fish oil cocktail (maybe 2 tablespoons)?  I'm sure if I requested that my mother not be included, that would be fine with the staff.  If it did not help, it surely can't hurt, so what is the big deal here?

The issue of restraints;   I have never witnessed anyone with any restraint other that the gait belts that are designed as an aid in walking and sitting.

I am particularly disturbed to find out this morning that the state has arbitrarily taken it upon themselves to remove 12 patients.  Is this really to protect the patients rights?  I think what we have here is a vendetta that has gotten out of hand, and the very people the state professes to protect are the ones who have the most to lose.  Do the families (those who REALLY care what happens to their loved ones) have no say?

Does the state examine the other facilities in Florida with the same diligence?   

In closing, I can only tell you that my mother has been very happy at River Oaks, and her family feel very fortunate to have chosen this particular place for her final years.

Subject:	Some Collier board members disappointed with superintendent candidates

In Lee County, our school board promoted a top notch principal with 31 years of successful experience in the district in a variety of school based & district positions.  He's Dr. Jim Browder and he has spent his career living by the motto that all decisions have to be based on what's best for kids.  
 
He's only two weeks on the job.  However, many have confidence that his strong, steady, common sense approach along with his dedication to the community he's been part of for three decades will combine to provide a terrific superintendent.
 
There has been little negative fall out in the community because of the school board's choice of Dr. Browder because so many know and trust him.  
 
In contrast, Collier's school board has hired yet another consulting company to find their superintendent and many seem skeptical about the quality of the selections.  I hope the board doesn't rush into a choice they may regret in the future.  
 
I wish all the best to Collier County.  They are great neighbors and deserve a terrific school superintendent to lead their public education system.  
 
All school districts should work to develop competencies in district employees which will allow a choice of local contenders when it becomes necessary to replace their superintendent.  They should also be conservative in developing contracts to assure fairness to the community when the superintendent leaves.
 
More on the search for a superintendent in Collier...

Some board members disappointed with superintendent candidates 

http://www.naplesnews.com/03/03/naples/d926605a.htm


Saturday, March 29, 2003 


By RAY PARKER, brparker@naplesnews.com 




Benjamin Marlin, an educator not from Florida but familiar with the state, is the third candidate competing to become the next school superintendent of Collier County. 


The former Palm Beach County superintendent, whose name was revealed Friday afternoon, will join educator Vickie Markavitch and businessman Jeffrey Friedel in the first round of interviews today. 


But even before the candidates arrive in Naples, some Collier County School Board members were upset with the process. 


"I'm disappointed at the quality of candidates and I wanted to know more about who was eliminated and why," board Chairwoman Linda Abbott said Friday. 


During Thursday's workshop, consultant William Attea presented the board with two names, Markavitch and Friedel, and said another candidate, who turned out to be Marlin, would be forthcoming. 


That's not what board member Steve Donovan expected. 


"I expected a higher caliber of applicants or more of them," he said. 



  <http://www.naplesnews.com/graphics/1x1.gif> 	
AT A GLANCE

Today's interviews will be held at the Administrative Center, 5775 Osceola Trail, and are open to the public. The schedule will be: 12:12-2:15 p.m. board interviews Markavitch; 2:30-4:30 p.m. interviews Marlin; 4:45-6:45 p.m. interviews Friedel; and begins deliberations at 7 p.m. 
  <http://www.naplesnews.com/graphics/1x1.gif> 


But board members Pat Carroll and Dick Bruce noted judging someone on paper can't measure up with interviewing that person. 

"I trust Dr. Attea (on these candidates)," Carroll said of the president of the search firm, Hazard, Young, Attea & Associates. 


Board member Kathleen Curatolo defended the job the search firm has done so far for the district. 


"I think Attea is doing a great job in guiding us through the process," she said. 


Of the three candidates, local education activists are already questioning Markavitch's background. 


During Thursday's workshop, Joy Jirik asked Attea about his relationship with Markavitch. 


In the mid-1990s, both Attea and Markavitch were superintendents in neighboring districts in Illinois. 


But Attea said his relationship with her was just professional, and that he may have seen her in the last eight years or so, but that they are not close friends. 


"Absolutely not true," he said of their past having any influence on his presenting her to the board. 


Markavitch began as a special education teacher in 1969, and she then spent the next 32 years rising up the educational chain at various districts in Michigan and Illinois. 


She held the top job in both Skokie School District 73½ and Niles Township District 219, which are both located in Skokie, Ill. 


In 1998, she left Niles Township with at least $74,000 in additional retirement benefits that were not included in her employment contract, according to a published report in the Skokie Review. 


The newspaper reported that board member Sharon Deemar said, "To be honest, I kind of felt we were held hostage." She did not elaborate. 


Markavitch has been a superintendent finalist recently in at least two other districts, in Grand Rapids, Mich., and Salt Lake City, Utah. 


The Salt Lake Tribune newspaper reported Markavitch withdrew her name from running the 24,300-student district because of a "a low salary package." 


For the past five years, she's headed the Penn-Harris-Madison School Corp., a district with more than 10,000 students. 


Markavitch was unavailable for comment Friday. 


Friedel of Baltimore has a nontraditional background with experience in the military and business worlds. He has worked to improve various districts through a private company called 4GL School Solutions in Baltimore. 


Marlin is a retired administrator who worked nearly 30 years in the Montgomery County Public Schools in Rockville, Md. He ended his career there as an assistant superintendent and became the interim superintendent for 18 months in Palm Beach County. It's the 14th largest district in the nation with more than 150,000 students. 


Today's interviews will be held at the Administrative Center, 5775 Osceola Trail, and are open to the public. The schedule will be: 12:12-2:15 p.m. board interviews Markavitch; 2:30-4:30 p.m. interviews Marlin; 4:45-6:45 p.m. interviews Friedel; and begins deliberations at 7 p.m.

Hello Governor Bush:
I hope that you are doing well and are staying safe. When you went to
The
Ground Breaking For The New Call Center in Pensacola Florida, did you
happen
to get the names of the people who will be opening the center?
The reason that I ask, is that there a great many blind people who live
in
that area who need jobs. I want to find out what applications the call
center will be using so that I would know if the applications are
compatible
with the software that is designed for blind people.

If blind people get and keep jobs it would help to stimulate FLORIDA'S
ECONOMY.
So, if you could find out the name of the people who will be running the
call center it would help a great deal.

Florida Association of the Deaf, Inc. (FAD)

March 29, 2003

FAD President Hardy's Report:

Dear FAD Board of Directors:

I am looking back and I had a great ride for the last four years. I am
now signing the swan song because this coming June will be my last term
as president. My term ends in June 14, 2003.

What has FAD accomplished in the last past four years while I was 
president?

FAD have established a FAD-L statewide alert mailing list and community
updates also Deaf related news. FAD also created a web site 
http://www.fladeaf.org and http://www.floridadeaf.org.

FAD members appointed by Governor Jeb Bush to statewide advocacy
positions (Florida Independent Living Council, Inc. (FILC) and
Americans with Disabilities Working Group (ADAWG)).

FAD represented the Deaf and hard of hearing citizens at the statewide
Vocational Rehabilitation (VR), Florida Independent Living Council 
(FILC), Grassroots Forum 2000 and 2002, Partners in Policy making of 
Developmental Disabilities Council (DD), Americans with Disabilities Act 
Working Group Conference and meetings (ADAWG), Department of Education 
(DOE), Florida Public Service Commission TASA Advisory Board, FTRI 
Training Conference, and Federal Communications Commission meetings (FCC).

FAD also represented at the National Association of the Deaf, Inc. (NAD) 
State Association Conferences, NAD's Regional Conferences, NAD National 
Conferences, Registry Interpreters of the Deaf Conferences (RID) and
Florida Registry Interpreters of the Deaf Conference (FRID).

FAD was also represented when Registry Interpreters of the Deaf, Inc. 
(RID) and NAD had their Interpreting Task Force in Clearwater, FL, and 
Jr. NAD Conference in Dundee, FL..

FAD Filed complaint with FCC when Hurricane Floyd did not have closed
captioning television emergency broadcast in Florida. It is now a 
federal law that all emergency broadcasts must be closed captioned.

FAD has filed numerous ADA complaints with the Department of Justice 
(DOJ) and Federal Communication Commission (FCC).

FAD has assisted over 20,000 Deaf and hard of hearing people of Florida
with advocacy, legal, and civil rights issues.

FAD has written over 4,000 letters to government agencies.

FAD has assisted over 2,100 referrals with questions on education, law,
health, and hearing loss issues.

FAD has traveled over 100,000 miles for advocacy, Deaf club visits, and
presentations.

FAD has helped with getting Turbo Code, Caller-ID and pushed for
wireless issues with the Florida Public Service Commission TASA Advisory 
Board (FPSC TASA).

FAD has been involved with the National Association of the Deaf
Technology Advocacy Network Committee (NAD-TAN).

FAD has been involved with the implementation of the Florida Commission
on Deafness. The Bills are SB2244 and HB 1345 are now pending in the
Florida House and Senate.

FAD has personally met the governor and many other legislators to
educate issues on Deafness.

As I have made my campaign platform prior to running for FAD President
and I stressed that I would be doing a lot of advocacy work and
educating the legislators on Deafness. I also mentioned that I will
establish a statewide communication e-mail system for FAD members. I
have met all of my goals and obligations as a FAD President.

My work is done and the next FAD President will have their own goals and 
mission for the Florida Association of the Deaf, Inc. (FAD).

I wanted to thank my best friend, mother or our children, lover, and
much more, Constance "Connie." Connie has been my strength, advisor,
safety net, emotional supporter, cheerleader and most of all, Connie is
my personal hero because she supported 100% of what I have done for FAD.
There are so many times when I am down and tired but Connie pulled me
out and gave me strength to go on. Thank you, Connie for making FAD for
what it is today!

I wanted to thank many of you for your support, encouragement,
friendship over the years and I will always cherish those wonderful
memories.

I have one request before I close this letter, please, give the same
support that you all gave me to the next president and help that
president carry out the tradition, duties and obligations. Being a
FAD President is a very hard and demanding job. It takes passion,
motivation, and strength to serve the Deaf and hard of hearing 
population. Being a FAD President is the highest calling.

Thank you for letting me have the greatest experience of a lifetime
and I love each one of you!


FADically yours,


Stephen Joseph Hardy, II
President
Florida Association of the Deaf, Inc.

Subject:	Florida Humanities Council and The Florida Center for Teachers.

Dear Governor Bush,

	For over two years I have agonized at how I could possibly communicate 
with you concerning the loss of funding for The Florida Center for 
Teachers. I am a retired elementary school teacher and have been a 
board member of the Florida Humanities Council for the past three 
years. I have been Teacher of the Year twice, Social Studies Teacher of 
the Year for Escambia County and Global Educator of the year for 
Florida in 1998. I have spoken to several of our mutual friends in 
Tallahassee and Pensacola and they have told me that you actually do 
read your emails. I have decided to take a chance and just sit down and 
pretend I was face to face with you and tell you what has been on my 
heart. 	You should know that I am a Republican, and am not a member of 
the Teachers' Union. I blame them and their hypocrisy for many of our 
problems in education now. They hocked their building and sold their 
souls to support McBride and the Small Class Amendment.  My 
grandfather, J. Tom Watson was the Attorney General in Florida from 
1940-1948  and was the first serious Republican candidate for governor. 
He was responsible for the Right to Work Amendment to the Florida 
Constitution. He ran against LeRoy Collins for Governor in 1954 but 
died three days before the election. My husband Roger is the Chief 
Judge of the Northern District of Florida and was a first term Reagan 
appointee.  I consider myself part of your team in most matters.
	Five years ago, I  was chosen to attend an archaeology seminar 
sponsored by the Florida Center for Teachers and the Florida Humanities 
Council. It was a life changing experience for me and the material I 
shared with my 4th Grade students was so relevant to our Florida 
History studies. Because of its richness of content and the chance to 
interact with Florida's best teachers and scholars, it was unlike any 
district professional development seminar I have attended in the past. 
Since then, I have attended two others summer seminars. Without 
exception, they were the best inservice experiences I've ever had. The 
30 hours of credit I received for each seminar helped me renew my 
teaching certificate for 5 more years.
	After,your first veto of our $275,000 legislative appropriation, we 
really tightened our belt. We changed residential locations from 
downtown St Petersburg to Eckerd College. We cut back on staff and 
mailing costs. We offered only the most popular programs with the 
teachers and didn't try to develop any new ones. We looked everywhere 
for private funding and contributions from school districts from their 
Professional Development Funds. By begging our school board, I have 
been able to get $5,000 for our five Teacher of the Year Finalists to 
attend the summer seminar of their choice. Very few other school 
districts have been able to contribute, especially in the smaller 
counties. I  believed that your first veto was as oversight on your 
part. Someone must be giving you bad advice and that surely we'd get 
back in the Legislative Budget the next year without another veto. 
Needless to say, I was very sad when you vetoed the Legislative 
appropriation the second year.
	Now we have a new problem. With two vetos and a critical budget 
shortfall, legislators don't want to put us back in the budget without 
some assurance that you'll at least consider us this year. We've 
learned that funding from Cultural and Community Assistant Grants and 
the Cultural Institutions Trust Fund is threatened. With those grants 
gone or diminished, many of our programs will surely wither and die.
	I visited Dr. Stanley Marshall several months ago in Tallahassee and 
shared my concerns about the Florida Center for Teachers. I convinced 
the Humanities Council to cosponsor a History Seminar  on "Heroism" 
with the James Madison Institute. I made a commitment to lead a summer 
2004 seminar on "Teaching The Bill of Rights in the Elementary 
Classroom." I have already done this in Escambia County. This supports 
the NEH "We the People" initiative on teaching American History from 
President Bush and Bruce Cole. I believe that there can be a symbiotic 
relationship between the Florida Center for Teachers and your education 
plan for Florida. We should be able to provide a product that offers 
statewide teacher reward, retention and professional development that 
supports your program. Your support of our program would help dispel 
the notion that you are "anti-education."  Key legislators would 
certainly put us back in their budget with the idea that you recognized 
the value of The Florida Center for Teachers. So many liberals have the 
idea that if you're a Republican, you can't possibly have any interest 
or knowledge in Art and Culture. I will admit that our board is a 
little top heavy with these kind of thinkers. In spite of this, I have 
never worked with a group of people so dedicated to sharing Florida's 
cultural, literary, and artistic heritage as the staff and board 
members of the Florida Humanities Council. In these troubling times, I 
can not imagine life without these kinds of programs. Won't you please 
consider supporting us this year? I give you my word that I will do 
everything I can to make The Florida Center for Teachers the best 
professional development resource for teachers in the country.  l look 
forward to your response.
Sincerely,
Ellen W. Vinson

Subject: Roundtable discussions on medical malpractice and property rights


Dear Governor Bush:

I noticed that you will be touring parts of Florida in order to have a round table discussion on medical malpractice costs.  Any chance that you could make a stop in the Tampa area for the same discussion?  

My husband is an ER physician at Morton Plant Hospital in Clearwater and during his career has experienced the rising increase of malpractice insurance along with decreasing dollars of third party payers.  Although he loves the "medicine" part, it  makes it difficult for him to practice medicine in the litigious environment that we currently live in.    Its not unrealistic to say that new doctors going into practice have well over exceeded $200,000 in medical school loans and depending on the area of medicine that person is going into with the malpractice insurance, decrease in third party payers, office overhead, you can see that there isn't much left.  

Where am I going with this? We bought our house for a view of the water and at the end of the day when my husband comes home from a hard shift, he deserves to be able to look out at the bay - our house is 300ft. from the bay, yet we can't see it!

I know that you have assigned this case on mangroves to Denver Stutler, and he is working of it, but I felt it necessary to communicate with you.

I just wanted to tell you how happy I was to be able to attend the Family Literacy event last night.

The program was absolutely incredible and the testimony that Laura gave was extremely powerful and touching.

I am so pleased that this program exists throughout the state as it truly changes lives.

Florida is lucky to have you.

Very truly yours,
Nick Kalman

To whom it concerns:
 
My Grandmother, Greba Scott has been at River Oaks for about 6 years now, with my Mother nearby to visit her regularly.  I am appalled at the accuasations of "mistreatment" by utilizing straps to keep patients from harm.  My Grandmother would also be considered what one in the article referred to as halfway.  She is very mobile and therefore needs to be in a secured area to keep her from wandering off.  This does not mean she needs to be moved to a full fledged nursing home where I fear she would not get the attention, and interaction that she still requires to remain active, alert and healthy.  To shut down a facility that so obviously cares about what is best for their patients would be neglectful of the courts, and to try to do so on such short notice is just plain wrong!  Don't they realize the trauma that, that would cause these patients and there families?  I just visited there with my Mother a few weeks ago, and my Grandmother is doing quite well.  That being said of course I saw all the other patients and not only were they fine, they were treated kindly and compassionately in a clean safe environment.

Dear Governor,

I would be totally remiss if I didn't reach out and ask if there is a remote possibility that you might honor us with your presence on May 29th. We have been aggressively building a "Who's Who" list of South Florida Governmental and Business leaders for the past 90 hours. This will be the first time that all the Major Mayors of Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach County have gathered for a single minded purpose. THE WINNING OF THE FTAA BID FOR SOUTH FLORIDA. It took 2 months of deep under surface work, But I am proud to announce that it was accomplished this week. 
Now, is there anyway that we can get real lucky and:
1) Your calendar is clear, and
2) You would love to be a part of regional history.

By the time I get through building this list of regional leaders, it will literally read like a "South Florida Who's Who" of international Business. Take a peek below and excuse this out of protocol approach, but I know you are a hands on/no nonsense leader. I pray all is well, and share the pride that millions of America's have for the leadership that your Brother is giving to our state and nation. The details are below. We would also be honored to add your name to our leadership.  Aloha, Randy

As we in the South Florida Business community reach out to find new ways to help create a better regional economic picture for our 5 million + citizens, we are taking a first step. On May 29th, many South Florida chambers, economic development organizations, community leaders, and public officials will take a progressive step forward to help unify our region to help bring the FTAA Secretariat to South Florida. 

The International Business Council of South Florida, with full cooperation of Enterprise Florida, will host an "Evening with International Leaders" and, we need your involvement. The event will be a business international gathering, short on speeches, and strong on consensus building. We will recognize an Outstanding International Business leader in Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties. We will also honor Michael Langley for his community leadership, and name "An Outstanding Florida International Business Leader".
We are pleased that Enterprise Florida President/CEO Darrell Kelley, port and airport officials, International State, and national business leaders, tri county political leaders, and other respected community leaders have confirmed their involvement.
We will update the VIP list each week to show the success of this unity effort.
The FTAA Secretariat will bring thousands of new jobs, hundreds of millions of dollars in trade and commerce to the region, and base the Ministers of all 34 nations from our Hemisphere, here in South Florida.  

Please reply that you are interested in being involved. This event will be business attire with a gourmet meal, and provide a solid opportunity to meet other regional business leaders. It will also send a statement to the other 33 nations that South Florida speaks as one in our bid to host the Secretariat.  

Sincerely, Randy

A few days ago I read that giving 10% of one's income to church or charity will trigger an IRS audit.  It's hard to believe a "Christian" nation would discriminate and so blatantly target Christians.

I think it's absolutely pathetic and since your so close to the power source, I thought I'd pass the information along.  I will have some hefty giving to do this year and we'll see what happens.  If I get audited, I'll let you know.

Dear Governor Bush:

 

In today’s newspaper an article reported that Palmer Ranch, Palmer Holdings and Mr. Culverhouse have requested that you and the cabinet intercede on a decision made by the Sarasota Board of County Commissioners regarding the rezoning of two properties currently zoned residential.  The county commission did not deny the request—they merely postponed making a decision in the face of virulent opposition from Palmer Ranch residents, who established the need for further studies and gathering of pertinent information.  I see this move on the part of Palmer Ranch Holdings as an attempt at circumventing the quasi-judicial process by which such decisions should be made.  

Please do not grant their request!  Our local government is quite capable of handling this matter properly!    

Please gather all the facts prior to making any decision.  Let the people be heard as there are many of us (over three thousand who live in Palmer Ranch) this rezoning.  The people of Palmer Ranch do not want the properties rezoned for the many and varied reasons stated at the county commission hearings on March 19th.  

Again, please do not summarily grant any request concerning this matter until all the facts have been presented.

Hello Jeb,

You asked where we are living now and the answer is North Carolina.  Our
grandson, 12, the one we adopted, needed a different school situation than
the one in St. Johns County.  In North Carolina's Macon County they have a
program called Focus.  It is not Special Ed.  It is managed by a teacher and
the Smoky Mt. Mental Health people.  It saves kids who are bright but suffer
from depression or some other problem.  They nurture these kids back to
normalcy.  Ryan was doing well in St. Johns County academically.  In fact,
Duke was monitoring him for his math skills.  Made high scores on Florida
tests.  But he came unglued one day when the principal, against the doctor's
written orders, picked Ryan up and slung him on his hip and walked down the
hall with him in front of all the kids to his office.  Ryan was previously
diagnosed as being bipolar and was on medications. All this was in the
school records. He had bad experiences early in his life with physical
abuse.  He resisted this principal and became very upset and angry when he
was picked up like that.  Actually, the principal was hit on the ear on the
side of his body that the principal was carrying Ryan. ( Ryan is under 5
feet and weighed 75 pounds at the time) The doctor had advised that in these
situations Ryan be left alone for a few minutes. The principal did not want
to do that; said Ryan might run away.  So, the upshot of all this was they
wanted Ryan to go to a Discipline School for the rest of the year- a place
guarded by deputies and very demeaning.  They said if we did not do this and
sought our own solution (private school or homeschooling) that Ryan could
not get back to public school for 2 years
.
Andy, my husband and Ryan's grandfather, has Parkinsons Disease.  Later
stages.  (You and I had discussed this in letters back and forth email.)  We
talked with all doctors involved and with our minister.  It was unanimous
that is would be extremely harmful to Ryan to be in Gaines Discipline
Center. Ryan did not have a folder full of discipline referrals.  In fact, I
had many meetings with teachers and supplied the school with books on
children's depression.  We were all working together, I thought.  In fact,
the principal said I had been very helpful.  Suddenly we were "on the other
side".  We hired an attorney in Jacksonville to represent us at the hearing.
They school board stuck with their opinion. We found ourselves in a crisis
situation.  Our minister suggested we hire an educational professional to
test Ryan.  She said  he was suffering from post traumatic stress syndrome.
The event in St. Johns set Ryan back tremendously.  He was suddenly cut off
from his school, his friends, his band and math teachers-some neat teachers
who had connected with him. This is just the opposite response a kid
suffering from depression needs.

About me- I am a native Floridian and my ties go way back in Manatee County.
My good friend is George Harrison, a friend of yours, I believe.  When my
mother died in Bradenton a few years ago, George helped me a lot.  He showed
me a golf bag signed by your Dad, I think it was, in his office. We often
spoke of you and George and your endeavors. I am not out there on the fringe
just because I don't like the United Nations and their plans for our
country.  I have a great concern for what happens in this country. It seems
unfair that all this happened to us but we will continue on in another
place.

I am a Republican still and will always be proud of you and your brother.  I
watched you today at the Tampa rally. I am telling you that I still care
about Florida. My Republican friends in Duval and St. Johns were very
supportive of our move because they knew Ryan was not a punk kid who needed
a punitive situation.  We have had some very sad days but Jesus has been who
He says He is-sovereign, loving and merciful.  He is full of grace and
offers us hope for the future. We just have to remember that when the future
seems hopeless. It is not.

It is my hope that someday I can offer some suggestions to you, if you want
them, about how special kids who suffer from depression should or could be
treated in Florida. The ridiculous class size issue might take all the
funding and then some.  So maybe it will never be possible to make these
suggestions. Real issues are sometimes passed over by the electorate for
ridiculous reasons and class size is one example.

An update on Ryan- we came to a place that, to use your Dad's words, is
"kinder and gentler" than the community we were in.  A second opinion by an
Asheville child psychiatrist has Ryan on meds for anxiety and fear.  He is
off all bipolar medications.  His grades are excellent and we only have to
sell our house in St. Johns now to have the funds to start again up here.

We have to see people as individuals and not numbers.  I have always been a
rule-follower and expect kids to show respect. This was a crisis that should
not have happened and with just a little thought could have been avoided.
Our psychiatrist in Jacksonville pleaded with me to contact you at the time
but I did not.  It is not your problem to solve an individual's problems.
But it brought us to our knees.  The way this little North Carolina town
responded to us was an answer to prayer.  Their way of treating depression
in kids is an example other states could follow.

Enough about us.

You have such a huge job to do every day.  I will follow your efforts and
decisions to make Florida greater in every respect. I will support those
Republicans who support and defend our Constitution.  So, that means you.

I know you didn't ask for such a long response.  I won't be writing to you
as much though so don't worry.

Guess you see now how the United Nations supported us.  They didn't.  Hope
we will keep the governing of our nation in the hands of our republic and
not some outside body.  What a tremendous job George is doing.  I saw, I
thought, tears on his face when he finished his speech today. Seemed like he
quickly turned away from the camera.  I thought he was full of emotion as
was I.

You will be in my thoughts, Jeb. Thank you for answering my mail.

Subject: UCF Master Plan/ NW conservation land


Dear Gov. Bush:
 
    I wanted to take a moment to let you know that noteworthy opposition to the recently approved UCF Master Plan is growing among citizens and organizations here (even in other states, it seems!), largely due to the gross environmental degradation and procedural "irregularities" implementation of the Plan would entail.
     As cited to you a couple of months back, before the Board of Trustees had yet voted for approval, of special concern to ME (and many) is the planned destruction of the pristine sandhill scrub and pine flatwoods ecosystems in the Northwest quadrant.  This was originally designated as a preserve---and has always been called "The Preserve"---and was done in mitigation for other lands being developed on campus.  With that designation, Fish & Wildlife allowed gopher tortoises to be relocated there as their permanent home.  It should only be for a human life or death reason, in my opinion, that the status of this conservation area be violated. By all legal and ethical logic, its boundaries should be secure for all time.  Or nothing declared "conservation land" in this state can be considered safe.
     Under the new Plan, Greek housing (!!!) is to be built on this beautiful, valuable and irreplaceable forest.  It is not just "pretty", but supports federally endangered species (indigo snakes), threatened species (the flower, Garberia heterophylla, gopher tortoises, Gopherus polyphemus etc) and at least two bird species on the Audubon Watch list (because their numbers are in such drastic decline due to loss of habitat), the prairie warbler (Dendroica discolor) and the brown-headed nuthatch (Sitta pusilla).  I personally have logged 32 bird species in these woods, and photographed much of the diverse flora and fauna found there:  it is a magical place, an oudoor classroom! A source of inspiration, a place where one can find solitude and peace away from the hustle-bustle (Some might even say you can find God there, if you listen...I do.)
 
       Something that took eons to evolve to its specific complex state---does it make sense to wipe it out overnight?
 
      I submit that the value of this land to the university in its natural state---i.e. for botany & zoology students;  budding writers, painters, poets, philosophers---so far outweighs its sterile value as substrate for frat houses that it is amazing there is even a debate!  There ARE other sites to build those buildings without destroying a vibrant complex biosystem housing a sizable chunk of the imperilled species of our state.
 
     As you may know, The Sierra Club is now party to a legal petition challenging the UCF Master Plan on several points---including destruction of these NW woods, hazardous bisection of the pine flatwoods with a "connector road", building a parking garage atop endangered plant habitat which is part of the Arboretum, and the frivolous plans for a golf course (!!!) on campus.
    I support this petition, as do many (including botanists, herpetologists, ornithologists et al) who now are discovering what UCF has in mind. Until now, the public has been extremely ill-informed about the details of the Master Plan, but upon hearing about it are incensed and outraged---especially about removal of gopher tortoises a second or third time. Today, I heard from the president of the Dallas/Ft. Worth Herpetological Society (!!!), eager to know what members of his organization could do to help prevent the untimely demise of this intact habitat. Also, Orange Audbon has signed on in support of the legal petition and  protecting the crucial habitat in the Northwest woods.
 
     The FSU biologist, Matt Aresco (recently in the news for constructing an ecopassage between the two Lake Jacksons, thus saving 8000 turtles) has sent me a sound commentary---based in part on his scientific paper on gopher tortoises---appalled that a Florida University would behave so cavalierly toward our native species and wild lands.
 
   I do hope that if the UCF Board of Trustees fails to address this legal petition and/or public dissent re. the Master Plan within the 60 days they have to respond, I---or some of us---might make an appointment with you to discuss the merits of the ecological arguments for saving this land---to make the case for a thorough state review of UCF's plan.
 
   Thank you for your patience with this long letter. I just wanted you to know what was going on "in this neck of the woods".
 
Best Regards,
 
Rebecca Eagan

Subject: RE: The FL CAMS Bid at FDOR-very disturbing-please read fup


Governor,
Thank you for the opportunity to respond.  Major technology
acquisitions are very complex and vendor protests and time delays are
common. I personally recused myself from the process, and we established
a very professional process to ensure the right company is selected for
this critical undertaking.

We issued an Invitation to Negotiate (ITN) for the child support
enforcement computer system, known as CAMS, on February 1, 2002.  We
established an 11-member evaluation team, including four non-DOR
employees.  Seven vendors responded. 

As a result of the first phase of the evaluation process, we eliminated
three vendors from consideration for failing to meet the minimum points
for required topics and mandatory documents.  Two of them filed
protests.  One of the protests was related to the correct filing of a
form.  We were overruled by the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) on that
protest, and the vendor was allowed to continue in the process.  It is
important to note that the second protest challenged our selection
methodology and evaluation criteria.  The ALJ found in favor of the
Department, thus validating the department's selection methodology and
evaluation criteria.

After the full evaluation of the five eligible proposals was completed
by the evaluation team, we had a very divergent set of proposed
solutions, a broad range of cost proposals, and a large variance in the
technical scores for the vendors.   At that point, the Department
entered into the negotiation phase of the procurement with the five
vendors for the purpose of clarifying our goals and objectives and for
clarifying the vendors' proposals.  Following the negotiations, the
vendors submitted their best and final offers and the evaluation team
conducted the final scoring.

Among all of the vendors, the final point spread ranged between 1411.38
and 1500.43, so there was very little difference in the overall point
score.  The significant difference was in the critical technical and
management scoring.  In that evaluation, Deloitte received the high
score of 777.40 points and Covansys was the low scorer with 682.20. 
Covansys did not receive any first or second place votes from any of the
11 evaluators.  Covansys was second in the overall scoring only because
their cost proposal was so significantly below any of the other vendors.
 In following the methodology and criteria outlined in the ITN, which
had been previously upheld by the Administrative law Judge,  we approved
Deloitte as the successful vendor.  Because of their technical and
management score, we believe that Deloitte gives us the best opportunity
to develop a modern system to support the Child Support Enforcement
Program at a fair and reasonable price.

Mr. Weathers mentioned that Covansys is a minority vendor in Michigan,
implying they should receive consideration for that in Florida. However,
they did not include documentation in their proposal indicating they
were a Florida Certified Minority vendor as required by the ITN.  The
ITN included instructions on how to become a Florida Certified Minority
vendor and also included a form to fill out if this status was being
claimed.  Covansys has not raised this issue in the formal petition they
have filed with the Department.

After we posted the notice of intent to award the bid to Deloitte,
Covansys filed a protest.  That protest is now pending and will be
forwarded to the Division of Administrative Hearings (DOAH) after the
statutory informal resolution conference, which is scheduled for April
1.  If no resolution occurs at that conference, DOAH will then conduct a
thorough and complete review of the issues raised by Covansys and will
rule on their protest.

If we can provide additional information to you or to your staff at
this time, please let me know.

Dear Governor Bush, I am hoping this matter has been brought to your
attention by a number of independent sources.  The Florida Department
of
Revenue (FDOR) has awarded the child support system bid (called CAMS)
to
Deloitte Consulting.  Covansys, which is a certified minority firm in
the State of Michigan and an affiliate member of the Florida Regional
Minority Business Council, was in a statistical tie with Deloitte in
the
points evaluation, less than 1% separated the two firms.  The Covansys
bid was almost 40% lower in price, over $11M.  Covansys is one the
premier child support system vendors in the country and clearly should
have been awarded this work by FDOR, our solution is credible and our
experience and qualifications in this field are impeccable.  We hope
that someone in your administration will take up this matter and undo
this outrageous result.
Thank you for your attention to this matter,
Clint Weathers

Governor Bush,

The 36 small rural counties appreciate your expression of concern.  We
met on Wednesday and I am working with some of the rural legislators
(Rep. Brown and others) to design a "Safety Net" for those counties that
are at or close to the millage cap.  We are concerned that the
collective impact  program cuts will have too much impact on our
taxpayers to shoulder and we don't have a lot of options.    My proposal
doesn't cost the state 1 Cent - but would establish a pool of $$ that
small counties close to fiscal distress could draw on for one year to
soften the landing.

I am also talking to  Rep. Pickens about a concern that the District
Effort Recognition Program component of the Class Size bill has some
problems that will impact Small School Districts.  We agree effort
should be acknowledged and rewarded but the language doesn't factor in
some inherent inequities in the way "points of sale" impact rural
areas.  The reliance on the sales tax as a basis for distribution of the
District Effort Recognition Funds hinders those areas that don't have
points of sale.  I have spoken with Supt. David Miller and David Mosrie
about this and it a concern amongst the small district Supts.  It will
be a problem if it's not changed.

We want to make sure you are with us in the effort to address these
concerns ! Please advise on who you would like me to meet with to
discuss these issues further!

Dear Governor Bush:

I sent several e-mails to you concerning ongoing victim rights issues but to date I have not heard anything from you.  Today we had a hearing to ask the court to keep one of the males, who touched my child inappropriately and against her will, off our street.  We encountered, again, a combined State Attorney and Criminal Defense Attorney team arguing a victim does not have standing.  The judge said a higher court than he would have to find the legislative intent was to allow victims standing and the ability for victims to independently assert their rights.  He denied our Motion.  He further commented "If what you [the victim] argue is true, we'll all be on Sixty Minutes within the month.  I'll have to get my hair cut so I look nice"!  Perhaps the matter is a joke to the judiciary, criminal defense attorneys or the State Attorney but I assure you it is no joke to two parents fighting for the safety of their children.

Understand what we asked for.  We asked for the male who was originally charged with felony lewd and lecivious not be allowed on our street.  He has no family on our street and lives over two miles away!  We have three children still home ages 8, 13 and 15 that will, in net effect, be prisoners for no other reason than they are either a victim or a family member of a victim in order to protect them.  In the meantime, a criminal gets to walk up and down our street as he wishes.  All the while, the only party at this time that can make this argument to the court, the State Attorney, refuses to protect a very real innocent victim who also happens to be an innocent child.  My child.  Who will help this child if something else happens to her because protection was not afforded to her that was available?  It will be too little too late.

I can't remember in my lifetime ever being as angry and petrified for my children's safety as I am right now.  We met with Tena as requested.  Tena spoke to Mr. Wolfinger but we still sat in court this morning being the only ones publicly trying to do everything we could to protect a young lady who is just fifteen years old and her two younger siblings.  I believe Tena tried to help with Mr. Wolfinger but I am unsure as to what the conversation consisted of.

Media is just around the corner at this point and we are attempting to shield our child as much as possible but it appears that is going to be impossible with the questions coming.   I am aware Tonda was recently on Lifetime.  Nobody, from Tallahassee to Miami, understands why this is happening and in reality there is no reasonable explaination for the State Attorneys type of behavior. Members of the legislature who serve as Assistant State Attorneys, government staff who originally came from a State Attorneys office as well as other public servants are at a loss for words and are angry over the behavior exhibited.   

We will be appealing the decision immediately but do not expect an answer from the appellate court quick enough.  Are you willing to do anything and if so, what?  What are your opinions?

As always, your cooperation is appreciated.

Respectfully,
Shannon

Governor,

I attended the Rally on the lawn with a huge amount of the physicians that practice at TMH on Thursday.

You did GREAT! As did Byrd. King on the other hand, well, I'm sure you heard the reception he got.

Anyway, I did hand the small summary of the surgical technologists plight to the lovely lady at your office door around 1:45 p.m. I hope you got it and have a chance to look over it.

I love the speeches Thursday by all of the "important people", everyone made reference to quality patient care. That's what we have been trying to provide for the last 4 years! 

Our National certifying exam is psychometrically sound (a requirement for the state to look at adopting organizations existing tests) so Florida does not need to reinvent the wheel when it comes to delivering a standardized test. Licensing or registration fees could pay for the Boards and processing, and the continuing education could bring revenue to the state. These are just two basic points; trying to demonstrate that the parameters are there, the National organization has standards of care in place, we just need government intervention to ensure that all hospitals adhere to them. 

Again, thanks for your words of encouragement to the doctors. They, and the state, really are in serious trouble. 

We have to get back to caring for the patient. 

Thanks again,
Kathy Ashton,
President, Florida State Assembly of the 
Association of Surgical Technologists, Inc.

thank you Kay, for writing. As you know, the State of Florida is not in charge of the National Board Certified program. You are correct that we are one of the most significant supporters of the program. In fact, my guess is that we will be number one by the end of this year in terms of graduates. 

Having said that, I am asking Pat Levesque of my office to contact the program to see if we can lend a hand for you. If you weren't told that there was a minimum requirement in the beginning, it does not seem fair that you can't complete the course.

Subject: National Board for Professional Teaching Standards






Dear Governor Bush,

I am requesting intervention, if possible, please.

I am a candidate for the National Board certification.  This was the first
year that I was able to do so, as mine was a new area of certification
being offered for the first time--Latin.  I am 10 days from submitting my
portfolio and 1 to 5 weeks from taking my test.  Last night I was notified
by Mrs. Susan Woodward that our materials and tests will not be scored
unless there are 50 candidates.  Presently there are 18.  Nowhere does the
NBPTS literature say that this might be an eventuality.  We were informed
of no limitations.

        I have sacrificed and my family has sacrificed this year as I have
worked to meet all the standards set out by the National Board.  I cannot
believe that at this date my efforts will not even be judged.  They have
extended the deadline until December of 2003 for there to be 50 candidates.
But if there are not, then all the sacrifice, time and effort have been for
naught.  Even at that, I am required to wait an additional year for an
outcome.  None of this is as promoted.

The National Board wants to help the field of education be perceived as
more professional, but this action is highly unprofessional on their part.
Mrs. Woodward's reasons were that the entries could not be judged by
psychometric standards with so few and that the number of candidates did
not pay the cost of the NBPTS development.  I understand that, but that is
not something the candidates have control over and 10 days before
completion (in my case) or after completion (other candidates are totally
finished due to their testing dates and portfolio dates) is not acceptable.
They owe us to judge our materials.

With Florida promoting the National Board as it has and with Florida being
a state with one of the largest groups of candidates and board-certified
teachers, is there any way you can be of assistance?

Sincerely,
Kay Ruhle

I was hoping that you all would fund the Central Receiving Center here in Orlando. An alternative to jail for misdemeanors offender that have substance abuse problems and/or mentally ill.
 
Social services is probably a bottomless pit...and this Riyla Wilson thing...to me it points out the state bailing out a irresponsible mother and bottom feeders that poised to rip off the state. It is sad this missing child. I think the state was expertly scam by these women. The whole thing makes a poor case for social services. 
 
So...how much is too much for people that might never fully rehabilitate? I don't know. I think that they are building to many jails and it seems that everything is the crime of the century these days...politicians shaking in there boots over weight women activist laying on the couch eating bon bons and writing letters. They are set on eradicating the problem. 
 
We should always leave a way out for the willing in the spirit a humans ability to be reborn and mend old ways. 
 
I'm kind of tired of waving the flag for the underdog. I got a life too. Being argumentative and/or reactionary to this type stuff has not been good for my spirit. I know I have help change the way people think with there hard lined restorative justice approach. You have not struck me this way. And the gun thing..while even though quite harsh, I can kind of go along with it. 
 
For instance adding $500 to get your license back after it has been suspended. Do you know what a hardship that is for someone that has DUI school and many other hoops to jump through. I think government keeps tighing the noose around the average guys neck. 
 
We eradicate these problems and the fat lady on the couch smiles and the heat is off the politicians.All these jokers that have violated the law have moved on or run for cover. Drunks and the mentally ill continually are having there hands tied in recovery and rehabilitation is limited along with opportunities to live productively. 
 
We need to focus on intervention and alternatives to incarceration in early stages of substance abuse and/or criminal history. Like the drug court I think Chairman Crotty's idea for this alternative for low level offerener is something that he will make a success and will ultimately save money. 
 
I think the anomaly of substance abuse epidemics should supercede some of your ideology for smaller government because it is and anomaly of our times. Like other tragic situations that happen time to time through out civilization.
 
 
I don't know if I have the energy to protest lack of funding in any effective manner. All the folks on the jail oversight committee's that worked on this are waiting to see what happens or if more substance abuse tragedies like Susan Bennett and Karen Johnson (incarcerated death withdrawing from methadone). The situation has reach critical mass. People are ready for relief. 
 
I will remain positive and keep my fingers crossed.

Dear Gov. Bush,

Thank you for your e-mail.  It was a pleasure to meet you at the Breaker's last week.  I was one of the morning speakers who addressed the group about my new book Winning Decisions: Getting It Right the First Time.  I am a professor at the Wharton School as well as the Chairman and CEO of a strategy consulting firm.

I very much enjoyed your personal humor and relaxed style, as well as the interesting perspective you shared about the State of Florida (where I have a second residence).  In view of your remarks, I would like to offer two suggestions that may be of interest to you personally or perhaps to some in your administration.

First, since you mentioned many favorable trends for Florida, I wonder if your administration has actually developed multiple scenarios for the State of Florida.  This means look at trends in combination (rather than in isolation) as well as weaving in various uncertainties that may impact the future (from Cuba opening up to economic, technological, social and ecological developments).  I once worked with Dave Lawrence, when he was still the publisher at the Miami Herald, in order to develop such scenarios for S. Florida, but we never did the entire state.  I wonder if scenario planning might be an interesting way to map out robust political strategies internally as well as being a powerful means to present Florida's opportunities to external constituencies. (I have attached an article I wrote for the Sloan Management Review on scenario planning).

Second, you mentioned the high priority you assign to education.  I serve on the advisory board of the Decision Education Foundation ( www.def.org). This non-profit organization was recently founded by a group of successful business leaders, academics and consultants in order to bring critical thinking and decision making skills to high school students.  We are currently running pilot programs in the Bay area as well as in Philadelphia, and at some point may wish to roll this out with greater visibility at the State and Federal level.  Students learn many good things in high school but often still make unwise decisions about drugs, violence, personal relationships, career options, etc.  We hope to change that and I am curious if there is an interest at the State level to follow, or perhaps participate, in this noble endeavor.

Thank you again for addressing our conference.  It was a great pleasure to meet you in person.

Sincerely,

Paul

New treatment center set to open 
--------------------

By Sandra Mathers
Sentinel Staff Writer

March 28, 2003

Orange County's Central Receiving Center soon will open its doors in the rear of an old Pine Hills hospital.

The innovative community project is set to offer a bold experiment in managing thousands of drug-addicted and mentally ill indigents who need treatment, although at least one element of the project may not be in place as early as planned.

The center, located in the former Princeton Hospital off Mercy Drive, offers law-enforcement officials a single place to transport indigents charged with misdemeanors instead of taking them to the already-crowded Orange County Jail or clogged hospital emergency rooms.

Today, invited guests will get a first peek inside the center, which is scheduled to accept clients in less than two weeks.

The project is a collaboration of Orange County; the Florida Department of Children& Families; local hospitals; Lakeside Alternatives, the community's mental-health center; and The Center for Drug-Free Living, the county's largest state-funded drug treatment facility.

The nearly $5 million-a-year operation is the first of its kind in Florida -- and possibly the nation -- said Donna Wyche, assistant manager of theOrange County Youth & Family Services Division.

"We [in Florida] have never combined drug and mental-health clients in a central-access center before," Wyche said.

The center may be innovative, but it also carries many unknowns, officials admit.

For instance, no one knows how many clients it will handle annually -- the drug-treatment system has not tracked the number of substance abusers taken to the county jail and local hospitals.

"We get to develop the baseline data for our community," said Michele Saunders, a vice president at Lakeside Alternatives.

What is known is the number of mental-health clients -- 3,500 annually -- that enter the system through the Baker Act, the state law that allows people to be held involuntarily for evaluation at hospitals or mental-health centers, Saunders said. She estimated an additional 1,000 to 2,000 substance-abuse clients could be served at the center.

Also, no one knows ifthe Central Receiving Center will be able to offer the planned 20 short-term beds for indigents that were to be available later this year. Touted as one of the more innovative elements of the program, they are needed to supplement the scarcity of local treatment beds caused by years of inadequate state funding, officials said.

Money for the CRC's beds and connected services, which $3 million of the center's first-year operating budget, didn't make it into the governor's budget this legislative session.

Orange County delegation chairman Rep. Andy Gardiner, R-Orlando, said he hopes to salvage the money.

"I don't think we're out of the running yet," Gardiner said Thursday.

The chronic bed shortage leaves Orange County with just 40 slots for people withdrawing from drugs. That forces the Center for Drug-Free Living to turn people away, officials said.

Also in short supply are long-term treatment beds for indigent substance abusers and the mentally ill.

To ease the strain, the CRC will refer some clients to private, faith-based drug and mental-health treatment and counseling programs, in addition to licensed, government-funded programs, Wyche said.

That's another untried practice in Orange County. And Wyche said they can't force people into that option.

Thank you for your very quick reply; I am impressed (sat. at 10:30 pm).
 
The challenge in scenario planning is indeed to reduce the many possibilities into a few archetypal ones that bound the future.

Subject: UCF Master Plan/ NW conservation land


Dear Gov. Bush:
 
    I wanted to take a moment to let you know that noteworthy opposition to the recently approved UCF Master Plan is growing among citizens and organizations here (even in other states, it seems!), largely due to the gross environmental degradation and procedural "irregularities" implementation of the Plan would entail.
     As cited to you a couple of months back, before the Board of Trustees had yet voted for approval, of special concern to ME (and many) is the planned destruction of the pristine sandhill scrub and pine flatwoods ecosystems in the Northwest quadrant.  This was originally designated as a preserve---and has always been called "The Preserve"---and was done in mitigation for other lands being developed on campus.  With that designation, Fish & Wildlife allowed gopher tortoises to be relocated there as their permanent home.  It should only be for a human life or death reason, in my opinion, that the status of this conservation area be violated. By all legal and ethical logic, its boundaries should be secure for all time.  Or nothing declared "conservation land" in this state can be considered safe.
     Under the new Plan, Greek housing (!!!) is to be built on this beautiful, valuable and irreplaceable forest.  It is not just "pretty", but supports federally endangered species (indigo snakes), threatened species (the flower, Garberia heterophylla, gopher tortoises, Gopherus polyphemus etc) and at least two bird species on the Audubon Watch list (because their numbers are in such drastic decline due to loss of habitat), the prairie warbler (Dendroica discolor) and the brown-headed nuthatch (Sitta pusilla).  I personally have logged 32 bird species in these woods, and photographed much of the diverse flora and fauna found there:  it is a magical place, an oudoor classroom! A source of inspiration, a place where one can find solitude and peace away from the hustle-bustle (Some might even say you can find God there, if you listen...I do.)
 
       Something that took eons to evolve to its specific complex state---does it make sense to wipe it out overnight?
 
      I submit that the value of this land to the university in its natural state---i.e. for botany & zoology students;  budding writers, painters, poets, philosophers---so far outweighs its sterile value as substrate for frat houses that it is amazing there is even a debate!  There ARE other sites to build those buildings without destroying a vibrant complex biosystem housing a sizable chunk of the imperilled species of our state.
 
     As you may know, The Sierra Club is now party to a legal petition challenging the UCF Master Plan on several points---including destruction of these NW woods, hazardous bisection of the pine flatwoods with a "connector road", building a parking garage atop endangered plant habitat which is part of the Arboretum, and the frivolous plans for a golf course (!!!) on campus.
    I support this petition, as do many (including botanists, herpetologists, ornithologists et al) who now are discovering what UCF has in mind. Until now, the public has been extremely ill-informed about the details of the Master Plan, but upon hearing about it are incensed and outraged---especially about removal of gopher tortoises a second or third time. Today, I heard from the president of the Dallas/Ft. Worth Herpetological Society (!!!), eager to know what members of his organization could do to help prevent the untimely demise of this intact habitat. Also, Orange Audbon has signed on in support of the legal petition and  protecting the crucial habitat in the Northwest woods.
 
     The FSU biologist, Matt Aresco (recently in the news for constructing an ecopassage between the two Lake Jacksons, thus saving 8000 turtles) has sent me a sound commentary---based in part on his scientific paper on gopher tortoises---appalled that a Florida University would behave so cavalierly toward our native species and wild lands.
 
   I do hope that if the UCF Board of Trustees fails to address this legal petition and/or public dissent re. the Master Plan within the 60 days they have to respond, I---or some of us---might make an appointment with you to discuss the merits of the ecological arguments for saving this land---to make the case for a thorough state review of UCF's plan.
 
   Thank you for your patience with this long letter. I just wanted you to know what was going on "in this neck of the woods".
 
Best Regards,
 
Rebecca Eagan

Dear Governor Bush,
Yesterday, CRB hold its forum and press confernce on 
the theme * There is no place for Hate* and it went
well. But we did not see any bodly FDLE, INS and 
Justice dartment. 
This was also live on cable.
Muslims communtieis from CAIR and for CRB,I made
presentations.
I must tell both dade and browar schools are very
active in creating understanding among students and
were pleased with reports.
I also request you in this difficult time, and when
you find opportunity, please meet with us in presence
few directors from different homeland secutries and
other agencies. There is definite need to educate 
law enforcements agencies about the culture, fear,
dealings with muslim communities and how to seek 
community co-operation. Recently, there is so 
presure on the family of Miramar whose son is
suspected
and unable to find. The father lost his job and there
is pressure from media for covering stories on their
personal lives. There has to be some system. This
create fear amongs families and stop doing their
normal
activites.
I believe we need some action.
Regards,
Ahmed

thank you Randy. Is Chuck Cobb involved in this? 

Jeb Bush



Yes, I have been working with Chuck(Informationtionally), Luis (Broward Mayoral meetings), and Hugh Simon (Data, Consul General and Trade Ministers) Ines (Speaking engagements and FTAA hard copy). We have quietly worked the politics behind the scenes to bring the respective Mayors to the table. Mayor Naugle has been a great asset, and our new Mayor in Broward has helped worked some magic. (We have persuaded Broward to come in with $50,000 for 5 Trustees. Diana will slip the list of 5 to Chuck for either you or him to name to give Mayor Wasserman cover from political hacks. She will name 5 top international business leaders. All will be involved in the event.
We have expanded the base to include the business engines in the 3 counties. Now that Jorge Arrizurieta is on the team, we have begun including him on the planning. We now will reach to the regional CEO's and try and build the Trustee base. I updated Jorge to the fact that I am using my SCI Vice Presidents credentials to discuss sister cities and slipped into FTAA facts about the importance of the Secretariat to all of Florida, as I have made presentations to growing audiences in Jacksonville, Orlando, and Tampa. I am speaking at the Florida League of Cities later in April and discussing the $100 + million in international business that SCI brought to FLL and South Florida under that umbrella. It all fits. I have been contacted by South Florida CEO magazine, The Palm Beach Post, Miami Herald and have done FTAA interviews with each. The excitement is building with the regional support concept for FTAA. The new regional IBC is the perfect non [political conduit. It takes me back to my State Jaycee Presidency when I had every candidate for the Presidency come to our state meeting by working them one at a time---simultaneously.

Long answer-but I want you totally up to speed. There were a lot of people who watched the 3 year transformation of the sister city program that now believe. I will utilize that belief to help us win the Secretariat. I led the effort to bring The world Jaycees to Coral Gables 40 years ago and I have strong business ties to many heads of State that will help our efforts. Have a great Sunday. Aloha, Randy

On May 28, I plan to be in California and, therefore, will be unable to participate in the "Regional International Unity Awards Dinner."  I would very much like to attend this great regional effort, but I am unable to change my commitment in California.

Hello-
I hope you and your family are well.  I have tried to write this e-mail several times over the last couple of days as I know it is important however, it is difficult to see importance in the "normal" life issues as we watch our military folks fighting and sacrificing and personally, as so many others, while I worry about my family that is sacrificing.  
 
I know that I need to share this with you so I'm finally writing the e-mail. I would imagine you or your staff are aware of this but I was concerned when I received the following:
 
Dear Members,

Today the following language was added to the Implementing Bill in the House of Representatives by the Appropriations Committee:

HOUSE AMENDMENT

        Bill No. 

Section 55. In order to implement Specific Appropriation 2545 of the 2003-2004 General Appropriations Act, effective July 1, 2003, all powers, duties, functions, records, personnel property, and unexpended balances of appropriations allocations, and other funds of the Council for Education Policy Research and Improvement are transferred by a type two transfer as defined in s. 20.06 to the Office of the Auditor General. Notwithstanding the provisions of s. 1008.51*, all powers, duties, funding and functions of the Council for Education Policy Research and Improvement are suspended for the 2003-2004 fiscal year. The Auditor General may, within the funding provided, provide policy research and analysis of education issues.

The bill will now go to the entire House of Representatives to be vote upon.  This vote will take place sometime next week.

This move essentially does away with the Council and the staff.  I believe strongly in having a lay board that can recommend education policy and conduct research in an independent and objective manner.  The language calls into question if, and to what extent, any education research would be conducted and policy recommendations would be developed. I believe that it would be a significant loss to the policy makers of the state to have staff driven research and policy recommendations rather than have research and policy recommendations that have been developed and approved by a citizen board-

 

It has been an honor and privilege to serve on PEPC and CEPRI and I appreciate your trust in my ability to do so and thank you for the opportunity.  If CEPRI continues, I am proud to continue as I see so much potential for good things from CEPRI.  If it does not continue, I would offer that I would be honored to serve our state and your administration in any way you would trust me to do so.

My entire family appreciates you and your family for your leadership, sacrifices and true love and concern for our state and our country.  You, your family and our President are in our thoughts and prayers.  

 

Regards,

Diane

Hi Jeb 

It was great seeing you for a few seconds at Deering Bay last Sunday. Thanks for stopping. 

I'm on a plane this morning back up to Boston, via Dulles, and just read today's article in the Washington Post. Actually, to my untrained eye, it seems pretty positive.

I've been meaning to write or call to ask who I should speak to at the State of Florida about the State looking at our web-based energy monitoring, control and conservation System.  WebGen (www.webgensystems.com) is presently using its artificial intelligence to monitor and/or control energy consumption at many (65) of the State of Callifornia's largest buildings and we are now producing significant energy consumption and dollar savings (documented now in excess of 10%).  We're currently in negotiations with the State of Massachusetts; are running almost 100 of Bank of America's major and minor buildings across California and elsewhere (including installations occuring now at several of its 'critical facilities'); continue to provide energy conservation and dollar savings to University of Miami (documented by Dr. Alex Domijan, Director of the Florida Power Affiliates and Power Quality Lab at the University of Florida); and are now installing in a number of other customers in California, Florida, New England and New York, We just completed an installation in Coral Gables for Philip Blumberg and had entered into serious conversations with George Kirkpatrick and ICUF prior to George's untimely death.

I would very much appreciate it if you'd be willing to direct me to the relevant person in the State. I believe that what we're doing is a logical and now-proven platform for you to introduce a really significant BHAG of permanently reducing energy consumption in Florida by at least an additional 10% beyond existing State connservation/curtailment programs. 

Dorothy sends her regards and our best to Columba and the kids. 

I'll look forward to hearng from you. 

Best, 

David

Governor,
I plan to be in Tallahassee on April 1st and 2nd for the FL League of Cities Legislative Action Day. It is spring break for our area students and I will be bring my 12 year old daughter, Christina, with me to observe our Great State Government in action. I know we are in busy times both Nationally and Statewide, but want to see if there is anyway possible for you to take a couple minutes out of your busy schedule to meet Christina and say hello. She is a great student and we hope to enroll her in the International Baccalaureate program that local public school, Cocoa Beach Jr/Sr High School is expanding this coming year to the middle year students, they already have a very successful High School program. Christina has been following your administration and has had some "enlightening" comments, both pro and con on some of your ideas! (I told her if she ever met you to be nice!) Is there any time on the 1st in the afternoon, or on the 2nd in the morning that you might have a minute, of course at your convenience, that you might be able to meet her and to stress the importance of  both community involvement and school? 
I appreciate everything you've been doing, (except unfunded mandates!). However, the hard decisions are always the ones that build character, and overall I feel you have done an exceptional job.
Thanks,

Jeb, 
     I hope that someone in Tallahassee is reconsidering the new school that has been proposed in Holmes County!  I am referring to the "Poplar Springs" school.  This location is reported to have over 1,000 students.  If that were true, why is there graduating class only 20 to 25 students per year?  We do not need another school in this county!  The "Bethlehem" school is less than 10 miles from Poplar Springs and it isn't near full capacity.  We are struggling with how to pay for the class room size requirements, and this project alone is estimated at $14 million dollars, and for what practical purpose?  I am sure that I'm not the first person to mention this, but I hope that your staff is looking into this!
 
Thank You!

Read it and pass it along, it might actually get to someone who needs to see it!!! 






After hearing that the state of Florida changed its opinion and let a Muslim woman have her picture on her driver's license with her face covered this is an editorial written by an American citizen, published in a Tampa newspaper. He did quite a job; didn't he? Read on, please! 

>IMMIGRANTS, NOT AMERICANS, MUST ADAPT. I am tired of this nation worrying about whether we are offending some individual or their culture. Since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, we have experienced a surge in patriotism by the majority of Americans. However, the dust from the attacks had barely settled when the "politically correct" crowd began complaining about the possibility that our patriotism was offending others. 

I am not against immigration, nor do I hold a grudge against anyone who is seeking a better life by coming to America. Our population is almost entirely made up of descendants of immigrants. However, there are a few things that those who have recently come to our country, and apparently some born here, need to understand. This idea of America being a multicultural community has served only to dilute our sovereignty and our national identity. As Americans, we have our own culture, our own society, our own language and our own lifestyle. This culture has been developed over centuries of struggles, trials, and victories by millions of men and women who have sought freedom. 

We speak ENGLISH, not Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, or any other language. Therefore, if you wish to become part of our society, learn the language! 

"In God We Trust" is our national motto. This is not some Christian, right wing, political slogan. We adopted this motto because Christian men and women, on Christian principles, founded this nation, and this is clearly documented. It is certainly appropriate to display it on the walls of our schools. If God offends you, then I suggest you consider another part of the world as your new home, because God is part of our culture. 

If Stars and Stripes offend you, or you don't like Uncle Sam, then you should seriously consider a move to another part of this planet.

Governor Bush,

Thanks for a fast reply. Sorry for being so vague. I guess what I am asking 
is there any particular areas of study that would benifit you or your staff? 
I am interested in politics and am an avid fan of what you have done. If I 
could do a study that might benifit your administration, it would make the 
process far more benifitial and enjoyable. If you think of anything that you 
guys would like to research even perhaps regarding things that have changed 
because of your administration, let me know. I also want to do anything I 
can to help further your future political career. I am thinking about 
getting Newt Gingrich to be the outside committee member on my disertation 
committee. That is if we can get him to behave, of course! I have about 6 
months before I make a decision regarding a topic. I want to help in any way 
I can, so please let me know if there is anything I can do. Both with the 
dissertation and in any of your future endeavors.

I am very proud of your work as our Governor.

Sincerely,
Robby Brown

I still can't believe people think like this in the year 2003!

Dear Governor Bush:

I have been trying to get an appointment with you and have been having a difficult time.  I was referred to Kimberly Dale here in the Tampa Bay area.  I don't think she understands the magnitude of the problem that exists in Pinellas County regarding our problem, which is property rights issues and I would greatly appreciate it if you could intervene.

Waterfront homeowners here in Pinellas County have been denied permits to trim permits in order to obtain their views of the water.  The program which the county has taken delegation of, is not properly implementing the state statutes.  The Board of Realtors have sent a resolution to the county commissioners reqarding property rights of waterfront homeowners and to enforce the statutes rather than their arbitrary and subjective rules that don't exist.

Thank you so much for your time and effort.  Please don't refer me to Kathryn Gilbert in Tallahassee.  Frankly, she is a green person and has not been helpful up to this time.

>You guys have a good price from ACS ... about $0.22 per claim without change orders.  The problem is not the unit price, its the number of units.  Back of the napkin, it seems to me that you guys are processing well over four times the number of claims as there are actual encounters ...that's rework, paid for by you, in the hundreds of percents.  The problem is that making this go away would more than halve the revenue to ACS.  Something they would not like very much.  THis is why they don't escalate issues and why they don't do claim acknowledgement... they don't get paid to get it right the first time... in fact, they DO get paid to get the doctor to get it wrong as many times as possible.  I'm not saying that they are in any way ill-willed.  It's just that  building front end claim acknowledgment is expensive... so is having service reps on the phone who actually resolve issues and no where on their contract (including their "scorecard") do they get paid for such investments. An example: If they have a scorecard item for average answer time but not issue resolution rate, the business decsion is to have more cheaper reps rather fewer, higher skill reps.
>
>Recomendations:
>*	Require that they do claim acknowledgment AND tell Texas to require it!  Texas just highered them and they have it today.  I'll bet that losing it would be a bigger step backwards than ANY improvement in unit price they may be getting.
>*	Add a "first pass rate" bonus to their scored card ... a big one.  This would pay them for increasing the number of claims settled on the first try.  There are dozens of little things that they could do to drive this number up dramatcially if they thought there was an ROI for it. Right now, effectiveness improvements really hurt them financially and they shouldn't.  Aside from the financial benefit that comes from this, you may have a cleaner claims database with which to do medical managment and you WILL have whole lot less heartburn from providers.

>As I mentioned on the phone, Athenahealth is moving its back office service for medical groups into Florida.  We are in the midst of implementing Miami Children's Medical Group which depends greatly on Medicaid and which much in the way of criticism for Medicaid.  As such, we thought it wise to meet with the management there to learn if there were improvement opportunities we could help with.  It may not be what the doctors (our beloved clients) want to hear but we have gone back to tell them that Florida has a FANTASTIC Medicaid plan compared with any of the 24 state Medicaid plans we deal with. Here are some of the notes:
> 
>We had a great meeting last Friday with some of the Florida Medicaid management team and a representative from ACS.  These seemed like great folks and as a billing agent who deals with 26 different state Medicaid Plans I was glad to see them performing so well.>
>*	The denial rate is high (50% of claims that MDs submit are rejected on the first try), BUT the adjudication cycle is rapid so the total physician days sales in receivable outstanding with our clients average only 58.  In other states, that number can easily exceed 100!
>*	Aside from a fast adjudication cycle, the phone response is very rapid relative to other state plans. They have a hard time with more complex questions and there doesn't seem to be any escalation process in place for complex issue resolution, BUT they said that plans to activate such a unit were under consideration!
>*	Electronic intermediation is generally strong.  They use a wide range of intermediaries (nine in total which is EXCELLENT... more is always better). They provide extremely detailed electronic eligibility messages which is also excellent (though at least one of their vendors ... ours! ...doesn't pass that through). They also provide electronic remittance advice
>*	The biggest opportunity for improvement is claim acknowledgement.  Florida Medicaid is one of only very few payors nationally (about 15%) that cannot/does not send claim-level electronic acknowledgement back to submitters.  This costs both ACS AND Florida needed funds.  Some practices make phone calls for non-received claims (over 13% of claims that MDs think they sent are not received by ACS) which costs ACS money since they are paid per claims not per call.  Also, many medical practices don't invest in phone call inquiries but instead send repeat claims which often leads to duplicate claim processing (this costs Florida).  We registered our thoughts on this during the meeting.
>*	There were other operational issues we reviewed that go in the category of "continuous improvement".  Again, we were impressed by the responsiveness and interest in smoothing issues out.
>

Governor,
           Thank you for your presence in Escambia County at today's groundbreaking for the Navy Federal Credit Union.  As a Vice President of the engineering firm (Baskerville-Donovan) which did the master plan and infrastructure design we welcomed your gracious words. 
          I mentioned to you during our brief chat that I was one of your private sector appointees to the State Partnership for School Readiness Board. (In fact, I will be in Tallahassee tomorrow Wednesday, March 19 for our Board meeting at the Civic Center.)
          However I did not mention to you the conversations I have been having with your staff about the systematic undermining of your commitment to family involvement the Early Intervention Program.
     Donovan Brown, Teresa Tinker and most recently Meta Calder have all heard parts of the specifics of why I believe that the Department of Health's Early Intervention Service have deliberately worked to destroy your policy of family involvement>
     Who am I to make these assertions?
          1. Father of Chelsey Blair Kendig a fourteen year old child with multiple special needs who has been through the Early Intervention Program in its better years.  Chelsey has pictures of the two of you taken at the first two Family CAFE meetings.
          2.  Grandfather of Jacob Stephen Mumblow a three year old who is exiting the Early Intervention Services program. He and his mother have lived with us for the last year.
          3.  Chairman of the Northwest Florida Regional Policy Council for Early Intervention Services during it first three years...1999, 2000, 2001.  A noble and needed Bush Administration initiative in shared governance undermined by the bureaucracy from its start.
              4.  Former local government executive serving seven years as Escambia County Administrator then nine years as Pensacola City Manager.  I know first hand how to discourage effective citizen involvement subtly and straight on.  I know bridge tending when I see and I know how to first managers who undercut and sabotage Council policy.    
          5.  The other half of the husband and wife team who served as foster parents for forty new born babies while serving as City Manager.  By the way Chelsey was number 41 and we adopted her after caring for this extra ordinary joy giver.
          6. Community leader serving as Chairman of the Lakeview Center Board, member of the Escambia ARC, member of the Exceptional Student Education Advisory Council of Escambia County, etc, etc .
           Do this mean I know it all?  No.
           Does it mean I recognize a bureaucracy dedicated to process over people, program managers deaf to those receiving services? Yes.  Does it mean that I know a good cop bad cop routine when I am exposed to that routine as I have been in the Department of Health when I present my concerns and evidence? Yes,
          Please have an independent from the Health Department review.  I especially ask you to do so now since the Department as convened this week in Tampa a mock Early Intervention Stakeholders workgroup in Tampa.  The number of family members attending as stakeholders is prima facie evidence of the disregard for your policy of meaningful involvement of families with children with special needs.
                 Thank you for commitment and deep seated belief in making a difference in the lives of our State's special children.

Governor:

 

There is going to be a meeting in a few weeks at Miami Dade Public schools regarding a proposal to build out a wireless infrastructure for the entire school system.  It is an interesting proposal.  The network would save the district substantial amounts of money because 1) it will drastically reduce their hi-speed costs for traditional DSL and Cable 2) it will allow them to offer distance learning for classroom size problems 3) it can create revenue-generating opportunities for the school as a hi-speed provider to residents (ISP). The source of funding for the project is the federal govt. "E-rate" program, a program that Florida has been able to get significant funding from. 

 

I am interested in this as a model for charter schools.  I like the idea, particularly, the proposition of charter schools having sustainable income from becoming an ISP.  This idea has not been explored as far as I know.  I believe Federal start up money could also be used to develop this.  I know some members of Congress are pushing to end the E-rate program citing problems with misappropriations, etc.  I would any thoughts you have on this project and e-rate, because I believe Florida has benefited from the program.

Dear Jeb,
 
Please look over this heartbreaking story.  I will try to find more details, but as of now I am concerned that this sounds like the poor judgment we so frequently saw in the HRS of Florida's past.  (DCF attorney Tony DeLuccia has been with the department for decades since Janet Reno's glory days as a family disrupter.  Separating a husband and wife of 56 years didn't seem to be a very big deal according to DeLuccia's quotes in this article.  He actually seemed more concerned that no one mistake the Gulf Coast Village for a "respite hotel")
 
Apparently the state appointed a lawyer to represent the wife, but the husband had no defense against this practiced system.
 
The husband went to senior caregivers for help and lost his wife.  He may be a "burnt out caregiver", but he is likely the best caregiver for this woman.  It is also in the best interest of the state to support him in keeping his wife at home rather than to take her in as a ward of the state.
 
I hope this is an isolated incident, but I fear it is the new call to action for witch hunters.  Please also be sure the state is not funding any respite services at the Gulf Coast Village since DCF wants the entire community assured that they are not designed for that service.
 
Thanks for listening, and God bless,
 
Marie Dinon

Bill Wright thinks he did right - yet he wonders how it turned out all wrong. 


Ten days ago, Bill, 77, noticed bruises on the arms of his wife, Jeanne, who he says is a six-year sufferer of Alzheimer's disease. 


He asked Jeanne, who will be 76 on Monday, what happened to her arms? 


"She just smiled and pointed to me,'' Bill says. "I cried.'' 


Tears continued Friday. 


A special master ruled in an emergency temporary guardianship hearing that Jeanne was in imminent danger living with Bill and made her a ward of the state. 


"I never would have believed that someone could walk into my house and take my wife,'' Bill says. 


The Wrights, who live in Cape Coral, have been married for 56 years. 


Bill blames himself for being too honest. 


He didn't remember hurting his wife, but he did recall punishing her for pulling a dressing off a sacral ulcer. 


"She had a boil on her behind. When I put a bandage on it, she would sneak away and pull it off,'' Bill says. "I slapped her hand. I slapped her arm. Just slaps.'' 


Bill says he took Jeanne to Gulf Coast Village, an assisted living center with an Alzheimer's wing, March 13. 


"I did something terrible,'' he told a social worker and center workers. "I slapped her and now she has bruises. Could you keep her for a while until I get organized?'' 


Last Monday, Bill took his wife home from the center. 


A little before noon, a state Department of Children & Families investigator, a social worker and two Cape Coral cops paid him a visit. 


They told him Jeanne had to return to the center. 


"We considered him a burned-out caregiver,'' says Sandra Mosher of DCF. 


Bill doesn't disagree. 


He tried to plead his case with DCF attorney Tony DeLuccia on Friday. 


Bill wants Gulf Coast Village to care for Jeanne in the daytime and he will take her home at night. 


"This is not a respite hotel,'' DeLuccia told him. "That's out of the question.'' 


Social worker Becky Duncan says Bill needs to let go. 


"I think he has unrealistic expectations,'' she says about Jeanne's health improving. "He's in complete denial.'' 


Jeanne - diagnosed with terminal Alzheimer's - sits at the table during the hearing and dozes off. Bill pulls her head to his shoulder. 


He can't quit caring. 


The love is evident along with the irony. Twenty minutes later, the verdict separates 56 years together. 


"He took great care of her,'' says Vernetta Johnson, a caregiver who worked for Bill for two years. "I wish my husband would take that good of care of me.'' 


Bill says he's going to a doctor Monday and try to prove he's competent. 


"I'm not nuts,'' he says. 


A decision will be made in Jeanne's case in 60 days. 


"What looks cruel and inhuman on the surface is not,'' says Bob Lipshutz, Jeanne's attorney. 


"Nobody's coming in here trying to take this woman from her husband.'' 


You'll never convince Bill of that - right or wrong.

Subject:	FW: Charter School Test Scores Out Rank Others

Finally!  Good news about charter schools!  Alex:)


"CHARTER API NEWS:
Veteran Charter Schools Outperform Non-Charters on API
An analysis of the Academic Performance Index (API) conducted by the
Charter Schools Development Center shows that charter schools operating
for 5 or more years out-performed non-charter schools and their younger
charter peers on the recently released 2002 API base scores.

In addition, an analysis of this past fall's API growth scores shows
that 70 percent of charter schools demonstrated improvement over their
previous year's API scores.  The percentage of charter schools receiving
API scores is still too small to draw conclusions about the API
performance of charter

schools overall.  API scores are also only one indicator of academic
success.  Nonetheless, these early results are promising.

Subject: School Choices All Around 

Date: Thu, 27 Mar 2003 22:54:22 -0800 

JC,

While all eyes are on Iraq, the school choice movement quietly moves forward . . .

Dateline:  Colorado

 

In what looks to be the first new school voucher program since the Supreme Court ruling, Kevin Teasley from the  <http://64.4.30.250/cgi-bin/linkrd?_lang=EN&lah=a9554708795637c24f375122ffd1e30f&lat=1049069642&hm___action=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2egeofoundation%2eorg> Greater Education Opportunities sends word that:

After four years of struggle, educational activities, grassroots mobilizing, legislative coaxing, numerous fact trips to Milwaukee, and lots of endless meetings, Colorado will be the next state to adopt vouchers.  Today, the Colorado Senate approved House Bill 1160 which allows children in the state's lowest performing schools to take 85 percent of their funding to a private or parochial school of their choice.


 

The Wall Street Journal's John Fund reports on more details of the Colorado program:

The Colorado choice program is quite limited. It tightly restricts the number of eligible students in the early years to 6,000, limits participation to 12 districts where at least eight schools have been rated "low" or "unsatisfactory," and allows only students who qualify for free or reduced-price lunches to apply for a voucher equal to 85% of the state's portion of education costs. School districts lose nothing when a student takes his voucher to another school--except public acknowledgement that they failed that student. Just maybe that will prompt them to improve.

The House already approved 1160 and now it is a matter of procedure for the bill to be signed into law by Gov. Owens. 

 

Dateline: Florida

 

It looks like Florida will be a shoe-in again for number one in Manhattan Institute's  <http://64.4.30.250/cgi-bin/linkrd?_lang=EN&lah=e52939d0ebbce87865f003be916568ca&lat=1049069642&hm___action=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2emanhattan%2dinstitute%2eorg%2fhtml%2fcr_14%2ehtm> Education Freedom Index . Governor Bush continues his incremental approach to school choice. There are 15,000 students using the corporate tax credits with the $50 million a year cap to receive scholarships to private schools; several thousand students in charter schools; 10,000 students using McKay special education scholarships for private schools, a few hundred students from failing schools using opportunity scholarships; and now a proposal to satisfy the class-size reduction initiative by using scholarships to send kids to private schools; and finally a bill to use a tax-credits to offer scholarships to  <http://64.4.30.250/cgi-bin/linkrd?_lang=EN&lah=70a371fe3102a2e46701257c2a70938a&lat=1049069642&hm___action=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2eorlandosentinel%2ecom%2forl%2dlocvouchers26032603mar26%2c0%2c1596791%2estory%3fcoll%3dorl%252Dhome%252Dheadlines> soldiers' children .  

 

As the March 25  Sun-Sentinel reports:

The House answer to the voter mandate to cap class would allow parents of any child entering kindergarten to have a $3,500 state voucher to attend a private school and would also let school districts use vouchers to help reduce class size at any grade level.

As for the military tax credit the March 26 Sun-Sentinel reports:

The House approved a military voucher bill Tuesday after a bitter debate that crossed party lines. It provides $10 million in tax credits to corporations that donate money for scholarships enabling soldiers' children to attend private school. The bill was passed after a one-hour debate pitting veterans against one another and revolving around competing claims of patriotism.

 

Dateline: Arizona

 

 <http://64.4.30.250/cgi-bin/linkrd?_lang=EN&lah=714714eb1121f116259585deeca93064&lat=1049069642&hm___action=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2egoldwaterinstitute%2eorg%2findex%2ephp> The Goldwater Institute sends word that on, March 24, the Arizona State Senate delivered a victory for proponents of educational freedom. With a bipartisan majority of 16 votes, the Senate passed SB1263, a corporate scholarship tax credit program that could give thousands of low-income, public school students the opportunity to transfer to private schools next fall.

The legislation, based on an idea put forth in a Goldwater Institute research study <http://64.4.30.250/cgi-bin/linkrd?_lang=EN&lah=c04159b208119b9fc2afcb6311c92027&lat=1049069642&hm___action=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2egoldwaterinstitute%2eorg%2farticle%2ephp%2f18%2ehtml>  last spring, would allow corporations to receive a dollar-for-dollar tax credit for donations to fund private school scholarships.  Those scholarships would be used to provide school choice for public school students who qualify for the federal free and reduced school lunch program. 

 <http://64.4.30.250/cgi-bin/linkrd?_lang=EN&lah=997702f69e22faa24c387beca7d3cca1&lat=1049069642&hm___action=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2echildrenfirstamerica%2eorg%2favfc%2findex%2ehtm> Children's First America reports: 

The bill now goes to the House, where support is considered to be much stronger than in the senate. "Arizona already has an individual tax credit law in which citizens can direct up to $500 ($650 for couples) of their tax burden to organizations which grant scholarships for families to use at the school of their choice. Unlike the individual tax credit, however, the proposed corporate scholarships would be available only to those students currently enrolled in public schools who are eligible for the federal free or reduced-price lunch program. In addition, figures from legislative budget staffers indicate that the program will be revenue positive, as the state has a net gain of $2,000 per student that transfers. The measure would cap the scholarship fund at $10 million the first year, but that figure would rise to $50 million after four years.

Dateline: Compton

 

If there is anyplace that needs more competition and choice, Compton is the place. The Los Angeles Times reports on State Assemblyman Ray Haynes's   <http://64.4.30.250/cgi-bin/linkrd?_lang=EN&lah=7df713c5cb80a494cd087026fd2f10b3&lat=1049069642&hm___action=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2elatimes%2ecom%2fnews%2flocal%2fla%2dme%2dvouchers24mar24%2c1%2c7837914%2estory%3fcoll%3dla%252Dheadlines%252Dcalifornia> bill  to give kids in Compton a way out.

 

The Compton experiment would be modeled after the highly popular Cal Grant program for college students, which provides the financially neediest students with grants of as much as $9,708 a year to pay tuition and student fees.

Haynes refused to detail his strategy for getting the bill approved in a Legislature dominated by Democrats who oppose vouchers. But he indicated that packaging the subsidies as scholarships similar to Cal Grant subsidies would make the bill more attractive to Democrats.

The plan would get a five-year test run, starting Jan. 1. The results would be evaluated and decisions made on whether to expand it elsewhere.

As a potential model for the rest of the state, Haynes said, Compton "was a good place to start.... What we need in Compton is a revolution." . . .

Haynes identified the sponsors of his bill as about 50 Compton parents and a nonprofit organization known as the Coalition on Urban Renewal and Education, a conservative, religion-based think tank with an office in Los Angeles. It was founded by commentator Star Parker, a one-time Los Angeles welfare mother who wrote the book "Pimps, Whores and Welfare Brats."

"We wanted to submit a bill that had to be taken seriously. We did not want a bill that would be thrown out because it was not constitutionally acceptable or credible," said Timothy McGhee, the organization's director of community affairs.

But Haynes said it will be very difficult to push the bill through the Legislature and get it signed by Gov. Gray Davis, who opposes vouchers. Haynes said he told the Compton parents that it would take lots of work and expansion of their group of 50 parents to "something more like 10,000" for the bill to succeed.

Dateline: Washington DC

 

President Bush has allocated $75 million in his fiscal-year 2004 budget to fund voucher programs in seven or eight cities, including Washington.

Arizona Rep. Jeff Flake has introduced the five-year, $45 million D.C. School Choice Act to provide vouchers for up to 8,300 students in the D.C. Public Schools. New Hampshire Sen. Judd Gregg's new bill authorizes $55 million in vouchers in DC over six years.

 

Dateline: New Hampshire

 

House Bill 603 offers parents about $1,700 if they choose to withdraw their child from the public school in their community. This would apply to homeschoolers and any parent who removed their child from the public schools.

 

Dateline: Texas

 

A bipartisan group of legislators has  <http://64.4.30.250/cgi-bin/linkrd?_lang=EN&lah=c33dcfb99597b2aefc74643c3d3e89d2&lat=1049069642&hm___action=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2edallasnews%2ecom%2fopinion%2fviewpoints%2fstories%2f032403dnedilara%2ec8f27%2ehtml> proposed a pilot school choice bill , known as the Texas freedom scholarship program, to address both academic achievement and overcrowding problems in Texas public schools.  Large urban districts where a majority of students are educationally and economically disadvantaged qualify for the pilot program.

A few thousand kids here and there and pretty soon we are talking about real children and real competition.

Dear Jeb,
 
I hope Columba and you are doing well and are having a nice weekend. I wanted to follow up on the last email I sent you. Thank you for wanting to be involved in the National Day of Prayer and enhance the day. You are so kind to even take the time. I stopped by your office on Tuesday and asked Betty if I could see you or if she could tell me a good time to call you. She took my phone number for you. You are so busy that I thought I would try to explain why I wrote you about the capitol prayer service. Yes, I am over the state of Florida, as well as the National Area Leader for the Southeast Region of the US,  Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. It is a challenge that I love, but it is definitely a challenge.
 
Let me try to explain Shirley Dobson's heart and the purpose for the prayer services across the nation. She is the Chairman for the National Day of Prayer Task Force and Dr. James Dobson's wife. She believes that we should hold to our nation's heritage and that prayer should take place at the heart of our nation's government and at the heart of our state government and city government, which is why we hold prayer rallies at the nation's capitol that is attended by congressional leaders. The President hosts the prayer service at the White House. At the state level, since the state capitol is the seat of government, the governors and state leaders usually attended there, since it represents their state. Then there are rallies held throughout the nation at city halls, where the mayors and city and county leaders attend. We also hold rallies in other places for the community to come together to pray, such as in Daytona. The local government leaders usually attend the large evening rallies after they have attended their noon services. Across Florida there are hundreds of rallies, all of which are planned by local  volunteers. The reason I feel so strongly about you being at the capitol rally is that this is the customary tradition for what we would like to see happen for National Day of Prayer across the nation. The Capitol Rally represents prayer for the whole state, not just one city. Many of the governors attend their capitol rally and also pick a morning prayer breakfast or an evening community event, whatever works with their schedule.
 
Jeb, please feel free to go where your heart leads you to go. As stated above, we feel that the governor should attend the capitol rally, which represents the state he leads, however,  the choice is yours. We are thankful that you want to be involved in the National Day of Prayer. I will be fine with whatever you decide. If you happen to be in town and want to attend briefly at the capital, that would be great. If you want me to work with Tara to find a prayer service in a different city (none of which would be at noon because they are almost all city hall rallies), I will help find the right place for you, perhaps down south. If you need to discuss this further, please call me on my cell phone at 339-6190 anytime.
 
Thank you again, for your heart for prayer. Please say hello to Columba for me. I have requested (through Michelle) a visit with Columba sometime in the next couple of months and  hope she will be able to have the time. I miss her. May God give you both strength during these trying times. He is faithful! Have a wonderful week!
 
Blessings,
Pam

ISSUE 1.    Resolving Agricultural Issues (Acreage irrigated and Dry-Year Multiplier)

 

FIRST QUESTION:  What acreage is reasonably anticipated to be in agricultural production in the Flint River Basin in the near term and long term?

 

Context and significance of acreage issue

*	Agriculture is an important part of the Georgia economy
*	Currently Georgia has about 425,000 acres of active irrigated  farms in Flint Basin
*	The effects of this much farming are acceptable to Florida
*	Georgia says it “needs” 920,000 irrigated acres, perhaps more
*	This would substantially reduce flows to Florida
*	Need to determine how many acres it is reasonable to expect, in order to run models
*	Florida has agreed in principle to accept farm growth beyond 425,000 irrigated acres
*	Georgia’s “need: for 920,000 irrigated acres may be acceptable in years of abundant supply

 

What we know about existing acreage

*	About 425,000 acres according to the 1997 agricultural census
*	Georgia reports 620,000 acres permitted, so about one-third is fallow
*	Florida has used the 620,000 acre number in its models
*	Unimpaired data set has been built using actual acreages
*	All values can be confirmed based on:  Georgia permits; agricultural statistics

 

What we know about the future

*	Trends in acreage:  fairly flat, projected to decrease?
*	Trends can be confirmed from agricultural statistics
*	Projections should be reflected in various studies
*	Georgia claims there are pending and prospective applications for 300,000 more acres
*	Need to assess whether this is realistic or reasonable

 

Additional technical issues that the panel may raise

*	Type of crops (different water needs, dollar values)
*	Type of irrigation systems (modern systems need less water for same yield)
*	Source of water (acres supplies by ground water have smaller effect)

 




SECOND QUESTION:  What is an appropriate dry-year multiplier for irrigation in the Flint River Basin?

 

Context and significance of dry year issues

*	Yield, financial return benefit from more inches of water up to a point, especially in drought
*	But more inches of water have greater effects on Florida flows and fishery productivity
*	Using Georgia’s numbers, stateline flows are not protected
*	Florida’s numbers protect existing Georgia economy and allow for significant growth
*	Florida expects that as more acres are farmed, Georgia farmers should share in drought hardships
*	This drought sharing also is needed by Georgia to protect Flint River instream flows

 

What are the numbers?

*	Florida believes crops need 8 inches of water in normal years, 11 inches in droughts
*	Florida is using a drought multiplier of 1.4
*	Florida’s estimates are consistent or higher than Federal agency estimates
*	Georgia is seeking at least 18 inches of water in drought years
*	Georgia is using a drought multiplier of 2.2
*	Florida believes Georgia’s existing use is 8 inches on 425,000 acres = 253 MGD
*	Florida accepts drought use of 11 inches on 620,000 acres = 507 MGD 
*	Georgia’s stated need is 18 inches on 920,000 acres (or more) = 1232 MGD or more

 

Reasons for differences among States

*	Florida allows for growth in acres and the observed drought multiplier
*	Georgia uses even more growth in acres and a larger drought multiplier
*	Florida agrees to accept less 21%-31% stateline flow in dry years
*	Florida agrees to reduction in fisheries production in dry years
*	Florida restricts its own irrigation uses in droughts
*	Georgia proposes to increase its use of water in dry years

 

Relationship to Georgia instream flows

*	Georgia has a policy to protect instream flows
*	Georgia’s policy has recently become more stringent, but does not apply to agricultural permits
*	Georgia cannot allow unlimited irrigation and maintain instream flows
*	Georgia recognizes need to reduce irrigation during droughts, has established buy-out program
*	Florida believes Georgia’s proposed dry year multiplier is contrary to their instream flow policy
*	Applying Georgia’s own instream flow requirements to agriculture needs to be evaluated
*	If this is not done, how will Georgia protect its streams?
*	If this is done, Florida may have all the protection of its flows it needs
*	Florida will respect Georgia sovereignty as to how protections are implemented

 

Use expert panel to resolve additional issues (i.e. issues other than Georgia instream flows)

*	Start with quantifying irrigation use in normal years, then drought years
*	Use meter data where available, otherwise water budgets that depend on crop/system type
*	Consider power records as a supplemental data source
*	Consider whether there are trends that need to be taken into account
*	Determine whether to make any adjustment for water that is returned to the river




Expert Panel Process to begin to resolve agricultural issues

 

Independent Expert Panel to advise ACF Commission:

Three panel members, one from each state, with expertise in irrigation of row crops in the Southeast, agronomy, and agricultural economics

 

Timeline:

     One week:   Identify experts and provide relevant information

Two weeks:    Experts to review information and verbally report preliminary findings

Target date for verbal report:  (three weeks from 3/31 meeting)

*      Initial report may pose additional questions that need to be addressed

*      And/or identify data gaps that need to be filled

*      Ideally will resolve disputes to level needed to finish negotiations

*      At minimum, will narrow and better define the issues

 

Standalone investigation of instream flows by a 3-state modeling team:

     Need to evaluate Georgia’s proposed dry-year uses against Georgia’s instream flow requirements

     Determine whether agricultural uses create an instream flow problem in Georgia

     Assess how Georgia will address the instream flow issue

     Determine if limits imposed by Georgia on its own farms will be protective of Florida

     Integrate the result of the expert panel and modeling team

 




Sources of relevant information regarding the agricultural issues

 

Georgia has an active study to quantify farm water uses, including the multiplier

*	Some data already available

 

U.S. Geological Survey has an active study to quantify effects of well pumping on the river

*	Study delayed; may need to use prior research

 

The ACF Comprehensive Study has information

*	Information may be out of date
*	Need to coordinate with Georgia, get most up-to-date inputs for modeling

 

Extensive data are available from Federal agencies

*	National Resource Conservation Service 
*	National Agricultural Statistical Service

 

Extensive information is available from Georgia entities

*	There is a comprehensive river basin planning process
*	The 1997 Flint River Basin Plan has considerable information
*	Cooperative Extensive Service may be able to provide useful data
*	State is about to enact laws that substantially change nature of agricultural permits
*	This action reflects a number of studies and public processes
*	State has recently strengthened its instream flow policies
*	This action reflects studies and public processes

 

A number of university and stakeholder organizations have developed information

*	Flint River Planning and Policy Center, Albany State University has done many studies
*	The Southwest Georgia Water Task Force and its members give citizen perspectives

 

Power records showing variations in irrigation need may be available from energy sector

 




ISSUE 2.    State Line Flows (Quantity, Duration and Frequency)

 

Consistently accepting less than historic flows in exchange for predictability.

*            Florida agrees to meet long-term needs of Georgia, Alabama

*            And to accept “what is left over”

*            Florida will accept a modest decrease in flows to Apalachicola floodplain and estuary

*            To minimize decrease, agreement must require Georgia/Alabama to “play fair”

 

Ensuring variable flows across seasons and over time.

*            Florida specifies minimum flow requirements that vary seasonally

*            Nature will provide variability and flows above the minimums most of the time

 

Ensuring minimum flow requirements remain the “floor” and not operational targets.

*            The minimums are acceptable to Florida because they occur rarely

*            Cannot allow Georgia, Alabama or Army Corps to reach these values routinely

 

Ensuring shared adversity and shared abundance across all sectors.

*            During droughts, Florida has agreed to accept up to 31% less flow at the State line

*            This will reduce productivity and harvest in Apalachicola system

*            Florida expects Georgia and Alabama water users to share in the shortage hardships

 

Getting the incentives right:  distinguishing between natural and man-made droughts.

*            Drought conditions are predicted to occur about 4% of the time, using Florida assumptions

*            Georgia, Alabama suggest allowing water consumption to create drought 8% of the time

*            Florida does not agree to allow upstream water uses to “cause” droughts

 




ISSUE 3.    Term of the Compact

 

50 years of certainty for all parties

*            Has taken 13 years to get where we are

*            Must reap rewards of this work, by making commitments that will endure for decades

 

Immediate Benefits to Georgia

*            Georgia’s critical need -- securing long-term water for Atlanta, is achieved immediately

*            Most other needs of Georgia are fully secured from very beginning of agreement

 

Long-Term Benefits to Alabama and Florida

*            Over time, Georgia uses more and more water, reducing the safety margin downstream

*            Providing protections to downstream states thus becomes increasingly important over time

*            An agreement which can end in only a few decades accomplishes nothing for Florida

*            Only a long-term agreement satisfies the needs of all three States

 

Adaptive Management

*            Studies, scientific reviews, public input will improve our knowledge over time

*            Allowing beneficial changes in how the basin is managed

 

Adjustments via mutual consent

*            The changes arising from adaptive management will be implemented by consensus

*            Thus each State must commit to continued cooperation and good faith decisions

Re:        Additional inputs for Monday’s briefing andmeeting

 

After considerable thought, I have concluded that while convening the proposed expert panel is an important and valuable exercise, we should recognize the complexity of the task that the panel is being assigned, and we should consider the strategic value of a second issue, namely the protection that Florida may get from Georgia’s instream flow policies.  The inputs that follow are for your consideration as you advise the Governor.

 

First, as to complexity.  Quantification of irrigation use has been a dominant and controversial issue in every water dispute I’ve been involved in.  Indeed, in the current Republican River case, the settlement is now stalled because the downstream state (Kansas) has decided that the upstream state (Nebraska) did not calculate irrigation water use correctly.  I will be surprised if the expert panel does not end up with more questions than answers, and would be very cautious of promising a quick and definitive outcome from the group.  We need to focus the panel, as by starting with a quantification of existing uses in normal years, which are the basis of the existing economic value of agriculture.  Then, when the Governors understand that Florida is accepting a substantial growth in that use, and the conflict is because Georgia wants even more, the significance of the disagreements will be placed in a better context.

 

Second, as to strategery.  Based on numerous documents found on the Internet, Georgia cannot meet the “need” it has asserted and still maintain adequate instream flows in the Flint River.  There are very likely significant limits on the extent of permissible agricultural growth in Georgia that arise from Georgia’s own laws and policies, and it may be that those laws and policies if diligently applied would protect Florida fully.  Georgia does not want to address this internal conflict, because of the difficult political issues it raises, so I think we need to force the issue.  If Governor Perdue can understand that what Florida is asking for is what Georgia also needs for herself, the ability to achieve agreement may greatly improve.

 

So, I believe the priorities are:

     Quantify the existing use, i.e. the use needed to maintain the existing economy

     Quantify the acceptable use, i.e. the use that protects Florida’s hydrographs

     Quantify Georgia’s need for increased water in light of its instream flow requirements

     If Georgia’s real need exceeds the use accepted by Florida, negotiate a reconciliation

     The reconciliation would require equitable curtailments in all States during droughts

Dear Governor Bush,
       I am hoping you will be of assistance to me.  I have nowhere else to turn considering I cannot get any help from any one individual in the education area in Florida. 
       I am currently a Kindergarten teacher at Silver Shores Elementary School in Miramar, Florida.  Our principal is Ms. Rebeca Brito.  I cannot tell you enough how happy I am at this school and how happy I am being a teacher.  Unfortunately, I am having great difficulty trying to obtain my Professional Certificate.  My temporary certificate expires June 30, 2003.  I registered to take the K-6 subject area exam in January.  Unfortunately there was an enormous turnout and my registration was pushed into February for the supplemental testing.  This has set me back a month.  I took the test on Feb. 22.  I was very upset to find out that I did not pass by 12 points.  When I went to register for the April 19th test, I was told I would have to pay $165.00 just to take the test.  I proceeded to explain to the woman that the book I had been recently sent stated I had until March 20 to submit my application for testing.  She told me it was my fault for not keeping up on things regarding testing.  It did not matter that I had just received the book 2 months prior.  
       Needless to say, I have not been able to register over the phone because I cannot get through.  I have called the Bureau of Teacher Certification in Tallahassee and the Department of Testing in Tampa.  Both places informed me they cannot help me.  I have to continue to try and call to register for the April test.  I only have until April 4th to get through.  Since I am a full-time teacher, it is not the most easiest thing to do during the day when I am working with my children.  I could really use your help in securing my registration for the test.  And if you could put me in contact with someone who knows all about the testing and requirements for teachers.  
       I am sorry to bother you.  I know you are a very busy man and don't have time for little things like this.  But this is important to me because it means my job at a school that makes me very happy.
       I have spent a lot of needless time in college trying to take as many courses as possible to fulfill additional certificates only to find out that I did not need to take additional courses.  Since I had my Bachelors Degree, that would have been sufficient.  But I spent my money to expand my certificates.  Do you think you would be able to help me?

Thank you for your time,

Dear Governor Bush:

I have written to you before and realize you can't read and answer all the mail, but we have begged for help and I guess your aids don't think this issue is important.  To us here in Citrus County, Fl. its very important.  Our family members, loved ones and friends have been herded up like cattle and moved out of their loving home at River Oaks, Crystal River, Fl.  This move was done by the Dept. of Children and Family Services against the will of the residents and family members.  There was no warning this was going to happen, it was done in the way our troops have been ambushed in Iraq.  Aren't we better then that?

Judy Stouffer needs a heart.  She is the most rude, uncaring person I have ever met in the state of Florida.  She has it in for Dan Ward and is going to do anything in her power to close him.  She may not like him but that is no excuse to do what she did this past Friday March 28, 2003, and then stand there and smirk about it.  How rude!!!!

There was and is a hearing set for April 10th, 2003, why could she not have waited for the thirteen days and at least let Dan Ward and River Oaks Assisted Living facility have their day in court?  What was the rush?  Some residence had been there for six year, some three years, some fifteen months, why all of a sudden is it an emergency???

River Oaks residence have NO bedsores, there is NO dehydration, there is NO foul odor, the facility is clean, the residence are well fed, plenty of fluid, and an abundant amount of love.  Why close a facility like this??  I know these things to be true, my husband was a resident for 31 days, the month of July 2002, we have been back every week since that time to visit residence that have become our friends, staff, who are also our friends.

Please help stop the harassment at River Oaks, its uncalled for.

Sincerely,

Betty Rausch

Subject: Are Florida's Triplets Being Sent to Iraq


March 27, 2003

Dear Govenor Bush:

I heard today that the three orphaned triplet girls (Cristina, Jessica and Melissa Buchanan, )from Blountstown are possibly being sent to Iraq with the Florida National Guard, (144th Transportation Co.) .  I thought there was some rule that said that family members were not sent to the same area during a war in case an entire family or several family members might perish during war.  These girls say they want to stay together whereever they go, but I think the Army protocol should be followed.

These young women do not have the training to be on the front line in Iraq, from what I have heard. They are about 19, and just enlisted last year, I believe, if my memory is correct, hoping to get money for college after their mother died. They have only served in the National Guard (no prior military service) and that, to me, means training 1 weekend a month and a few weeks a year.  It would be a shame for three females from one family to die in Iraq, especially those who are not as skilled at war as our regular troops.  I do not know them personally but have seen them interviewed and fear for their safety.  Is there any way you can intervene and see if you can assure their safety, and also see if you can keep Florida's National Guard troops from being sent to the front lines before other more skilled seasoned regular enlisted soldiers?  Our Panama City Florida National Guard was sent over early, and I am sure they are well-trained, and are proud to serve,  but it would appear to me that enlisted regular Army and Marine units should be deployed first.  

Thank you for looking into this.

Sincerely,

Barbara Miner

Dear Governor Bush:

I had mentioned to you in my last e-mail that Michael and I would be 
participating in a Conference Call with Vantage, Intellitools 
(www.intellitools.com)and NCEO (National Center on Educational Outcomes) 
education.umn.edu/NCEO.  That call went VERY well and we are all excited 
about the possibilities for accommodating students with disabilities 
utilizing a Web-Based Assessment.  One of the outcomes of the call was a 
request from NCEO for a video depicting how a student with disabilities can 
access the assessment on a computer utilizing Assistive Technology.  

I would really appreciate just a few minutes of your time to video you with 
Michael, very much the same way you interacted with him during that first 
meeting on December 2nd of last year.  It would be such an honor to showcase 
Florida in the forefront of Web-Based Assessment!  Just let me know and I'll 
contact your scheduling department for a mutually acceptable time (anytime 
for us)!

Also, I am hoping that you can update us on the current status of the 
Web-based pilot with ESE students.  The initiative had moved very rapidly 
after our first meeting, but seems to have come to a screeching halt.  I am 
aware of the fact that Vantage has delivered a proposal to the DOE with an 
online  FCAT and that they are also currently working with Intellitools to 
develop an overlay and are very interested in bringing that application to 
Florida. 

I know that these things take time, but my enthusiasm, and the fact that 
Family C.A.F.E. is just around the corner providing an excellent opportunity 
to announce this pilot to the 5000+ family members and children in 
attendance, that I just hope that the pilot is still on your fast track.  :-) 

Looking forward to hearing from you soon regarding your approval to be 
videotaped with Michael.  Thanks for all that you do for ALL children in this 
state and especially your advocacy for our DD population.

From the Heart,

Karen

Subject:	SARS Advisory - all ports of entry WHO

ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Saturday extended its travel advisory for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome to include all of mainland China as well as Hanoi, Vietnam and Singapore. 
The CDC urged that anyone planning nonessential travel to mainland China and Hong Kong; Singapore; and Hanoi, Vietnam "may wish to postpone their trips until further notice." 
The CDC has been working closely with the World Health Organization to investigate the emergence of SARS, a deadly flu-like disease. Though a number of cases have been reported in Canada, the "CDC is not advising against travel to or from Canada because there is not evidence of widespread community transmission" there, the agency said in a statement. 
Earlier, CDC officials said that 51 suspected cases of SARS have been identified in the United States. Worldwide, a total of 1,550 cases and 54 deaths have been reported from 13 countries as of Saturday, according to the WHO. 
Hong Kong is the world's most severely affected area, with 58 new cases of SARS reported on Friday alone, according to The Associated Press. (Full story <http://www.cnn.com/2003/HEALTH/03/29/asia.sars.ap/index.html> .) 
CDC officials are meeting planes, cargo ships and cruise ships coming either directly or indirectly to the United States from China, Singapore and Vietnam and distributing health alert cards to disembarking passengers. 
The CDC will distribute approximately 25,000 health alert notices daily to people returning from the affected regions at more than 20 ports of entry. 
Officials are also assessing passengers returning from those areas for SARS symptoms, which include: 
• A temperature of greater than 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38.0 degrees Celsius) 
• Signs of respiratory illness, including cough, shortness of breath, difficulty in breathing, hypoxia (deficiency in the amount of oxygen reaching the tissues of the body), and X-rays indicating the presence of pneumonia. 
U.S. medical researchers say evidence is mounting that the cause of the illness is a previously unrecognized form of a virus related to the common cold. (Full story <http://www.cnn.com/2003/HEALTH/03/27/mystery.evidence/index.html> ) 
The CDC also issued recommendations to prevent transmission of the illness from people suspected of having the disease to their family members and other close contacts. These include limited exposure to the public and wearing surgical masks to prevent the spread of germs. The CDC said it is not clear how long a patient may be contagious. 
The recommendations were released the same day that Dr. Carlo Urbani, an expert on communicable diseases who was the first WHO officer to identify the outbreak in Vietnam, died of SARS. (Full story <http://www.cnn.com/2003/HEALTH/03/29/mystery.illness.doctor.ap/index.html> ) 

• What are the symptoms? The main symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) are high fever (greater than 38 C or 100.4 F), combined with a dry cough, shortness of breath, or breathing difficulties. Chest X-ray indicates changes compatible with pneumonia. Other possible symptoms include headache, muscular stiffness, loss of appetite, malaise, confusion, rash and diarrhea. • How contagious is SARS? SARS appears to be less infectious than influenza. Experts believe it spreads through close contact with an infected person, such as between family members or between patient and doctor. However, it is still unknown what sort of virus or bacteria causes the illness. Scientists are focusing on the coronavirus family, which causes common colds, although other possibilities are also being explored. The incubation period -- i.e. the length of time between exposure and symptoms emerging -- is estimated to range from two to seven days. • How is it treated? The best treatment is still unclear. Standard antiviral drugs and antibiotics do not appear to be effective although some patients in Hong Kong have shown favorable response to a cocktail of drugs including the antiviral drug ribavirin and steroids. • What can be done to prevent SARS? The illness can be severe but apart from the close contact with an infected patient is not thought to be highly contagious when simple protective precautions are taken. Health experts say it is important to maintain good personal hygiene and good ventilation in home and working environments. Washing hands with liquid soap and using disposable towels is recommended. Keeping windows open and putting on facemasks can also help prevent transmission of the infection. • Is it safe to travel? The World Health Organization (WHO) has not recommended travel restrictions for any destination in the world, although it says the situation is under constant review. Check their Web Site <http://www.who.int/en/>  for latest alerts and advisories. However, U.S. and Canadian health officials say travelers should consider postponing non-essential trips to areas at risk such as Hanoi, Vietnam; Hong Kong or Guangdong province in southern China; and Singapore. WHO recommends those who have symptoms related to SARS and have a recent history of travel to the affected areas seek immediate medical attention and inform health care staff of recent travel. • How many cases have been reported worldwide? 1,326 cases including 52 deaths have been reported from February 1, 2003 to March 26.

Subject: Randolph-Sheppard Program


Under the Federal Randolph-Sheppard Act the Florida Division of Blind
Services is required to conduct an assessment of Federal facilities within
the state to determine whether an opportunity exists for a blind vendor to
provide the food service and then attempt to acquire the contract.  In
August, we notified Patrict Air Force Base of our intention to bid on the
contract for food services when the contract came up for renewal on October
1, 2002.  We advised that we intended to retain all current employees.  The
food service contract is currently held by the Brevard Achievement Center
pursuant to the Federal Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act, which gives them a
preference over all competitors except a blind vendor bidding under the
Randolph-Sheppard Act.  For the past several years there has been a struggle
between those bidding under the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act and blind vendors
acting under the Randolph-Sheppard Act.  The Federal Courts have uniformly
ruled that the Randolph-Sheppard Act takes precedence under the system
devised by Congress.
As I understand it, the Brevard Achievement Center currently receives 9% of
the $1.8 million contract.The National Industries for the Severely
Handicapped (NISH) receives 4% for the cost of administering the program.
We were approached by a company named Food Services, Inc. From Gainesville,
Georgia last Sumer with a proposal to team with us in seeking Air Force food
service contracts.  They would do all initial work to identify contracts
coming up for renewal; would do all setup work; would assist in
negotiations; would provide free legal service in case of litigation; and
would train our blind vendor.  In return, our blind vendor agreed to a 3
year contract giving Food Services 40% of the profit, with Food Services
providing a guarantee of a $50,000 annual income for the blind vendor if the
60% share for the blind vendor amounted to less than $50,000.  After the
expiration of the 3 year `contract, the blind vendor could choose to go it
alone or negotiate a new contract with Food Services, Inc.  When Patrict Air
Force Base failed or refused to respond to my letters and phone calls, and
instead gave an extension of its contract to Brevard Achievement Center, we
sought and received approval from the DOE General Counsel's Office to file
suit in Federal Court seeking injunctive and declaratory relief.  That
action was filed and served `on Patrict approximately 2 months ago.
Until I received a phone call from Bill Ammons in the Governor's Office, I
had never heard of the Lakeview facility.  I have had no contact  with the
Pensacola Naval Base, nor has anyone else from the Division of Blind
Services.  Since then, I received a letter from Lakeview requesting that I
foreswear any attempt to bid for the contract at Pensacola.  I responded
that, while I could not assert that we would never seek the contract, we do
not intend seeking it for the forseeable future-probably at least 5 years.
I advised that to do more would be contrary to my responsibilities under the
Randolph-Sheppard Act.  I received a response that they appreciated my
disclosing our intent to seek to displace them and other similar facilities
in Florida and that they intended to ask the Governor to overrule me.  As I
stated previously, this is a national phenomenon.  All across the country
NISH is challenging the rights of blind vendors under the Randolph-Sheppard
Act and have been consistently told by Federal Courts that the
Randolph-Sheppard Act takes precedence over the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act.

Last week I delivered a speech to the Naples Rotary Club (150+ people) on the

The previous evening I spoke at the Florida Chapter of the North American

Subject: Front Porch Florida 

I copied you on an email last week to Alison Hewitt that has a few people down here in Tampa in a minor tizzy.  In the email, I was asking about some hold-ups in authorizations and releases of funding that are causing some problems for the Front Porch Florida group I work with here in Tampa, but they seem hesitant to push the envelope and make the system work for them.  Some people are afraid of "the system", imagine that!

Please understand that I sent this email independent of any action or request on their part, and they are now apprehensive that Front Porch Florida staff that they work with are going to "get in trouble" because I let you know about the problem.  I know better, of course.  I would bet that the hold-up has something to do with the consolidation of all the "stuff", to include OUO, under the Depratment of State, and that new bureaucracy is simply adapting to all of its demands.  Of course, here on the ground that period of adaptation can cause problems.

So, my point is that the Front Porch people here in Tampa are waiting, but happy to have the opportunity to wait.  If my attention to these matters is dysfunctional, please let me know.

Hawaii has introduce House Resolution 118, urging the superintendent and board of education to decline any further participation in NCLB and to return all Title I program money.  The legislation cites a state department fiscal study that indicates that NCLB would cost the department an additional $176.3 million for FY 03-04 and $260 million for FY 04-05 to carry out the purposes of the Act.  This is in addition to the $33.9 million received from USED for FY 02-03.  Below is a link to the bill summary and text.

Good Afternoon Governor Bush,

Last year I meet with Mr. Sharp regarding offering prescription coverage to
low income seniors throughout Florida. As I mentioned to Mr. Sharp, my
company CBG MemberHealth would like to donate 1000 free memberships for each
county in Florida. Our membership will provide members with discounts
ranging from 40% to 70% off their prescription drugs at virtually all drug
stores in our State. In addition to prescription discounts, we will also
provide vision discounts as well. Normally, we charge $60 per year per
household, so you can see that providing 1000 free memberships to all
counties is very substantial. I have been extremely busy with other projects
and I can now focus on this. I would like the support of your office and
help in determining who most needs our services. I also believe we can take
this offer nationwide. I am ready to support your administration with
regards to these issues and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thank you for your time

Dear Governor Bush:

My name is Michael Mansueto, I own a company called Consumers Group, Inc.
based in Ft. Lauderdale. We provide discount programs to consumers, unions,
small and large companies and associations. One of our most successful
programs is called CBG MemberHealth. CBG MemberHealth is a discount
prescription drug program offering discounts from 25 to 70% off at over
45,000 pharmacies nationwide. Our membership fee is $5 per month per house
hold.

I would like to work with your office by offering free memberships to senior
citizens who can not afford to purchase their life saving medication. I
would like to offer 100 free memberships per county over the next year, we
can start this immediately in Broward, Dade, Palm Beach and Monroe county. I
believe this would benefit a lot of people who can not get help anywhere
else, please call me at 954-453-2000 if you are interested.

Thank you for your time.

>Jennifer ‘s pulmonologist, Dr. Mario Rub, referred her to St. Louis Children’s Hospital for an initial evaluation on 12-11-01.  At that time she had <30% lung function.  She was placed on the lung transplant list 1-11-02 needing a bilateral transplant (dx. BPD).

>	1.	Where is Jennifer on the list?
>	2.	UNOS guidelines for lung transplants do not prioritize by medical condition
>	3.	No direct donations
>He is interested in raising the awareness of lung transplantation guidelines.
>Jennifer is currently stable at Miami Children’s (transferred out of ICU on Fri., 3/21/03).
>We relayed our concern to Mr. Hart, informed him that we are gathering information related to his daughter’s case, plan to speak with Dr. Sweet at St. Louis Children’s and that staff in this office will do anything we can to assist him.

>-Matching blood (typing and compatibility)
>-Time waiting

>He stated that his facility hasn’t rec’d offers (when offer is rec’d, the list is reviewed to determine how many other patients matched before Jennifer).  If she is in the grouping of patients considered, she would go to St. Louis to stay for approximately 3-6 months.
>She has been on the list 14 months and Dr. Sweet states that he expects she has several more months before organs become available.  He does not support moving the family to St. Louis prematurely because it would not be medically advisable since she is currently being managed appropriately in Fl. nor would it be financially feasible for the family.
>Dr. Sweet stated that there is no way to give Mr. Hart a listing for Jennifer because availability of lungs is very unpredictable.  Another option for Jennifer, per Dr. Sweet, is living donor transplantation and he states that the family has been encouraged to do this.

Clear Channel Cares:

Turning the Pages for Literacy Campaign

Clear Channel Jacksonville is proud to announce the creation of the Clear Channel Cares: Turning the Pages for Literacy Campaign, focused on creating awareness about illiteracy and finding solutions in our community through projects, events, and programs. Nearly 40 million Americans, and approximately 47 percent of the Jacksonville area’s adults, are functionally illiterate, meaning they cannot read beyond a 7th to 8th grade level.  

Josh McGraw, Clear Channel Jacksonville President, said, “As Jacksonville’s largest media company, we recognize and accept our responsibility to address issues that affect our community. This year Clear Channel Jacksonville will use the combined reach of our Television, Radio, and Outdoor properties to provide awareness of and solutions to the high percentage of illiteracy within our community through our ‘Turning the Pages for Literacy’ campaign.”

Each quarter, Clear Channel Television, Radio and Outdoor will dedicate its time and resources to literacy issues.  First quarter was dedicated to Much Ado About Books, the premiere literary event in the Southeast, which supports the Jacksonville Public Library system.  During the second quarter Clear Channel will support Learn To Read, Inc. a call to action for tutors in our community, and the Character Ball, which will raise funds for Learn to Read.  The third quarter focus will be Jax Reads, in which a book will be chosen for Jacksonville to read followed by a book drive.  In the fourth quarter, Clear Channel will team up with Volunteer Jacksonville for “A Visit From St. Nicholas”, dedicated to providing books, school supplies, and gifts to underprivileged schools.  Additionally, each quarter Clear Channel Television will produce and broadcast a half-hour program dedicated to literacy issues facing our community.

Susan Adams Loyd, Vice President and General Manager of Clear Channel Television (WTEV CBS47 and WAWS FOX30), said, “Illiteracy is a root problem in the greater Jacksonville area.  Not being able to read compounds many other social and personal problems.  Turning the Pages for Literacy will promote systematic change and provide resources at many levels.  It is a solution-based initiative.  Our entire staff is devoted to the effort.  We are committed to making a change in our community.”

Clear Channel Television will present Clear Channel Cares: Turning the Pages for Literacy by producing and airing Public Service Announcements (PSA’s), news coverage, website support, long format programming, and providing on-air talent and staff for literacy events.  Clear Channel Radio will produce and air PSA’s, news coverage, program and website support, and lend on-air talent and staff for literary events.  Clear Channel Outdoor will provide billboards across the community promoting various events and programs supporting the Turning the Pages for Literacy Campaign.

Rod Firestone, Clear Channel Outdoor Division President, said, “Jacksonville growth cannot begin until we learn how to fix our educational shortfalls.  Education cannot begin until people learn how to read.  A commitment to literacy demonstrates Clear Channel’s commitment to growth of our community.”

Clear Channel Television will air its first Clear Channel Cares: Turning the Pages for Literacy special program during the first week of April. The special will be broadcast twice on each station as follows:

	WTEV CBS47              Thursday, April 3 at 7:30pm 


	Sunday, April 6 at 1:30pm 

	WAWS FOX 30             Saturday, April 5 at 12:00 noon 


	Sunday, April 6 at 6:30pm

Subject: Reappointment of M-DCC Trustees, Hank Klein and Peter Roulhac

Dear Jeb,
 
I take this opportunity to reiterate to you that each of the seven board members you appointed to the M-DCC Board of Trustees has and continues to serve with the utmost commitment, integrity and purpose.  They are there for the College in every regard.
 
With regard to Hank Klein and Peter Roulhac, whose terms as trustees will expire as of May 31, 2003, I feel it is imperative that the College continue to have the benefit of their leadership, and I ask that you give serious consideration to reappointing each of them.
 
Hank Klein has been an invaluable trustee in his capacity as Vice Chairman throughout his tenure on the Board of Trustees.  The extraordinary leadership qualities and experiences Hank brings to the table are next to none; particularly, he has been an invaluable counsel on many complex real estate issues, thereby facilitating the College’s strategic planning in the area of facilities development and land acquisition.
 
Peter Roulhac has also served our Board and the College with immeasurable dedication and ambition.  He is a leader in his own right and very unselfishly yet ably performs his fiduciary responsibilities as a trustee.  Peter’s knowledge and acute sense of corporate and community affairs have served M-DCC very well; in the coming months, he will assume the chairmanship of the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce, which will inevitably have positive implications for M-DCC in terms of expanded opportunities for support and partnership collaborations.
 
Jeb, I know we can count on your usual consideration and informed action.  I am available to speak with you on this matter at your convenience.
 
Thank you.

Governor, My sincere regrets for missing your visit to GTMO.  I was in the
states on government travel and almost cancelled my trip to be able to
welcome you along with the GTMO community.  Although I was not able to meet
you, my husband had the opportunity to take a picture with you to forward to
our daughter in Summerville, SC.  She campaigned for President Bush and has
a picture with the President and wanted a picture of you.  As Florida
residents and voters, we are very proud of the work you and our President is
doing for our country.  You can be rest assured that when the time comes and
your are running for President of the United States my husband and I will be
casting our votes for you.  May God continue to bless and guide you and our
best wishes to you and your family.  Please, let President Bush know that
the GTMO community is behind him and we are praying for the Lord to be with
him.

Dear Governor,
I wanted to thank you for inviting us to participate in the Literacy Foundation benefit last weekend in Bonita Springs. It's a great cause, and we enjoyed ourselves tremendously.
Fenia was excited to meet you and your father, but positively thrilled to meet your mother, whom she has admired for years. She didn't even mind being wanded six times by the Secret Service agents ( I assured her that they didn't mind, either).
On a personal note, I must also thank you for your very gracious introduction of me at the luncheon and at the dinner. I am keenly aware of how sharply my columns can sting, and I certainly wouldn't have blamed you for taking the opportunity to fire back. Your restraint was admirable, and classy.
As everyone was, Fenia and I were both moved by Laura Calderon's words at the dinner presentation. If there is anything I can do to help raise awareness (or money) for your literacy program, please don't hesitate to get in touch. You can reach me after March 31 at elaphe@infionline.net , an e-mail I keep secret even from Tom Fiedler.
With best wishes,

Dear Governor Bush,

 

Please allow me to take a moment to thank you for a wonderful evening last Friday at the Celebration of Reading event in Bonita Springs.  It was a truly memorable event for an exceptional cause.

 

The Florida Literacy Coalition is proud of our affiliation with the Governor’s Family Literacy Initiative over the years.  I have seen first hand the tremendous difference that this program is having in the lives of parents and children throughout Florida.   

 

While our organization will no longer serve as fiscal administrator for this initiative,  I assure you that we will make every effort to continue to promote and support this program as we work with literacy programs throughout the state.     

 

Allow me to also take this time to share how much I have enjoyed working with Liza McFadden of your staff.  She represents you well and is very committed to promoting reading and mentoring throughout Florida.  

 

We look forward to having you join us for the ProLiteracy Luncheon next week in Orlando.

 

Thanks again for your ongoing support of adult and family literacy.

 

With warm regards,

 

Greg Smith

Executive Director

Florida Literacy Coalition

Thank you for having this event in Southwest Florida again.  Laurie and I were excited to be part of the host committee and proud to be associated with this event.

Having the opportunity to meet, even briefly, your parents was a privilege and we appreciate their participation in the event.  Our son (eight years old) was very excited to be able to hear your father (and you and your mother) speak.  The authors were (mostly)  a big hit with him also - of course, he grew up with Arthur, so hearing Mark Brown was fun.  But more exciting for him was to hear an excerpt from Hoot.  We bought Hoot for him when it first came out, but then after reading it ourselves, we concluded that he should be closer to 10 then 7 in order to read Hoot.  While he disagrees with his parents about that, at least he has now heard an excerpt and see the author.

Our son is a big Bush fan, having a photo of your brother on his poster board in his bedroom.

I was on our legislative update conference call (for the Real Property, Probate and Trust Law Section of The Florida Bar) with our consultant Pete Dunbar this morning and was sharing news about the event and the good work the Literacy initiative does in Florida with fellow members of that group around the State.  Keep up the great work.

Again, Governor, I thank you and your family and I look forward to seeing you again either in Southwest Florida or in Tallahassee.

Jeb - I cannot raise the kind of money Louise Courtelis did, but I have been 
on the UF Alumni Association board of directors for seven years and I would 
make a great trustee to replace her!  

I have been back stage enough to know what really goes on at UF.  If UF 
operated in a more business like fashion, it could handle the budget 
constraints and still produce the education we have come to expect from her.

Benji Brumberg was in Naples this past week addressing my Rotary Club and 
then on to the Conservancy of SW Florida.  Benji was shocked at the caliber 
and quality of the audience he had.  We had a small group with slightly more 
than 100 business leaders.  Benji really did a great job.

I was sorry to learn from Tara Wainwright you were not available for the 
Rotary District Conference on either May 9th or 10th.  You would have had an 
audience of 500-600.  I do have a US Senator and US Congressman both asking 
for an invitation if you were not available.  It will not be our first choice 
but still in keeping with the caliber of the other speakers.

Good luck with the rest of session.  Kill SB 666!  It is just plain bad 
legislation, bad for our state and I believe bad for you.  I believe God gave 
it the number it has to help it stand out for what it truly is.  I also 
believe, because of this bill, we have been given a warning about Ken Pruitt. 
 If given too much power (i.e., Senate President) it would be a bad thing.  I 
asked God to give me a sign if I should fight this bill that I knew was 
coming.  It had not been numbered yet!  There is no doubt in my mind why it 
got 666.

Have a good week.  Glad that the Bonita event went so well with your parents.

Subject: Tornados in Miami




 
Governor,
 
As I am sure you are already aware that on Thursday evening around 6:00 P.M. a tornado (or tornados) ripped through Miami-Dade County leaving one person dead (confirmed), many injured, and  four homes "totaled  with  property damage estimated at between $3 million and $4 million.  About 30 homes suffered heavy damage, with another 100 or so receiving limited damage.  One tornado was tracked from Liberty City through to Highlands Lakes Boulevard and neighborhoods to the northeast.   
 
Volunteer Florida, lead agency for Volunteers and Donations for the State Emergency Response Team, was activated in response to the tornados.  Over the weekend we deployed the Christian Contractors Association and the Florida Conference of the Southern Baptist to assist in covering up homes that have sustained roof damage and to remove fallen trees from resident yards.  Both groups are Support Agencies for Volunteer Florida.
 
The Christian Contractors Association was on site with three teams Sunday morning.  By Sunday afternoon they had put plastic sheeting on more than 20 homes.  This will help prevent subsequent damage from rain until repairs can be completed.   The Florida Baptist will be sending additional teams on Tuesday and Wednesday as they go block by block to cover homes damaged by the storms..     
 
Catholic Charities, Church World Service, and other FRIEND (Florida Regional Interfaith Emergency Network in Disaster) participants are helping to rally volunteer force and identify donated protective materials.  
 
The Florida Conference of the United Church of Christ and the Lutheran Disaster Response Team Florida/Lutheran Services Florida  are providing financial assistance to faith based organizations assisting in this event. 
 
Volunteer Florida staff, Merrilee White, flew to Miami yesterday  to help coordinate and assist agencies working this event.    
 
It is unlikely that there will be a federal declaration for this event, consequently the contribution made by volunteers is even more critical.
 
Will keep you posted, 
 
Fred

PS...I hired one of your best and brightest, Stacey McMillian. She worked for Kim B (STO) as the legal director for the Digital Divide Council.  I have her working w/ Wendy on OneFlorida/ Michigan response issues.  

P.S.S. I am spending a lot of time thinking about the FCAT and how we can deal w/ the failing seniors.  I am convinced that we can make this work.  While many students may not pass the test, and thus may not receive high school diplomas, my focus is on how can we keep those students inspired to learn...I believe we must do our best to keep them focused on succeeding despite failing the test.

I really think this is where YOU come in....we should work on incentive plans for the young adults that may not pass the test and make sure they and their parents know they have options---Perhaps , YOU could/can engage corporations to give the students summer jobs, if they enroll in special classes for the FCAT or GED, perhaps we can have our community college offer more incentives for the students etc........WE MUST FIND A WAY TO MAKE SURE THE STUDENTS FEEL GOOD ABOUT THEMSELVES AND THEIR CONTINUED EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE/SUCCEED....WE MUST CELEBRATE AND SUPPORT THOSE THAT DECIDE TO NOT GIVE UP...WE MUST SHOW WE BELIEVE IN THEM AND THEIR INNATE ABILITIES...WE MUST FOCUS ON CONVINCING AS MANY STUDENTS AS WE CAN TO NOT GIVE UP. 

I am here for you,

Hello-
I thought this might be the appropriate time to send to you my education research to you. I wrote a paper that has since been taken up with CEPRI.  I brought my findings and ideas to my CEPRI committee and it's grown from there.  I have met and worked with an amazing educator and I think his philosophy or approach if you will on education coincides with yours and he has methods that I think could really make a difference in Florida.  Also, I read an Associated Press article the St. Augustine newspaper Sunday regarding the Presidents' retooling of vocational education and it really fits with what I have found to be true.
 
If this is something you are interested in reviewing and if it's the right time to send it, should I e-mail it to you? If you are interested, I would be happy to share this research with you and discuss it with the appropriate people.
 
Thank you for your concern regarding CEPRI.

School alumni Veterans who have lost theirs lives while a member of the Armed 
Forces serving our country.  Our nephew Airman Joseph Rimkus was among those 
from Eglin Air Force Base who was murdered by terrorist when his barracks 
were bombed.  Those Khobar Towers terrorists have yet to be apprehended.
    Joseph's mother, Bridge Brooks would like very much to permanently loan a 
special portrait of Joseph to Crestview High School and dedicate it at the 
memorial service. It is special because President Bush signed it when he 
visited Eglin AFB February 4, 2002 shortly after the 9-11 bombings. You were 
there, and you smiled very kindly at Bridget and me. It was truly a special 
experience as Angels played a huge part in making this meeting possible.  
After the visit to Eglin I wrote to President Bush telling him of the Angel 
and also sent him a copy Joseph's picture with his signature now included. I 
also sent a list of all the people who have signed it.  The list includes 
President Bush, President Clinton, Governor Lawton Chiles, Senator Connie 
Mack, Congressman Joe Scarborough, General Shaliskasvilli, to name a few. 
    Since 1996, I have limited photos of this historic portrait to one local 
Crestview paper and insisted the picture of it be from a distance and that 
they destroy the negative. I do not want just anyone to have a copy...I have 
had to consider copies in flames on the streets of hostile middle eastern 
countries since the time President Clinton first signed it. I will require 
future photos be taken from a distance and that it not be copied or 
electronically scanned. I am very protective of it.
    I know President Bush received my letter and Joseph's picture as he wrote 
me a personal letter back.  The Angels timing of the President return letter 
was so profound, I received it the day of my Dads funeral, exactly one week 
after he died on July 21, my 42 birthday.  The Presidents letter to me was 
dated July 17, the very last day I ever talked to my Dad, the very day he 
slipped into a coma, which he never recovered from.  
    The reason I am writing to ask your advice, quite frankly, is to seek 
guidance as to releasing a copy of Joseph's picture. Media will be present 
and in today’s climate, this release is bound to cause a stir. The story will 
be told as well, I will no longer control it. I am sure it will be a positive 
story for President Bush. I am an experienced speaker and excellent 
speechwriter. For me, it is a deeply personal story.
    To get to the point Governor Bush, I just really need thumbs up from the 
President about releasing this photo and sharing the Angel story that caused 
us to meet.  
    To add even more consequence to my actions I also have to consider my 
Dad, the Late Dr. Edward O’Donnell has been nominated for the Medal of 
Freedom with Distinction, and well, this is bound to come out to the media 
too. It all intertwines. I really do not want to screw up his chances of 
getting this medal, he earned it, and he deserves it. Sir, I just deeply 
respect President Bush. We are now at war, hopefully rooting out the 
murderers that killed my nephew. My husband and Joseph's mom play a huge role 
designing the very weapons we are using to the win the war against Sadaam and 
terrorist.  Dad made sure we would mightily win any war we might face. Surely 
you can understand my hesitation. If it is okay with all concerned, I would 
love to share the enchanting story of the Angles, President Bush, and our 
family at the memorial dedication in Crestview.  I actually think it will be 
quite helpful to President Bush, I believe he is beloved more than any 
President in recent history is. I am very sure this story will help cement 
this love between America and her historically great People's President.  
    I have yet to return the call to the school regarding this effort however 
they do know about the picture because Joseph's mom discussed it with them.  
Our future plan is to offer the first original for permanent loan to the 
Pentagon, the second original my original copy with the new signatures to 
Eglin Air Force Base, and permanently loan both the Florida State Capitol and 
Crestview High School a copy as well. We would like very much to gain your 
signature and Congressman Millers too if at all possible.  Perhaps you and 
Congressman Miller might consider attending the memorial dedication in 
Crestview as well and sign Joseph's picture at that time.  I would love to 
explain the significance of the Angels and tell you the entire story.  It is 
real, it did happen. Our Congressman knows some of it.  It is amazing. It 
happened just like the Angles told me it would with President Clinton too.  
Also, the very same Angel guided me through the process of getting the 
Resolution HR200 to pass in the United States House of Representatives, in 
three months!  A sure sign of heavenly intervention as that rarely happens in 
our Government. 
    It only could be that same Angel who lined up historic events like 
dominos. The day before HR200 was introduced in the US House National 
Security Committee meeting and passed unanimously, my Dad received a Citation 
from the United States Navy thanking him for his historic efforts developing 
the National Defense of our Nation and for his direct help in winning the 
Cold War. This Citation was from Admiral Nanos. And presented to him at the 
Navy Headquarters directly across the street from where the National Security 
meeting was!  I was able personally attend and view both historic and 
extremely significant events.  The very next week Joseph's mom and I traveled 
back to Washington DC and stayed in the Generals Quarters at the Air Force 
base and watched HR200 pass in the United States House of Representatives. 
Members of the Air Force escorted us from the Pentagon. A variation of HR200 
passed in the US Senate in 2001. 
    Did you know Governor Chiles proclaimed June 25 as Airman Appreciation 
Day in Florida?  I have a signed copy of the proclamation. 
    I am copying my personal copy of the Resolution HR200 for display at the 
high school and if you would like, I would send you a copy of it too in the 
snail mail. I have never shared this entire story to the general public. 
Although I must say, when I tell partial tid bits, people always get excited 
and want to hear more. This time I am sure these uncanny events surrounding 
me will not go unnoticed. 
    It's a heavy load for me to bear worrying about our President. His 
Blessings for releasing the copy of the portrait and telling the story behind 
it would be most welcome.  Might you be able to offer some guidance to me?  
Again, I am uneasy speaking to the media without President Bush at least 
knowing I am going to do so in advance.  Again, I must reiterate, President 
Bush and his Blessings would bring me peace of mind. I will be forced to 
respond to Crestview High School and Joseph's mom very soon.
    Thank you very much for considering all of this.  I prayed and prayed 
about this and writing to ask for your insight was the answer I received.
With Highest Regards. Blessings to you.
Sincerely,
Mrs. Dari Bradley

Respectfully Gov. Bush,
I fully support your plan to downsize and streamline the State government.  This is a process I was very much successfully involved with for many years with the City of Tallahassee.  Over the last couple of years, I have seen many State agency (FDOT, in particular) changes.  I totally believe that it is time to also provide the incentives through bonuses or pay increases, for those individuals taking on more and exceeding expectations.  Unfortunately, I have not seen any move towards providing these type of incentives.
 
If you need a volunteer to serve on a citizen committee to assist with putting together a consistent and fair plan, I’d be happy to serve.  On January 26, 2003 the Tallahassee Democrat (surprise) had a nice article on what President Bush was doing along these lines.  It’s a great idea and works as I personally experienced managing over 50 people while employed with the City.  I’m a little bit on the slave driver side and returned again to the private sector!
 
Best to you and your family always,

Mr. Governor,
Thanks for the compliment on the set.  Without the great team I have working with me, it would not happen.
 
Medicare tells me she does not meet the requirements, since she does not need "injectable" medication which requires in-home care.  She has total assets under $40,000.
 
Thanks for the response - see you at next year's Celebration of Reading!

Subject: Celebration Of Reading


Dear Governor Bush,
 
Last Friday evening, I had the extreme honor of joining you and your distinguished parents at the annual Celebration of Reading.   This was the third year I have had the opportunity to be a small part of the event - by providing the design, props, sets, and installation of the decorations sponsored by my place of employment, Walt Disney World.   I hope to continue to be a part of this fine event for years to come.
 
It was not the time or place to talk to you about anything else but your Literacy Program.   All I am asking is for you to continue to push for the continued medical care for our elderly citizens.   In the time since last year's Celebration of Reading, my Mom has suffered a slight "stroke" that has not affected her mobility or health, but her short term memory.   My vibrant, lover of reading, lover of projects is now lost in a world of what is happening now.   She remembers our family and days gone by, but not what we talked about five minutes ago.   While Mom was in the hospital, her nurse and doctor told me to make arrangements for a nursing home for my Mom, because she was no longer able to care for herself.  That is not an option.   When I was born and my father left, Mom did not abandon me, and now that she needs me I will continue to care for her forever.
 
Mom came home with me, and we are now together in "our" house.   However, because of the care Mom needs, I must provide a caretaker / nurse for her while I am not home.   We have a wonderful caretaker, and have been blessed with her.   She was provided through the Grannie Nannies company.   We are doing great and Mom's health is strong.
 
The reason I am letting you know and asking you to continue for Elder Medical Care, because each week, we must pay over $500.00 for the care - ands while I am only bringing home $400.00 - well, you can see my point.   I have had to begin selling Mom's furniture and house to make ends meet.   Medications are over $125.00 per month.   All this, and Medicare has denied any help to us.  We are on our own and we will make it through the grace of God.
 
Please help all the other elder citizens of our great state.   My Mom and I have the chance to make it ourselves, but some have nothing.   For them, please do whatever you can.
 
May God bless you, the great state of Florida and the United States of America.
 
Sincerely,
 
Patrick Logan
 
NOTE:   During dinner at the Celebration of Reading, I gave the President (your father) some tags we are suggesting to use for raising funds for the families of our troops overseas.   One side has your name and the other says "I Support The President of the United States."   Hope you received yours, if not, I will be happy to send you another.

Hi Jeb -- glad you enjoyed the event, too!  I think it was the best yet and gives us something to "top" next year. :)  Hope you saw the great media coverage ... it's gratifying to see your family literacy message coming through.  That makes it all worthwhile.  Thanks for letting me be involved.  (And at least I know I'll see you once a year!)

Governor-
Last year you were nice enough to meet with the fifth grade class from Seven Rivers Christian School at my request. Now they have asked if they can do so again. They still talk about how great it was to meet you. They even had your picture with them appear in the paper. 

When they called I told them I really couldn't help. That last year it just worked out. If you were interested, and thought you might be able to meet with them, they will be here April 23, 24 & 25. They would love the chance.

That being said, I did not commit you in any way. Thanks again for the chance to serve.

Paul
