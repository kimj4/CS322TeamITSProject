Mr. Bush,

I am writing you as a republican constituent- one who voted for you in
the last election- and as one who is dissatisfied with the current
dismemberment of Florida’s schools under your administration. To the
point: the siphoning of public school funds- at the federal and state
level- to irresponsible and negligent charter schools and/or private
schools. In Hillsborough alone- the district in which I reside- there
are four charter schools that violate the separation of church and state
by teaching religious studies with government funds.

I do not debate that the current public school system has flaws- but
what I do debate and take issue with is the notion that private
companies (corporate America) would do a better job- their number one
priority being the bottom line- than those public school officials
already in place. The government- run and supported by the constituents-
has a greater investment in the future of our children than Joe CEO and
his stockholders.

Please, focus tax dollars where they belong- to public schools, to
teachers, to students.

Thank you for your time,
Kathleen Paulus

Governor: I met with Senator Fasano yesterday. He supports caps on non
economic damages if there is language in the legislation that will
require roll back of premiums. We discussed the need to improve or solve
the "bad faith" issue. He now understands the importance of "bad faith"
in lowering rates. He is willing to support 'bad faith" reform. The PBF
phone calls have stopped to Senator Fasano. Senator Bennett is opposed
to caps. He lectured me on the issue. He told us that the FMA position
on caps is a disservice to physicians. He states that caps will not
lower rates and that we should be working on tort reform. Caps he said
will harm elderly people throwing the AARP under the bus. He expressed
his displeasure about the PBF phone calls in his district. He became
rather excited or agitated the more he spoke and then asked me to leave.
The phone calls continue in his district. Your editorial in the Miami
Herald is outstanding. Steve West

Jeb;

Necesitamos decidir sobre esto para planear el programa de verano.  Se que
te reuniste con puertorriqueños del área de orlando que te expresaron su
preocupación sobre los estudiantes que no hablan inglés y no se podrán
graduar o serán retenidos. El programa de santillana Intensive English ha
tenido mucho éxito en Orlando. Yo le enseñé a Liza los resultados de la
evaluación del proyeco federal LEE/READ donde los estudiantes mejoraron sus
niveles en FCAT significativamente. Bajo Title III de la ley NCLB, el
departamento de educación tiene alrededor de 2.9 millones de dólares que va
a usar para estudiantes LEP. Este dinero pudiera ser usado para este
programa de verano. Los planes al momento son de repartirlos a traves de
propuestas competitivas. Mi experiencia con estas propuestas es que se
utiliza el dinero para programas inefectivos. Debemos asegurarnos que se
usa para programas como el proyecto READ que ha demostrado ser efectivo en
varios distritos escolares. Por ejemplo en Broward, los estudiantes del
proyecto REAdD que usaron Santillana Intensive English excedieron sus notas
en el FCAT contra los que no participaron. Como te expliqué cuando íbamos
al aeropuerto, en dos años de participar en el programa, la mayoría de los
estudiantes del tercer grado subieron su nivel en el FCAT de nivel 1 al 3.

Si necesitas que yo vaya a Tallahassee a reunirme contigo, avísame. También
si vienes por Miami, nos podemos reunir para enseñarte las estadísticas y
mi propuesta para el programa de verano.

Cariños,

Arnhilda

Dear Governor:  
In the grand scheme of things,  this may not seem like a big deal to you but 
maybe there is someone you can refer me to.
My employer, Aldo Lombardo,  donated money to your campaign and your brothers 
and is a staunch Republican.  
His son Scott is a straight A student and has worked so hard to excel in 
middle school so he would be chosen to attend Suncoast High School.  This has 
been his dream and he has worked so hard for so many years for this.  This is 
a very good magnet program here in Palm Beach County.  Scott is not your 
"normal" student.  He spends all of his time in his books,  volunteering with 
the National Honor Society and doing whatever it takes ti stay on top of his 
class.  Yesterday he found out he was not chosen for Suncoast.  What is 
appauling to me is that kids were chosen thru a lottery.  There are kids with 
lower grades than him who got in.  And there were kids who didn't care if 
they got in or not who got in.  I think this sends a horrible msg to our kids.
My son Alex is straight A's in 5th grade now.  I certainly would love him to 
go to Suncoast and I would hope it would be based on grades,  attitude,  
ambition,  etc and not on luck.
Please,  if there is anything you can do for Scott Lombardo,  it would be 
greatly appreciated.

Jim, on April 30th Paradise Golf/ Outback Steakhouse will sponsor a Charity
Golf Tournament with 100% of the proceeds going to the families of our
soldiers killed in action in Iraq. It is our goal that we create a ground
swell and a grass roots campaign that will start a run of these types of
events all over the country. 

By comparison, the average family of a victim of 9/11 will receive
$1,185,000 while a family of a soldier killed in action will receive a one
time fee of $6000 , $1750 for a military burial, $833 per month until the
spouse remarries , and $230 per month for children until they turn 18 years
of age.  

One of our golf courses in Paradise Golf ( West Chase CC ) is donating the
golf course and Outback Steakhouse is donating the dinner. Clear Channel
Radio stations in Tampa will help us spread the word. Our goal is to invite
the families of our fallen soldiers to attend the dinner. We are hoping to
get General Swartzkopf to attend , but haven't checked his schedule yet.  

You are probably wondering why I am emailing you this info. Well it is
because I thought with a little luck we may be able to get the Governor to
participate in this event. Or  do you have any other suggestions or
thoughts. This is such a great cause !! BH

I'm actually having a very good time and, as of yesterday, we have three very smooth elections behind us. Lots of hard work and many nuances to manage - but that's good. And, there is much we can do here. Things are well under control and seem to be going remarkably well.  The staff is adjusting well - and we laugh together a lot.  Nice, steady improvement. 
Mayor Iorio hired the chief of ops of the office as her Chief of Staff a couple of days after the election on March 25, but I have what I think will be a very good replacement - worked recently for Gen. Franks.  
I look forward to talking with you.

Subject: Standardized testing


Dear Governor Bush,
I have recently taken a college course regarding the foundations of our 
educational system and one of the topics we discussed in detail is that of 
standardized testing. I have concerns about whether these tests are the best 
way to evaluate a students comprehensive understanding and critical thinking 
ability of standard subjects such as English, Math etc.  

Standardized tests have been around for centuries. I remember taking such 
tests as a child ,however, I do not recall that these tests have been weighed 
so heavily on advancement.  Students were never retained do to a score on a 
multiple choice test. Now,  this seems to be the main deciding factor on if a 
student will be advanced to the next grade or even allowed to graduate. These 
tests that supposedly measure important skills fail to measure the type of 
skills that would be crucial in today's society.  For instance, I recently 
read an article regarding a student that could solve a fractional subtraction 
problem with ease, however, the child could not recognize that 3/6 and 1/2 
were equivalent.  I agree it is important for students to show competency in 
solving problems, but if the he or she can not recognize equivalent values how 
will he or she be successful in an occupation that requires this type of 
skill. How can these tests accurately measure growth or success in students 
that really do not try their best on these tests or even better yet what about 
students that have test taking anxiety? These types of testing are limited on 
how accurately they reflect a students understanding. They do not enable to 
student to interrelate parts of the text and do not require the student to 
give justification for his or her answer.  Suppose you have a dog, tree, bird 
and a cat. Which one does not belong? You may very well think tree because the 
other three items are animals. When I asked my son this same type of question, 
he told me the dog. His reasoning was that the bird and cat can go into the 
tree but the dog can't. If the correct answer was tree, he would have been 
marked wrong even though his answer is valid. If he had been allowed to give 
justification for his answer he would have got it correct. This small example 
shows how little these multiple choice tests measure.

I believe there are alternative types of measuring tools available. One such 
example is that of performance assessments. I believe the teacher should be 
the one evaluating a child not a test. In these assessments the student does 
something: design and conduct an experiment, speak a foreign language, write a 
play etc.. These types of activities allow the student to portray more or what 
he or she knows and in some cases what he or she does not know.  As a parent, 
I would much rather choose this type of assessment. After all, it more 
effectively measures the skills that will be most important to  a child when 
he or she takes their place in society.  

Sincerely,
Melanie Chorvat

Dear Governor Jeb,

Thank you for organizing the meeting for me with The Secretary of Health in Talahassee.  I am travelling today from San Diego to meet with him tomorrow.  Here is a part of what I will present to him and how it affects not only 30,000 dialysis patients in Florida, but also the general population of Florida as any of us could be suspected of having primary hyperparathyroidism.

Today, I will send you the presentation book that I have sent to the Secretary of Health with 5 allegations (below is the one that affects the general population).  I am doing this to protect patients and the general population.  I understand that there are freedom of information laws in Florida, but I would ask if you could help that the information that I send does not become passed to the parties I am accusing as it would hinder investigations in providing them an opportunity to build whatever defense they could muster.

Thank you for your help,

What Nichols Did When They Changed the 

Normal Reference Range of The BioIntact PTH Assay

1.  Important information has been gained from the Spectra March 6, 2003 memo.



2. Nichols is the market dominator for PTH tests and their parent company, Quest Laboratory is the market dominator for the clinical laboratory service of detecting primary hyperparathyroidism disease.

3. The normal reference range of the Nichols BioIntact PTH assay is used 
(a) as a basis for sending non-uremic patients suspected of primary hyperparathyroidism to surgery and 
(b) to calculate the dose of the potent vitamin D analog Zemplar to be administered to renal dialysis patients.

4. The lower the normal reference range the greater the diagnostic sensitivity to accurately detect primary hyperparathyroid disease.  In 2000 a comparison was made between an old Nichols intact PTH test with a high normal reference range of 10-65 pgm/ml and a competitor with a lower normal reference range.  The Nichols test accurately detected only 72% of the patients, whereas the competitive product with the lower normal reference range detected 96% of the patients.



5.  Nichols & Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard determined the normal reference range of the BioIntact PTH assay and published it in the 2001 Endocrine Society abstracts as 13-55 pgm/ml.

The 2001 Endocrine Society Nichols/Harvard abstract with the 13-55 pgm/ml normal reference range finding:



6. Nichols & The National Institutes of Health (NIH) & The University of California at San Francisco further determined the BioIntact PTH normal reference range & published it in the 2001 Endocrine Society Abstracts as 13-55 pgm/mL.

The 2001 Endocrine Society Nichols/NIH/University of California at San Francisco abstract with the 13-55 pgm/ml normal reference range finding:





7.  In the one year time period from the 2001 Endocrine Society published abstract findings of 13-55 pgm/ml normal reference range findings of Nichols, Harvard University, National Institutes of Health and the University of California at San Francisco to the next 2002 Endocrine Society published abstract findings it is reasonable to suspect that there was no change in the BioIntact PTH test.

8. During that one year time period from the 2001 Endocrine Society published abstracts to the 2002 Endocrine Society published abstracts there was a publication reporting a new PTH assay which competitive to the Nichols BioIntact PTH assay.  The publication was Gao P, Scheibel S, D’Amour P, John MR, Rao SD, Schmidt-Gayk H, Cantor T. “Development of a Novel Immunoradiometric Assay Exclusively for Biologically Active Whole Parathyroid Hormone 1-84: Implications for Improvement of Accurate Assessment of Parathyroid Function” J Bone Miner Res 2001;16(4):605-614.  This publication reported that the new PTH assay had a lower normal reference range of 5-39 pgm/ml (compared to the Nichols BioIntact PTH assay normal reference range of 13-55 pgm/ml).  This publication demonstrated that this lower normal normal reference range of 5-39 pgm/ml had a smaller overlap with primary hyperparathyroid patients than would have been expected from the Nichols normal reference range of 13-55 pgm/ml.  Therefore, this new PTH test with the lower normal reference range of 5-39 pgm/ml had a superior diagnostic sensitivity for primay hyperparathyroidism over the Nichols BioIntact PTH test with a normal reference range of 13-55 pgm/ml.

The lower normal reference range for the competitive assay was:






9. If the original Nichols BioIntact PTH normal reference range found and published by Nichols, Harvard, NIH and UCSF is correct at 13-55 pgm/ml then the BioIntact PTH test would be of inferior diagnostic sensitivity to the competitor with the lower 5-39 pgm/ml normal reference range as can be seen from the following:




10. If the original Nichols BioIntact PTH normal reference range found and published by Nichols, Harvard, NIH and UCSF is correct at 13-55 pgm/ml and the BioIntact PTH test was misclaimed as having a normal reference range of 6-40 pgm/ml then those NORMAL (from the normal non-uremic general population) subjects (potentially >10% of the normal population) with PTH values between 40-55 pgm/ml might potentially be missclassifed for surgical removal of a hyperparathyroid adenoma * as can be seen from the following:






11.  Following the publication of the competitive assay with the new lower normal reference range of 5-39 pgm/ml (Gao P, Scheibel S, D’Amour P, John MR, Rao SD, Schmidt-Gayk H, Cantor T. “Development of a Novel Immunoradiometric Assay Exclusively for Biologically Active Whole Parathyroid Hormone 1-84: Implications for Improvement of Accurate Assessment of Parathyroid Function” J Bone Miner Res 2001;16(4):605-614) Nichols and Dr. Ketelslagers published a revised lower BioIntact PTH normal reference range of 6-40 pgm/ml.





12.  A routine derivation of a normal reference range does not normally constitute the level of scientific interest that would warrant a pre publication abstract.  Publishing an "abstract" does gain the lowest threshold for acceptance for publication into a credible journal as abstracts typically have no or minimal peer review.

13. These 2 conflicting Nichols' publications now leave the essential question to be answered:

Which of the 2 publications of Nichols is correct?  Is the original 13-55 pgm/ml normal reference range as found and published by Nichols, Harvard Univeristy, National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the University of California correct or is the revised lower 6-40 pgm/ml normal reference range as found and published by Nichols and Dr. Ketelsleger correct?  It is reasonable to expect that the question of whether the 13-55 pgm/ml or the 6-40 pgm/ml is correct would be best answered by an objective, unbiased, independant evaluation in which Nichols does not participate.


14.  Notice how Nichols claims in their own advertisement that there is an increase in parathyroidectomies.  A falsely lower normal reference range claim could explain an increase in parathyroidectomies * (see item 10 above).   There are 50,000 new cases of primary hyperparathyroidism diagnosed each year in the USA.  Notice how Nichols has benefited financially from this increase in parathyroidectomy surgeries by an increase in sales of the Nichols BioIntact Intraoperative Assay:



15.  Nichols placed in their BioIntact PTH package insert the highly unusual reference to the nationality of the subjects used to derive the lower normal reference range.  There is no published differences in PTH values between American and Belgian people.  If a another laboratory in the USA could not reproduce the new lower reference range of 6-40 pgm/ml the Nichols nationality reference might cause one to wonder if there is a difference in PTH normal reference ranges between Belgians and Americans. 





16.  Quest Laboratory, the parent of Nichols provides to its laboratory customers the new beneficial lower normal reference range:




17. Quest Lab, the parent of Nichols, immediately capitalized on the new lower normal reference range claim by highlighting the BioIntact PTH assay on their home page for several months.  Moreover, Quest Lab has used the phrase "superior diagnostic sensitivity for primary hyperparathyroidism" (which was made possible by the new lower normal reference range) and the fact that the BioIntact PTH assay is "Now FDA Cleared" in its advertisements to its laboratory customers to gain market share:





18.  Nichols submitted to the FDA the package insert with the new lower reference range with reference to the Belgian subjects used.

The package insert that Nichols (owned by Quest Laboratory) submitted to the FDA:





19. The discrepancy between the 2 findings and publications of 13-55 pgm/ml and 6-40 pgm/ml normal reference range was finally resolved by an objective, unbiased, independant evaluation in which Nichols did not participate: 

20.  Spectra Laboratory (owned by Fresenius which has dialysis clinics that dose Abbott's Zemplar vitamin D to dialysis patients) is Nichols' largest customer.  Spectra asked Abbott for BioIntact PTH target values to use for dosing Zemplar vitamin D as can be seen from the Spectra letter:




21.  It appears that Spectra was faced with conflicting calculations for the accepted target range for the BioIntact PTH test for use in the dosing of Zemplar.

22. As can be seen from the following - the dosing guidelines from the Abbott Zemplar package insert instructs nephrologists to multiply the non-uremic upper limit of the normal reference range by 3 in order to calculate the target limit for the CRF patient.  Apart from this Abbott package insert Spectra there is no foreseeable reason why Spectra would study the normal (non-uremic) reference range of the Nichols BioIntact PTH assay.






   (taken from the Abbott Zemplar package insert)

23. Multiplying the Nichols revised new lower upper limit of the normal reference range of 40 pgm/ml (from the 6-40 pgm/ml) would mean a target value of 120 pgm/ml.

24. But, Nichols had already stated to nephrologists that the correct target limit for their BioIntact PTH test was 150 pgm/ml (as seen below) which would suggest an upper limit of the normal reference range of 50 pgm/ml (which is close to the 55 pgm/ml as originally reported in the 13-55 pgm/ml normal reference range found and published by Nichols, Harvard, NIH and UCSF).






25.  Now we can imagine that Spectra was faced with the following question:

Which of the 2 normal reference ranges was correct - the one with an upper limit closer to 50 associated with the 13-55 pgm/ml or the one that was  revised by Nichols as the lower normal reference range of 6-40 pgm/ml with the upper limit of 40 pgm/ml?  To answer this question we can imagine that Spectra was forced to carry out their own independant normal reference range study.

26.  Spectra carried out what they referred to as "extensive studies performed by Spectra" with the purpose to "more accurately define" the BioIntact PTH normal reference range.  The result was that in the following memo Spectra confirmed that the original findings of Nichols, Harvard, NIH and UCSF were correct - that is that the true normal reference range of 13-55 pgm/ml is correct and that the later revised lower normal reference range as later claimed by Nichols and Dr. Ketelsleger and submitted to the FDA and on which Nichols and Quest Lab market the BioIntact PTH test or the 6-40 pgm/ml was not able to be found by Spectra.

Dear Jeb,

 

How are you doing?  I hope that this e-mail finds you well.  I have being seeing you a lot in the local news down here as you are visiting schools and other stuff.  I like seeing you it is so reassuring.  N-E – way, I wanted to extend to you an invitation to our Spring Extravaganza.  The Spring Extravaganza is an annual end of the year affair that we have.  It will be held at the Joseph Caleb Center on May 23 @ 6:30 p.m.  If you are available you have to come by, I am sure that you will enjoy seeing the children perform. It’s a lot of fun.

 

Also on another note regarding Charter Schools, we have been watching the bills that have been coming out and I was really surprised to see that multiple sponsorship portion was taken out.  I was hoping that this school could eventually connect with a community college that would work with us to provide a more cohesive and seamless connection with the post secondary schools.  This would be beneficial for our students to ensure the readiness and appropriate preparation for college level work is provided.  If you can, can you look into seeing what can be done to ensure that concept is not lost, but rather stays at the forefront of our educational reform agenda.

 

I won’t go further, don’t want you to scroll – smile – Love ya, - Katrina

 

P.S. That situation is under control thanks to C. Licko – I will keep you posted.

Dear Governor Bush, 

I am most proud to report to you that the following elected officials and business leaders in South Florida have rallied to the cause, as we build a citizens leadership team to bring the FTAA Secretariat to South Florida. We will now continue to build this base, as we expand further north, and involve all the other leading citizens of our state in this quest. Thank you for your support and leadership. We would now be honored to add your name at the top of this list before we release it next week. Finally, since your schedule will not permit you to attend this impactive gathering, we will extend an invitation, via Senator Silver, to Lt. Governor Toni Jennings.

Sincerely, Randy

Randy Avon
Chair Elect
International Business 
Council of South Florida
*************************************************************************

As we in the South Florida Business community reach out to find new ways to help create a better regional economic picture for our 5 million+ citizens, we are taking a first step. On May 29th, many South Florida chambers, economic development organizations, community leaders, and public officials will take a progressive step forward to help unify our region to help bring the FTAA Secretariat to South Florida. The International Business Council of South Florida, with full cooperation of Enterprise Florida, will host an "Evening with International Leaders" and, we seek your support and involvement. The event will be a business international gathering, short on speeches, and strong on consensus building. We will honor an Outstanding International Business leader in Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties. We will also honor "An Outstanding Florida International Business Leader".
We are pleased that Enterprise Florida President/CEO Darrell Kelley, port and airport officials, International State, and national business leaders, tri county political leaders, and other respected community leaders have all confirmed their involvement.
We will update the VIP list each week to show the success of this unity effort.
The FTAA Secretariat will bring thousands of new jobs, hundreds of millions of dollars in trade and commerce to the region, and base the Trade Ministers of all 34 nations from our Hemisphere, here in South Florida.  

This event will be business attire with a gourmet meal, a solid opportunity to meet other regional business leaders, and a statement to the other 33 nations that south Florida speaks as one in our bid to host the Secretariat. We need you help and involvement. 

Thank you, Randy

To whom it may concern, I hope you can help me. I have been trying to get steady child support for my son since he was 2,He is now almost 15. I have done so much foot work and tracking him down and even when I get information  no one takes any action to get my support. Over the years he has been in and out of jail due to his own problems so then I'll get a small amount when he is in the clear its gone. He has been on disability,was granted a large settlement it slip through the system. He also manages to get his income tax first then IRS catches it but its to late he had gotten the check. I usually let things go but this recent action has got to me. I tracked him down again on line I happen to fine out he was in jail for carrying a fire arm. He was released over a year ago on house arrest and still is on this with suppervised probation. He will be on this until 8/4/2004. When I found this out I called The probation office to ask why non payment of child support didn't affect his probation. I also reported this infomation to Fla Child Support Enforcement. I started to recieve some child support after of course now it has stopped. I checked it out he is still on the probation still at same address,has a DL licsense. So I start to make calls again to see what might have happened. Now everyone tells me its up to him to pay his support that they can not enforce it. Could this be true?? I could go on and on and I won't. This story is to long. I can see why we have so many children out here with no support.But when I have done all the foot work and for all these years have placed him in there laps over and over again to be told they could do nothing when all these new laws have been past to help us but no one even tries to enforce them. What can we as parents do?? My name is Eleanor Rex My E-Mail is skip61617@aol.com My home # 407-327-8344 My Cell # 321-689-7470 My Ex's name is Daniel Scott Showalter dob: 8/05/1961 His probation is out of Orange  County Fla.

Honorable Gov. Bush,
 
Here's an excerpt from a new law in New Jersey.  Due to the fact that Florida's DOE does not enforce special education law or anti-discrimination laws for disabled students and their families, over half our disabled students do not have an appropriate education nor even the opportunity to receive an appropriate public education.  You have promoted vouchers as a way to "allow" families of these children to choose private schools to do a better job for them when, in fact, there are neither enough classroom placements in the private sector to serve these children nor are there more than just a few private teachers with the kind of training to provide appropriate education for these children.  Talk about empty promises!
 
Logistics aside, if public school staff faced such legislation as this in the workplace, our children would be receiving free appropriate public education as is their right under Federal and state laws in every state in the Union.  I can't think you want to increase our welfare figures and debt, so creating an educated workforce is your only option.
 
Please let me know who to contact on your staff to draft a bill of this nature for Floridians to consider as an option to improve our children's education and to truly begin leaving no child behind!

Intro to Legislative Findings:

2C:30-5.  Findings, declarations relative to deprivation of civil rights
by public officials

1. The Legislature finds and declares that:
a. Public confidence in the institutions of government is undermined
when an official engages in any form of misconduct involving the
official's office.
b. Such misconduct, and the corresponding damage to the public
confidence, impairs the ability of government to function properly,
fosters mistrust and engenders disrespect for government and public
servants.
.........
e. Existing laws must be amended to provide a greater deterrent to this
type of conduct, as well as to enhance other provisions of the law
targeting official misconduct.
f. Accordingly, it is in the public interest to strengthen our laws that
define and punish acts of official misconduct by members of law
enforcement and other public servants.

Subject: the current issue of gender bias in education


Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am currently pursuing an education degree from the University of South Florida.   I am enrolled in a education class called Social Foundations of Education where I have been exposed to multiple issues some of which deeply concerned me.  Of particular concern is the issue of gender bias in education.   As a college-aged woman, I am keenly aware of the effects of gender bias in education.
 
If you are not aware, gender bias in education occurs where there is an institutional bias against girls being able to perform well in certain disciplines - most notably math and science.  Though this bias may not be intentional, it is pervasive and action must be taken to remedy this problem.
 
At the higher education level colleges and universities have instituted special scholarship programs in an effort to attract women to pursue an education in math and sciences.  Obviously, such a program is impossible at the primary and secondary levels of education.  However, much can be done at the I-12 grades to encourage young girls to focus on areas from which they have been previously discouraged.
 
The DOE should provide funding for programs which are designed to improve females performance and participation in math and science.  This is easily accomplished through girl only math and science teams with perhaps the ultimate goal of statewide competition. Although this may sound bias towards boys you could alleviate that problem by having a separate all boys team.  Another example of the type of program that would help eliminate this disparity is a community mentoring program wherein women in the community, who have chosen career paths in math and science related areas, can provide mentoring to girls in their local school districts.  Support at the state level is necessary to the success of a mentoring program such as this. 
 
Thank you for your time and consideration.
 
Sincerely,
Laura M. Ethington

Jeb --

Adam Aircraft, which I am helping to raise additional capital here in NYC, is looking to build a manufacturing plant in Florida. For a variety of reasons, it needs to be in the general vicinity of West Palm Beach.  

Who should I call to begin this process?  

If this creates any kind of "conflict of interest" problem or "potential political problem," I will of course recuse myself.  But I literally don't know where to start and I figured you would.

Thanks for trying to get her. It was a tough loss and I know she will appreciate the call. 

Another topic: On Saturday you are interviewing the candidates for judgeship on the 2DCA. Doug Wallace from Manatee County is up for the third time. (If you discount the Canady selection, this would actually be his second time up for it.) Doug is a smart guy and is supported by the folks here. I have already sent a letter with my reasons for supporting him. One that I failed to mention, though, is diversity, geographic diversity. Most of the judges on the 2DCA are all from Polk and Hillsborough counties. There are a couple from Pinellas and Pasco, one from Charlotte and one from Sarasota. My numbers may be fuzzy but I know there are none from Manatee. 

All things being equal, I recommend you give the nod to Doug Wallace of Manatee County. Thanks.

Mr. Governor,

 Good to see you in Clearwater last weekend.  There's no more beautiful flag
on God's green Earth than the red, white, and blue.

 Points of Light.

 Some months back I entered the names, Virginia and Courtney Guildry who for
the past 30 years have dedicated their lives to the cause of LITERACY.  You
forwarded my nomination to the coordinator of that program and I started the
paperwork, but did not pick the ball up again following a major computer
crash.  Chris Coffin, the legislative and community affairs representative
in this region of Florida for VERIZON, left a phone message for me today
saying she'd picked up the process again.  I know the required reference
letters and other documentation  requirements have been met.  But, I do want
to add my two-cents.

 Ginny and Gil (or, Gunner, his life-career Navy carrier nickname) have
changed so many lives.  Within adult literacy circles here they are among
the best known associated with the movement -- involved in everything from
recruiting and training literacy volunteers, to handling the business
affairs of their local council, while always directly involved in one on one
teaching.  Well, big deal, there are millions of volunteers who are
dedicated to their cause.  Points of Light is looking for those candidates
in the one in a zillion class of extraordinarily passionate about their
cause, asking for NOTHING in return.  The Guildry team, all who know them,
will confirm -- they far exceed your most critical criteria for receiving
this special recognition.  Both a product of the Greatest Generation,  if it
is to happen, respectfully, it should happen now.  Please.  Thank you.

Dear Jeb,

Just had to send you a note thanking you for having Susan call me. We had a nice chat and I am VERY impressed with her. Great choice.

She did tell me that Rebecca did have alot to do with starting those bills through the legislature, so the press misjudged her I guess. I apologize for me and them. 

But I know now that Florida is going to take back the film industry. If there are any people that we can contact to see that the bills get through let me know as I want the best for my state. And , selfishly; I want my daughter, Chrissy to stay here and not leave for No. Carolina.  Dennis Jones said he would do anything he could to get a bill through for us, so I will contact him about these.

Chrissy is gaining alot of experience with WTSP in production, and already has 2 films under her belt now; a horror flick ( Corpses Are Forever--to be released soon I hope--after editing), and a short film. She is hoping that she can do more. These were filmed in Miami last Sept.

Even though we were not born in Florida( you-Texas, me-Georgia),we want the best for this state.

I feel in the next 3 1/2 years things are really going to happen for Florida with your leadership and listening ability to the public. You said in January that you wanted to really make a difference for this state and want us to help you achieve it. I feel this is an excellent start in this industry.

I am so proud to have a tiny piece in helping Florida.  If, in the future any environmental areas open up, you know I have served on SWIFTMUD under Bob and would be proud to serve again.

If you have a chance please send me a photo of Sugar. Did you get the one of T.J.?

Take care. God bless you and family.

Jeb,
 
I saw the article in today's newspaper,where you are considering a potential FCAT alternative for Spanish speaking children to ensure that NO child, regardless of language spoken/written/understood, is left behind.
 
While traditional paper and pencil testing companies CANNOT even find enough qualified individuals to score in Spanish...Vantage can deliver this capability for you TODAY with absolutely NO compromise whatsoever...
 
How?...Both Intellimetric,our essay scoring technology, and VLP(Vantage Learning Platform)our short answer/multiple choice online assessment capabilities are LANGUAGE INDEPENDENT. 
 
WE can score and respond in EITHER Spanish or English...
 
What does that mean to you?
 
It means that a student can write an essay/short answer/MC question in Spanish and get an English response OR write in English and get a Spanish response OR write in Spanish and get a Spanish response with the exact same acuracy rates essays/short answers/MC questions written in English with an English response.
 
We have delivered this program in Malaysia, in their native language, which is called BAHASA MALAY. BTW, Malaysian students are #2 in the world in the TIMMS test(an international version of NAEP) so we were really put to the test.
 
To review, Vantage can deliver to Florida TODAY:
 
1) The FCAT online(essay/short answer/MC) for both AT and general population students.
2) The FCAT online(essay/short answer/MC) for Spanish (ESL)speaking students.
3) A more secure environment (Vanguard) than the current paper and pencil FCAT version, score it in 3 seconds, with the same accuracy rate as TWO expert human scorers
4)Traditional paper and pencil solution for technology challenged schools/students
4)All of the above delivered at 50% less than what you are currently being charged, leaving the remaining 50% to be used as Florida sees fit...i.e. technology infrastructure
 
Jeb, the department has our proposal...we are ready to deliver what Florida needs and deserves, to lead the nation forward in NCLB.

Subject: FCAT and GPA


I am a Florida educator of 26 years.  I would like to see a "Technical High School Diploma" offered to high school students who:
1.  Maintain a 2.0 gpa or higher
2.  Have obtained all of the required credits for their high school
3.  Have attended a Technical Center, or have achieved Tech Prep credits in a sequence of 2-3 technical courses, or more
4.  Have maintained regular school attendance
5.  Have not passed FCAT after several attempts.
     I am currently collecting data at my high school.  I know of 3 individuals thus far, who's GPA's exceed 3.0 and they have been unable thus far to beat the test.  Have you taken the math portion or looked at preparatory books?  I hold a master's degree and find some of the language complicated and confusing.  The concepts are not necessarily taught and certainly are not mastered in our regular level math curriculums.  This is only the first year when HSCT is no longer an option.  Our ranking nationwide is at the bottom educationally.  A test will not solve this problem.  
     I am aware of the multitude of cultural, familial and demographic problems which affect our children before they walk through the doors of our schools.  We need more class time, more teaching time, better student-teacher ratios, and far less testing.  In our high school, the entire month of March, and parts of February are spent entirely on testing or test prep.  If we took the enormous amount of money spent on printing, preparing , distributing and administering the FCAT, we could buy a lot of teachers and classrooms, fill the rooms to 20 in all grades, and teach harder. 
     If you are thinking of cutting vocational funding for more academics, please consider our shortage of nurses, medical assistants, construction workers.  With FCAT as the only out, our drop out rate will increase from 41%.  We must offer careers and we must offer HOPE to the non-college bound of Florida.

Subject:	ERA -AGAINST - (depriving Women of beneficial Legislation)

Dear Governor Bush:

       Please oppose the Senate and House Bills.  In my opinion, there are 
many bad implications in these bills, one of which is depriving women of 
beneficial legislation.


       In the Congressional Record - Senate (March 22, 1972:  S4575) Senator 
Sam Ervin, one of the most respected constitutional lawyers in America, 
inserted a statement by Professor Paul Freund, Harvard Law School.  Senator 
Ervin asked " I also interpret your statement and what you have said to 
indicate a conviction on your part that there is a grave danger that the 
courts will interpret the House-passed equal rights amendment. .  . as 
depriving Congress of the powers it now has under the equal protection clause 
to adopt legislation which is for the benefit of women?"

       Mr. Freund. "Yes, I think that is quite right because there must be 
intended some more absolute standard of equality than the equal protection 
clause embodies.  That would be the point of the amendment."

       Please let me know your views on this bill.  Kaye Yonge, Orlando, Fla.

Hi:  Will be speaking on April 25, Florida League of Cities, Inc International Academy 2003 my topic “Terrorism: International Friends are Our Best Defense”  America’s secret weapon Citizen Diplomacy.  DC is making me a power point.  Maybe one day Citizen Diplomacy will not be a secret and all Americans can take part.  Watching the news last night it hit me that Citizen Diplomacy will be needed in Iraq to rebuild a Civil Society.  They will need police instruction, rule of law, how to vote in a democracy and how to choose and develop leaders, how to run a city in a democratic society and on and on.  This is not going to be any endeavor.  We have done well with the former Soviet Union, but it is still taking along time.  We cannot let a Mafia situation be developed like in Russia and horribly in Belarus.  I am taking on a student from Rollins, an Egyptian.  He wants to work for his government.  This will be like a reverse exchange and hopefully we will be able to help him understand the American way.  Of course we are contradictory many times, because we have every nation, every religion and every school of thought from every culture in the world.  We have the good habits and the bad habits of every nation of the world.  We are always hearing we like Americans but we do not like your foreign policy.  Actually we do not have a true foreign policy.  
Anyway just a reminder don’t let the Wekiva River basin be destroyed by GREED.  No one can live with out water period!  The State must take a strong lead on this issue.  This is not a local issue anymore but the survival of the State and the people who live here.   
Twice ICCF has done the Multi-Regional Programs for State on Water Resources.  We have listened to the best on these issues and something has to be done before we loose our whole aquifer system.  Also, we have heard about all the possible ways to augment are water system, but still our aquifer must stay whole if we want surface water in our lakes and rivers.  Thank you God Bless Patricia

To whom it may concern, I hope you can help me. I have been trying to
get steady child support for my son since he was 2,He is now almost
15.
I have done so much foot work and tracking him down and even when I
get
information  no one takes any action to get my support. Over the years
he has been in and out of jail due to his own problems so then I'll
get
a small amount when he is in the clear its gone. He has been on
disability,was granted a large settlement it slip through the system.
He
also manages to get his income tax first then IRS catches it but its
to
late he had gotten the check. I usually let things go but this recent
action has got to me. I tracked him down again on line I happen to
fine
out he was in jail for carrying a fire arm. He was released over a
year
ago on house arrest and still is on this with suppervised probation.
He
will be on this until 8/4/2004. When I found this out I called The
probation office to ask why non payment of child support didn't affect
his probation. I also reported this infomation to Fla Child Support
Enforcement. I started to recieve some child support after of course
now
it has stopped. I checked it out he is still on the probation still at
same address,has a DL licsense. So I start to make calls again to see
what might have happened. Now everyone tells me its up to him to pay
his
support that they can not enforce it. Could this be true?? I could go
on
and on and I won't. This story is to long. I can see why we have so
many
children out here with no support.But when I have done all the foot
work
and for all these years have placed him in there laps over and over
again to be told they could do nothing when all these new laws have
been
past to help us but no one even tries to enforce them. What can we as
parents do?? My name is Eleanor Rex My E-Mail is skip61617@aol.com My

Dear Governor Bush:

	 I understand that this weekend you will be interviewing candidates for the
vacancy on the Second District Court of Appeal in Bartow.  One of the
candidates you will be interviewing will be Doug Wallace, whom I have
recommended to you on previous occasions.

	I believe you have interviewed Doug on two previous occasions for a Second
District Court of Appeal position.  As I am sure you have discerned from
your previous discussions with Doug, he is one of the smartest people I have
ever had the privilege of knowing.  Doug is a true legal scholar and I
believe would be a tremendous asset to the Second District Court of Appeal.
I believe most of the Judges on the Second District Court Appeal would agree
with this assertion, since Doug has done a significant amount of work in
front of the court.  I would strongly urge you to favorably consider his
appointment to the Second DCA.

Thank you for your consideration.

Subject: EFA Modification Bill


Governor Bush ... it appears that you support the EFA Modification Bill (PCB NR 03-01a,  <http://www.myfloridahouse.com/Files/68815c94-f36f-4e7c-a68d-aa33444a7862.pdf> http://www.myfloridahouse.com/Files/68815c94-f36f-4e7c-a68d-aa33444a7862.pdf)... I see that you even have stated that Congressmen Shaw and Goss and others are wrong for opposing your view ... that changing the deadlines in the EFA will not undermine the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan ... I strongly recommend that you reconsider your position as I believe the Congressmen have it right.
 
The South Florida Water Management District has had since 1994 to develop and implement a plan to meet the December 31, 2006 deadline, and I have watched its progress closely for almost a decade now.  In my judgment, they have not properly planned ... they have never had the requisite sense of urgency.  My summary of the facts supporting my opinion are attached ... I prepared them prior to the Judge Hoeveler hearing of last year.  It's ironic that when I testified in court that there was no way for the SFWMD to meet Phase 2 by 2013, which I considered the earliest feasible date given all the tasks that had to be accomplished, the SFWMD representatives adamantly refuted my argument ... now only a few months later it is no earlier than 2026 ... and then it is only to the "maximum extent practicable." (My schedule at that time is attached also ... by the way I still don't believe the District has developed something similar)
 
Do you remember the letter that you sent to Carol Browner in February of 1999 (copy attached) pleading for a return of NPDES permitting authority for the stormwater treatment areas to the State of Florida?  In return for that authority you committed to using your good offices to accelerate Phase 2, i.e. "Furthermore, the Phase II technologies are showing great promise for dramatic improvement of water quality at minimal cost. With the State of Florida assuming authority for issuing the NPDES permits, I will also encourage the South Florida Water Management District (SFMWD) to accelerate incorporation of Phase II technologies into Phase I as quickly as possible."  You simply did not come through on your commitment.  An expert team representing all interests spent several months putting together an excellent plan that would have enabled you to fulfill your commitment ... it was a CONSENSUS plan of ALL OF THE KEY INTERESTS ... an incredible accomplishment.  But, for whatever reason, you did not ensure it was implemented.  I must admit that I was shocked that you did not take advantage of this amazing feat ... unfortunately, its implementation would have prevented the situation you find yourself in today ... c'est la vie.  In the final analysis, a commitment not honored and another opportunity squandered.
 
I also remind you that CERP, page H-F-17, says, "For purposes of evaluating the future (2050) and alternative plans, the so-called "Phase 2" treatment technologies necessary to meet water quality criteria adopted pursuant to the EFA were assumed to be implemented.  The EFA requires that, by December 31, 2006, the ECP treat EAA stormwater runoff delivered to the EPA to either the adopted criterion or the default numeric water quality criteria of 10 parts per billion (ppb) total water column phosphorous concentration (TP)."  Your Federal partners have always assumed that the state would meet its commitment to cleanup the water currently entering the Everglades via the Everglades Construction Project.  Is this to be another commitment not honored?
 
In addition, it also seems that you think the proposed bill will prevent lawsuits.  Don't know where you are getting your advice, but from my point-of-view nothing could be further from the truth.  Believe me, the Clean Water Act doesn't work the way you are trying to make it work ... you are opening the door to numerous legal attacks, wasted money, and delays in restoration.  Don't forget that the court has already ruled that the EFA was a change to State water quality standards, but with the help of EPA, said Dec 31, 2006 was OK for a reasonable compliance deadline and expects that deadline to be met ... not sure anything later will stand the test.  And there are many more vulnerabilities to consider.
 
It is actions like the current bill, which removes all deadlines and concrete requirements for ensuring water discharges into the Everglades that are protective of the resource; the State's fight, all the way to the Supreme Court, not to have to clean up water entering the Everglades from Broward county; and ignoring the explicit commitments written and agreed to in CERP regarding water quality, that seem to most to contradict the State's stated commitments to work in partnership with the Federal government to restore the Everglades.  And yes, at some point, probably not in the distant future, the Federal government will lose faith ... at least the U.S. Congress.
 
Once again, I ask that you seriously consider my advice ... the future of Everglades restoration hangs in the balance.  If you care, the State must honor all of its commitments if we are to be successful in restoring the Everglades ... a legacy I believe worth fighting for. 
 
Sincerely,
 
Terry

Governor Bush,
       Sixth District Congressional Candidate, Dave  Bruderly, and I ran into your DEP appointee Alan Bedwell at the State Capitol on April 9.  Bedwell said that my work publicizing the plight of the Ichetucknee from industrial pollution had not been in vain.  He said you advocate a Senate and House bill which will stifle unscrupulous industrialists from receiving permits in environmentally sensitive areas, and he asked me to help publicize the bills.
       Your representative assures me that your reneiging on your promise to protect the Ichetucknee humiliated you; he said that your position was legally indefensible, thus you promote these bills to provide legislation to keep the bad boys out of business in Florida.
       I am wondering if you have any funds to provide me for this small task.  I have not worked in politics since my defeat in preventing the cement kiln from polluting our rural landscape, because I wonder what difference I can make.  Bedwell and others assure me that I raised awareness concerning our springs, but policy does not seem to change in your administration.
       For instance, the same environmentalists who opposed the cement kiln oppose Walmart and Dollar General from invading our rural small town of Alachua to provide low-skill, high-pollution jobs (traffic, light, sprawl, disel fuel fumes).  The drain on education funds does not promote a citizenry who can do much more than load and drive trucks.
       I object strongly to your provision of state funds for roads which will serve Walmart in Alachua. We object to the denial of our Comprehensive Plan's provision to limit urban boundaries.  At the very least corporations such as Walmart should build their own roads, not drain limited tax funds from pressing needs of the people.
       Thoughtful citizens are trying to run Walmart out of their communities in Ocala, Gainesville, and Alachua.  We prefer non-corporate, small business development, and more emphasis on preserving our quality of life in North Florida.
       That said, I would be willing to publicize your anti-bad boy industrialist bills, provided some funds would come available for my work.

dear governor
 
as you know every time a judicial vacancy occurs in orange/Osceola or Seminole county I get a call for a recommendation.   I have sent you a couple in the last couple of months.  there is a new vacancy  in orange county which includes the name of Marc Lubet.  I know nearly every one of the persons who came out of committee including three sitting county court judges however the candidate with the most experience and most likely to be a good circuit court judge is marc lubet.  I know him from working with him throughout the years and we have actually co counseled matters together.  I know the quality of his work and the demeanor of the man.  I highly recommend Marc.
on the other note, it was a pleasure to see you on Puerto rico day in Tallahassee.  I agree that we should not lower our expectations of esol students.  the schools are always looking for a excuse for not teaching or testing.  I did alot of work on the esol question when I was a state rep and investigated how these schools are conducting their bilingual programs.  they are a disaster, money used for esol students (which is at the higher  f t e rate) is not a categorical expense and thus not spent on esol students.  Children who do not even need esol classes are classified as needing such training to justify the higher f t e rate.  before we give the schools a free pass on English deficient children we should carefully study this issue.  You once appointed me to a commission which investigated the manner in which school boards spent their money  "equity in educational opportunities"  this state needs to do that type of in depth study of the disparate and poorly performing bilingual programs around the state.

battered by them and told to keep our mouth's shut.  

Even our state's FDLE and FBI covers up for this ongoing racketeering in
county and state offices and tip them off to our complaints.  Florida is
NOT the Sunshine State..... it's the nation's corrupt "Police State".

I know this isn't your beat, but I thought Tom could direct me to some
internal affairs within the FBI or someone we could trust as our lives
have been threatened for exposing these criminals wearing badges or
judicial robes in the 6th Judicial Circuit.... or those holding high
county commissioner's offices in Pinellas county.

Forget about corruption in IRAQ, it's nothing compared to this
place....... "ONLY MURDER".  You may forward these pleas for help on to
Tom as we don't have his e-mail address.... or put this on the Cox News,
Reuters or AP wire.

Thanks for your concern and help as we are frantic and being
terrorized.....

Dear Governor Bush:
I wanted to tell you that after much discussion I have decided not to seek reappoint-
ment to the Board of Indian River Community College.  It was a decision that Don
and I discussed at great length and not one that was taken lightly.
As you know, Don is a builder and developer in Vero Beach and has done a lot
of school work.  As long as I am on the Board of IRCC he will not be able to 
bid on any work, as we have a code of ethics for our Board and could be seen as
a conflict of interest.  
I have felt so privileged to be a part of IRCC and want to thank you for appointing
me.  It has been one of the most exciting things I have been able to be a part of.
I have learned a lot and seen how well run the College is.  We are very fortunate
to have a College like IRCC in our state.  I will continue to support the IRCC in any
way I can.
Once again I thank you for your support.
I do have a wonderful lady, Edie Bradshaw, that I would like you to consider to take
my place.
Sincerely,
Linda Proctor
p.s.  IRCC had an Entrepreneur of The Year award dinner last evening at the Mueller Center in Vero Beach and the man of the year was Alto "Bud" Adams from the Adams Ranch in Ft. Pierce.  He is such a humble man and I thought you might
like to know able the award. 
p.s.s.  We are very proud to have you as our Governor and your brother as 
our President.  
On the lighter side, I did order your Aunt Teensie and myself another Bull Bag.  She
loved it!

Dear Mr. Jeb Bush,
     How are you doing today?  I hope that you are
having a good day and not working to hard.  I have
another question for you.  
     I was wondering if there were any intern or
summer programs at the capital.  As you know from past
e-mails, I am very interested in our government and
the process of our government.  If there is any
information that you could send me I would be very
thankful.  Have a great weekend... thanks for taking
the time to read my e-mail.

P.S. God Bless... Thank you again for your time...

Governor Jeb Bush
State of Florida


Dear Jeb:

Over the past sixty days our hotels in Orlando have experienced a number of
cancellations of school groups, some coming from within the state and some
from other states.  Today we received two more cancellations, one of them a
middle school (Nims Middle School from Tallahassee).  When I inquired as to
why Nims cancelled their trip to Orlando/Disney World, I was told that the
school board had recently issued an advisory stating that students could not
travel for more than one day, due to concerns arising from the war in Iraq. 

Jeb, I can't imagine what the war in Iraq (a war which has been a brilliant
campaign to date) has to do with students who wish to come to Orlando for
their spring break vacation.  Also I wonder what kind of message this is
sending to other schools outside of the state.  Anything you can do to help
with this situation would be very much appreciated.

Dear Govenor Bush,

He has a 4.0 GPA is an excellent student, and is even a 2002 State Recognized for Verbal Ability in the  Duke University Talent Identification Program for his score on the high school SAT's.  He was in 7th grade at the time.  He is currently in the wait pool for the IB program. They had a lottery and kids got in not as qualified as Scott.  Can you read his letter and advise us as to what we can do?  He is crushed and words can't describe his disappointment.  He has wanted to go to this program since 5th grade.  I really appreciate anything you can do for us.

Jay is poor, has no lawyer and didn;t know any better so he believed the Prosecuting attorney.  (foolish)   I have talked to Jay and he has now filed his on appeal.  I will try to be there for him.  It is all very sad and a lot of money the state has spent on an absurb situation.   Its very hard to control everything.  I know you hate wasting money and you are trying very hard.

Subject: Letter of Support-EFI's FY 03/04 Budget
Importance: High



Good morning, Governor... 

I know that you receive a significant number of emails and letters each day, but I'd like to draw your attention to the attached letter -- one of nearly 100 such letters that have been sent to the Senate leadership requesting that the Senate readdress the issue of funding for Enterprise Florida (EFI) in its FY 03/04 budget. This particular letter, however, is unique in that it comes from one of the hundreds of consultants that we work with in our efforts to diversify Florida's economy. 

While the letter is certainly worth reading in its entirety, I'd like to point out a paragraph that I believe deserves particular attention:

"...Florida's budget situation, while extremely challenging, is somewhat less severe than in many states, and thus also presents strategic opportunities.  In some ways, this may be the best time to preserve funding for economic development programs, enhancing Florida's competitive opportunities as other states become weakened by the measures some will choose to address their budget problems, including large tax increases and cuts in economic development funding.  Interestingly, some states, such as North Carolina, have decided to take this opportunity to increase economic development investments, with the recent adoption of a powerful new jobs creation funding program (similar in some ways to the QTI program ).  On the other hand, other states are considering de-funding existing programs, one even reducing funding for companies that already relocated in reliance on an agreement with the State.  With some forty states confronting record high deficits, there is a definite strategic choice to be made, and it would appear that Florida is in an enviable position to maintain and enhance its competitive position."

When I received a copy of this letter, I was reminded of an article I read in the April issue of Fast Company in which the editors addressed current economic conditions and what it will take to get our nation back on track. They said: 

"In every period of American history, recessions have provided the springboard for the next great round of economic growth. More than half of the companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average were started during a recession. Which is why the time to innovate is now. The companies that use this time to outthink, outperform, and out-innovate the competition will be the ones poised for even more rapid growth in the future."  

The same, of course, can be said of states and for those organizations like EFI that help states grow high-value jobs. Now is the time to be aggressive in telling our story, a story that clearly indicates that Florida is indeed poised to be the state of the 21st Century. Your efforts and the efforts of the leadership in the House are vital if we are to have the funds necessary to do that job.

Regards, 

Darrell

Subject:	Everglades Phosphorus Reductions - CORRECTED COPY

In response to Terry Rice’s email today, the State of Florida can be proud of its record of Everglades phosphorus reductions that have occurred over the last decade. 

Since the passage of the 1994 Everglades Forever Act, incredible phosphorus reductions have occurred, with over 1,300 tons of phosphorus removed through implementation of landowner BMPs and the Stormwater Treatment Areas. These reductions have exceeded the expectations of both the 1994 restoration plan and the federal Consent Decree.  Two additional STAs are under construction and will begin operations later this year and into late 2004, further reducing the phosphorus entering the Everglades. 


Looking towards the future, we now have the opportunity to continue the momentum of Everglades restoration by implementing the March 2003 Conceptual Plan for achieving water quality goals in the Everglades.  This comprehensive plan contains: 


*	aggressive timelines for additional cost-effective phosphorus reduction measures, achieving 93 percent of the goal of 10 ppb prior to December 31, 2006,
*	specific phosphorus reduction performance expectations,
*	ambitious design targets,
*	continued research of ways to further reduce phosphorus entering the Everglades, and
*	activities designed to accelerate recovery of areas in the Everglades that are presently impacted.

One lesson learned from the 1994 Everglades Forever Act was that by codifying the restoration plan with specific deadlines into law, the number of lawsuits that ultimately delay restoration have plummeted dramatically.  In fact to the best of my knowledge there have been only one or two lawsuits filed that have specifically challenged the implementation of the Everglades Construction Project and the courts dismissed both of these.  This is a testament to what can happen when disruptive lawsuits are avoided by codifying the restoration plan directly into legislation.

I will leave the candidates legal qualification comparisons to those more qualified than I to judge this.
 
I will however point out that Mr. Schlesinger is known to be of excellent character and fair in judgement.
 
He is, and will be guided in all matters by his love of God, Country and family.
 
I see him every morning as he takes his daughters to school. I see his self sacrifice and involvement in the community at large.
 
I see the thought process of his decisions based on fact and analysis of the facts both with short and long term considerations. I see his thought process guided by practical financial analysis and not a wish factor, thus allowing him to bring real world working applications to the solutions.
 
He is an Anglo American with broad support in the Latin, Anglo, Jewish, and Black communities.
 
In fact, as I look at his life and the decisions that brought him to this point, I see in him a greart similarity to you.
 
Thank you for kind indulgence.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am writing again to strongly recommend the appointment of Alan Deserio to the 2d DCA. I have known Alan professionally for over 20 years. During a portion of that time we were adversaries when he was representing the State of Florida and for another portion we practiced together as partners. Throughout the entire period my respect for Alan grew as I watched him handle difficult legal problems with wisdom, professionalism and integrity. Alan is a student of the law, a good listener and is able to decisively reach the correct conclusion based on the facts and the law. Alan respects the law and believes in judicial restraint. His views concerning judicial responsibility are consistent with those you have expressed personally and those expressed by speakers who have addressed your leadership forums. Over the course of twenty years Alan has consistently placed others above himself in his work and in his personal life. He has been gifted with a peaceful, patient, gentle and self controlled demeanor which guides him through conflict. He has exhibited wisdom over the years in dealing with his friends and adversaries. All of these character traits coupled with his knowledge and experience in the law would serve him well as a judge. He capable of earning the respect of all he comes in contact with, even those who disagree with him. I could not give anyone a higher recommendation than I give to Alan.
 
During the time I’ve known Alan I’ve frequently thought that he possesses traits that would enable him to be an excellent appellate judge. I hope you will decide that it is in the best interest of the State of Florida to give him this opportunity.
 
Sincerely,
Cary Gaylord

Dear Gov. Bush,
 
Oh my goodness, I heard that we missed seeing you on April 8th when you visited the 3rd floor Capitol rotunda!  We had just broken down our displays and left before you arrived.  Thanks so much for stopping by to see us!  Everyone was so excited that you put us on your agenda!  Sorry we missed you.
 
The day started with a press conference at the old capitol building front lawn where amongst thousands of pinwheels planted in the lawn (to represent thousands of young lives saved through our child health program) coalitions across the state presented Sen. Ken Pruitt and Rep. Sandra Murman with awards for their support.  We then proceeded to the 3rd floor Capitol rotunda to man exhibits and to send out the message "Millions served, thousands saved".  
 
Also, the Healthy Start initiative of Osceola will receive a "Super Stars of Prevention" award at the halftime of the Orlando Magic game on Sat. 4/12 (for child abuse prevention month).  Coalition members & staff will be on hand to watch the game and accept the award.  Go Team!!
 
Our new three-year service delivery plan is in - we in Osceola will focus in on Low Birth Weight & Prematurity (with special attention to prepregnancy healthcare, smoking cessation & nutrition), Access to Care, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome - SIDS, Teen Pregnancy Prevention, and Child Safety.  More to come on that...
 
I will be visiting Tallahassee again on May 1st to meet with the Department of Health.  I am president-elect of the Florida Association of Healthy Start Coalitions (FAHSC).  Perhaps if you are free Cathy Cortez, current FAHSC president, and I could come to see you and meet with you briefly.  It would mean so much to us!
 
Thanks again,
Patty

Dear Governor Bush:  You helped me so many times.  Please help me now.  My friend, 
Scott Lombardo is the smartest kid I know.  He wants to go to Suncoast High School and 
he lost the lottery.  It is not fair that there is a lottery for a magnet school.  PLEASE HELP 
HIM.  HE IS SO UPSET.   He knows how you sent me a gold coin and how you have 
always answered my questions when I email you.  Please help him.  Please,  do it for me. 
He is my friend and he has always had straight A's.  And he has always dreamed of 
going to Suncoast.  He is in the national honor society and also his principal told him he 
was surely going to get in.  Then someone started the lottery.  Some kids with B's got in 
before him.  That is not fair.
You know that I always tell everyone how good you are.  Please help me this one last

Governor Bush, 

I was a true pleasure meeting up with you at the Governor's Family Literacy Celebration of Reading event in Naples.  The involvement of businesses in the educational system bodes well for the children of Florida.

As the Chairman of the Broward County Take Stock in Children Leadership Council, I am also pleased to let you know that this year we will have 42 students graduating from our local high schools. As they head off to college, most of them as the first family member to ever do so, they take with them the hopes and dreams of every young person to be successful in life.  Your continued support of the Take Stock program during your governorship has been truly remarkable.

We are now in the process of setting up a Graduation Gala for this, our first graduating class. We have a tentative date of June 4, and we are absolutely thrilled at the prospect of sending these fine young adults on their way to the great adventure of college.

It goes without saying that we would love to have the First Education Governor as our honored guest. When the invitations are finalized, rest assured that while we will be formally honoring the dedication of our 42 graduates, your presence would be true testament to their success.

Part of our program will focusing on the accomplishments of these graduates. To that end we are trying to get in touch with as many community leaders as possible. I recall during the 2002 campaign, Don Peebles was a supporter of your candidacy. With him being such a prominent figure in Broward County, we are hoping to add him to our Leadership Council.  If at all possible, could someone from your staff provide us with a good contact within his office? An introduction coming from the Governor's office is always helpful. Thank you for any help you could provide!

I look forward to continuing our friendship, and hopefully seeing you in June!

Jeb,

We know you are very attuned to the growing problem of workers compensation
coverage in Florida.  Several of our members are having a great deal of
difficulty getting coverage after their carrier either left the state or has
quit writing their industry.

Unless the Florida legislature will be satisfied to see manufacturing leave
Florida, and reduce the economic base to lower paying jobs in the tourism
and service sectors, then it must act.

We are hopeful you will do everything possible to cause action on this issue
during this legislative session.  It is critical.

Thanks for listening

Dear Mr.Jeb Bush, I really didn't expected you to responed to my e-mail I 
sent about my child support problem I had sent you a copy of a letter that I 
had sent to ACES Child Support Org. My name is Eleanor Rex e-mail 
skip61617@aol, I'm from Winter Springs Fla. I just wanted someone to help me 
for I have been fighting for my sons child support for 12 years.I have done 
everything but bring my ex  myself to child support enforcement many times 
but this time when they are telling me that even thought he is on supervised 
probation(and he had been on this probation for going on his second year 
until I stumbled upon it) that there is nothing they can do he can pay if he 
wants to. They also told me this at the Orange County probation office.It is 
just unbelievable to me.I struggled work 2 and 3 jobs even made another 
mistake in getting married which I had another child whom I raised with no 
help just looking for that help to keep my family together.Which the child 
support system fails to do.Sometimes that child support is the difference of 
a child eating,having a roof.While these non paying parents laugh in your 
face on the way out of these child support hearings never paying just going 
on making more children.My story could go on and on and I'm sure there are 
1,000 of parents out here like me. Our child support system does need 
help.But Thanks to you a Karen from Dept of Rev. left me a message to call 
her to talk about my case.Hopefully she'll be in Monday.I do want to thank 
you for your time I know you work hard for us. I do pray that this problem 
can one day be fixed because these innocent children don't deserve to be 
treat like they don't matter, even if a parent just walks out on them and 
never looks for them. They should have to be responsible in some way. It 
suppose to be the law that you have to pay but some how it falls throught the 
cracks and no one follows up. These children deserve a future too! If you 
know of any other help my # 407-327-8344 Thanks Again Sincerely Eleanor Rex

The students don't read the books on the computer, they just access the web pages that my students set up.  The middle school campus is adjacent to our high school campus.  Initially I had 20 seniors mentoring 60 seventh graders.  Now I have 60 seniors working with 120 ninth graders.  I know what you mean about having a hard time reading off of a computer.  I have to carry the book I'm currently reading around with me and I don't think I could ever be comfortable reading off of a computer screen.

First my students choose a book and read it or reread it.  I bought multiple copies of novels with money from a mini grant I wrote last fall.  If they don't choose one of the books I purchased, I encourage them to choose a book they really love.  Some of the titles they are currently reading are:
Number the Stars
The Old Man and the Sea
Tortilla Flats
Winter
The Return of the King
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
Old Yeller
Huckleberr Finn
Then they set up a web page with a series of informational and instructional pages about the book.  Next they prepare a document, video, powerpoint, or flyer promoting their book and visit the middle school or 9th grade classroom.  The younger students take a few days to look over the materials left behind and then select a book.  Once they have selected the book, they visit my web page, where they receive all the information they need to read their books including activities and a timeline.  On each group's page, there is also a link to email both my students and the "characters" in the book, with questions and comments while they are reading. All students have to send a copy of every email to me.  
At the middle school level, initially, my students also visit the classroom several times a week to talk with the students about the book.  With the 9th graders , at the end of the allotted time, each group (there are 8 right now) meets for a book talk.  These meeting dates are published in the local paper and community members are invited to attend.  We always have parents and members of the Arts and Humanities council attending these book talks and of course there's always lots of food.  The students love it!  At first the younger ones were intimidated by the upperclassmen, especially the extremely cool members of the varsity football and wrestling teams, but our reading groups keep growing and both the seniors and the underclassmen wanted to keep the program going.
I know it's sounds confusing but it's really working out well.  
Thanks for getting back to me so promptly.  My children were rather skeptical when I told them who I was writing to last night!

"FAMILY FIRST CRISIS"

"SPECIAL FLORIDA GRAND JURY"

Dear Governor Bush,
Thank you for your personal replies to my messages and prayers for you
and your family.

I and several others have taken your lead to fight widespread criminal
corruption throughout our state and we were so pleased that you
requested the establishment of a Special Statewide Grand Jury last
December to clean up serious crimes throughout the state with emphasis
on Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties and "others".

As a grave oversight, your staff failed to include Pinellas County,
Florida's most corrupt county, by far.  We citizens of Pinellas County
have put our lives on the line to expose this corruption including all
of the items in your request plus threats of murder, personal battery,
grand theft under color of law, law enforcement corruption and
cover-ups, sexual favors, drug dealing, bribery, perjury, obstruction,
conspiracy and on and on.

As a result, I've been called "Nigger Lover", "White Nigger Boy", rumors
were spread by county officials that I was a dead man, my animals were
slaughtered and thrown bleeding on my porch to die, my classic cars and
boats firebombed, large trees knocked over, physically battered by
Sheriff's officers, violations of oaths of office, case fixing, fraud
and on and on.

I've suffered over $650,000 damages and others have lost over $500,000
and their small children put in grave physical (sexual abuse)
danger......a bank examiner was also threatened by criminal friends of
this same particularly corrupt judge..... who happens to be my drunk
neighbor, 6th Circuit Court Judge Charles W. Cope...... former "Chief
Family Judge!", until his arrests.

During a recent phone conversation, your own learned executive counsel,
Rachel Rodriguez told me that this same corrupt judge shouldn't even be
on the bench as he pled out and paid $5,000 on serious criminal sexual
charges against a young women in Carmel, California when he was arrested
for sex crimes, theft and several other charges while stumbling drunk
after midnight at a national judge's conference at the taxpayer's
expense.

Judge Cope was also arrested at another Judicial Conference for being
drunk in Naples, Florida.  Recently, he verbally assaulted and
threatened county workers at his home and threatened to sue their boss,
the County Assessor, indicating that he will sue them all as he has
political connections.

Now, this same habitually drunk judge and three of his "judicial
roommates" (as he shares a suite of judicial offices), are now ordering
me out of town if I don't deed and thus annex my valuable land over to
the county for their park.  I've refused to buckle under to their
threats.  They hate any minorities in "their" town and we hired a black
man and a hispanic man to help poor elderly people. 

Now that I've spoken out to the press and on Public TV, I was again
assaulted and injured by two Sheriff's deputies and my right arm was
injured.  The doctors at the VA saw my injuries and were all furious
that I am faced with this constant abuse.  

I was threatened that if I filed a report or complained to the state's
authorities, they would see to it that the judge Baker Acted me with a
stroke of his pen and they would keep me in there....... as they laughed
at me.

I still went on public TV and now they are going to destroy my property
and land.  "Please" put a stop to this and have your Special Florida
Grand Jury investigator or foreman examine 6th Circuit Case No.
00-004194-CI-7.  Any honest state forensic legal investigator from any
grand jury will see the crimes in the record...... and will seek
criminal indictments.

The County Attorney's office called me "white trash" and they laugh at
me when I am in distress over these ongoing judicial and county official
crimes.  Numerous terrified families and children are fighting this
corruption without any help from Tallahassee.  Even FDLE and certain
local FBI individuals are covering up these criminal acts as former
Chief Judge Susan Schaeffer is deeply involved.

A former Pinellas County Judge wants to help expose these crimes and
corruption under oath and everyone is fearful of being murdered.  The
bank examiner was threatened at gunpoint to keep his mouth shut and has
had a run-in with Judge Cope's rampant corruption.

The Sheriff's log and the St. Petersburg Times show over 14 domestic
calls to judge Cope's residence.  He walks around drunk and wanders the
neighborhood in the early morning hours stumbling drunk.  He has
conspired with the county attorney and filed false police reports
against neighbors while he's drunk.

He is out of control and now he wants my property destroyed early this
week based on an illegal order he signed against me in his fit of
drunken anger.  He shouldn't have even been on this case being my
neighbor...... I've never had a trial and I'm not allowed to have
witnesses..... as he signed an injunction hoping I'd just give up my
land after over 40 years.  

He offered to fix the case if I deeded over my houses and land and left
town.  I've been sued 32 times just to run up huge fees and levy my
land, private lake and spring and park with false court costs.

We urgently need your action on Monday morning, April 14, 2003 to put a
stop this crime wave in Pinellas County and stop drunk and corrupt Judge
Cope and the others from this grand theft or murdering me for telling
you the truth.  

This is not a drill.  His bailiff's know he's a drunk and he even left
his "drunk clinic" and went out and rented a motel room and got
black-out drunk again for two days in Pinellas County and lied to the
JQC and said he was not drinking...... he had lied again while under
oath, because Judge Schaeffer finally admitted he did have a "little
slip up"...... and he's still on the bench.  

Please look into his sexual perversion orders from the bench.  Tampa
papers wrote that this made no sense and was "weird'...... putting a
little 6 year old sex victim back in the same home with the admitted
molester with no jail and just house arrest with the "same" little girl
which violated all Florida's criminal statues and guidelines.

He has the goods on sex crimes on other 6th Circuit judges and law
enforcement as well as major drug dealing in Pinellas County.  Bernie
McCabe and Sheriff Rice know this and cover up for these criminals.  Two
local FBI agents leaked these reports to McCabe and Rice instead of
opening up an investigation.

Please protect children, our property rights and our right to due
process by issuing an Executive Protection Order to maintain the status
quo pending your Florida Grand Jury's immediate opening of an
investigation. 

Several of the victims of this corruption attended the Family First
function at the Marriott Hotel in Tampa and listened to the wonderful
music and the prayers and you fine speech to our group and we now
believe you will do what is right and proper.  

You can do this with just a phone call.

Please have Rachel Rodriguez prepare this Executive Order as this is
literally a matter of life and death for citizens who believe in you and

Subject: stem cells and cloning


Dear Governor Bush,

I originally sent this e-mail to Brian Yablonski who asked me last 
year to keep him and your office updated on any crucial information 
related to the cloning and stem cell issue.  Since I just found out 
that Brian is no longer in your office, I hoped that you would not 
mind me sending it directly to you.

We met in February of 2002 when you invited me to discuss issues 
related to  cloning and stem cells. As you probably know, my group 
does not work with either human embryonic stem cells or cloning 
technologies, and we instead concentrate our efforts on our own 
populations of adult stem cells. I am not sure if my feelings about 
working with human ES cells will ever change, but I do know that I 
will never clone another human being (in fact, according to an 
article published in Science today, it may not even be possible). 
Nonetheless, late last year I was invited to a meeting in Vienna that 
turned out to be arranged by a European Union commission to help 
establish policy for the use of human embryonic stem cells in the EU. 
Again, even though we do not work with these cells, the expertise of 
the Program in Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine here at 
the University of Florida is pretty extensive, and therefore it is 
not unreasonable for us to offer information. Just as during my visit 
to Tallahassee, my goal in attending the Vienna meeting was to only 
provide basic information on regenerative medicine issues without 
stating any position.  Since there are many ethical, moral, 
religious, humanitarian,  scientific and legal considerations related 
to stem cell research and therapeutics, I feel that it is best for 
people like me to only address the science (and some aspects of this 
are not even that straightforward!).  To make a long story short, the 
EU now has a document that summarizes their position on many of the 
issues surrounding stem cell research and therapies.  I was provided 
with access to this document, since we did help with some of its 
formulation, but it is also now available on their web page.

I am attaching the document here, and hope that it provides 
additional information on how others are dealing with this.  It was 
nice meeting you last year, and I wish you and all of the Florida 
legislators God's Speed in dealing with these and other difficult but 
important issues.

Sincerely,

Dennis Steindler

Dear Governor Bush:

I'm sending a copy of a e-mail I received from someone on my education e-mail 
loop.  I don't agree with the position.  Remember my first e-mail to you 
explaining how many lunch bag puppets my son made in Kindergarten?  We pulled 
him out of public school and placed him in a private Jewish school, although 
we are Christian, so he would get the level of education we expected.  He 
completed all Kindergarten and First grade work at this school and is reading 
at approximately third grade level.  Although I believe FCAT has it's 
problems, I don't believe it is the problem.  I do have a problem with 
schools using children to send their political messages and this is just 
another example of that, in my opinion.  Please keep the standards!

Editorial

The Everglades 'albatross'

   © St. Petersburg Times
   http://www.sptimes.com

   published April 12, 2003

http://www.sptimes.com/2003/04/12/Opinion/The_Everglades__albat.shtml

As a House committee voted Wednesday to postpone Everglades cleanup for two
more decades, Florida's top environmental cop was remarkably
docile. "Whatever date is put into law will not speed up or slow down our
process," said Department of Environmental Protection Secretary David
Struhs. "That is because the laws of man cannot affect the laws of nature."

Is that so?

The Everglades is losing roughly six acres a day to cattail invasion because
the laws of man allowed sugar and dairy farmers and urban
developers and flood-control engineers to use it as their sewer. After
environmental groups waged fruitless battles over the years to change those
permissive laws, a U.S. attorney sued in 1988 and found a federal court that
would listen. The result was that some new laws of man, the 1994
Everglades Forever Act, were passed. Those laws were primarily responsible
for the impressive reduction to date in the amount of phosphorous,
once pegged at 300 parts per billion, that pours off farmlands and into the
Everglades.

The cleanup delay that Struhs and Gov. Jeb Bush are so willing to accept is
the handiwork of House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Joe
Spratt, who is from LaBelle, in the heart of sugar cane country. Spratt,
too, advances a novel argument. He says that delaying the deadline is
actually a way to hasten cleanup, because adherence to the 2006 deadline
would just spur lawsuits. Spratt might want to run that rationale past
U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler, who still oversees the court
settlement that forced lawmakers to adopt the 1994 law. Hoeveler's next
scheduled hearing is in June.

Those who have watched development and agricultural interests manipulate the
Legislature may not be surprised by this latest stunt. But some
U.S. House members are understandably outraged. "This is bad legislation and
an albatross around the neck of your congressional delegation,
who have to advocate for federal dollars on your behalf," wrote U.S. Rep.
Clay Shaw, R-Fort Lauderdale. "You cannot amend this bill now, shift
the responsibility for paying for the cleanup once again to the taxpayers
and then expect the federal government to keep writing checks to restore
the same Everglades Florida won't stop polluting."

Congress, you see, is pouring $8.4-billion into cleaning up the River of
Grass. Call it the money of man, and understand why Shaw expects the
laws to match.

Jeb:

Mary Laura se comunicó conmigo para hacer un plan en  relación a los
niños que han fallado el examen estatal. Yo creo que un progrma bien
diseñado para el verano de Santillanan Intensive English va a ayudar a
solucionar este problema para evitar retener en tercer grado a los niños
que no dominan el inglés.

Con relación a los estudiantes de secundaria que no se van a poder
graduar, se pueden encontrar soluciones sin bajar los "standards" .  Por
ejemplo, se le puede enseñar a los estudiantes en su propio idoma las
destrezas (skills) para saber interpretar la lectura y darles
situaciones en inglés para que transfieran estas destrezas. Al final del
curso, se le puede dar un examen en los dos idiomas qara ver si están
preparados para tomar el examen estatal.

En la parte del examen de matemáticas, podemos dar un curso intensivo en
donde se le enseñen a los estudiantes los términos claves que necesitan
saber en inglés para comprender los problemas. (Hay muchos términos en
español que son los mismos que en inglés, pero es necesario enseñarlos
para que los puedan identificar).  Al mismo tiempo, se le puede dar un
examen paralelo en español para determinar si es el inglés la causa del
fallo en el examen o si es la falta de conocimientos académicos.

Yo tengo gran credibilidad en esta área sobretodo en la parte central de
la Florida, ya que soy la evaluadora de los programas de ESOL en Orange
County, Seminole,  y Osceola. Además,  he sido  evaluadora de programas
federales en Hillsborough, Pasco, Broward y Palm Beach. También soy la
consejera del Consortium de ESOL de la parte central de la Florida.

Yo puedo tener una reunión con todos ellos para presentarles un plan que
tenga tu aprobación y que presente soluciones a los problemas. Estro
puede prevenir que la legislatura presente un plan que tú consideres
vaya en contra a los prinicipios del plan A+.

Yo estoy dispuesta a trabajar en esto todo el tiempo que sea necesario.
Juntos podemos lograr que se haga algo equitativo y a la vez, que sea de
calidad.

Subject: A testimonial to your just read program


  

Dear Governor Bush,

 

My name is Sue Sholtes, and I am a Reading Intervention teacher at Trenton High School. Actually, until two years, ago I taught 7th Grade Science, loving every minute of it.  Our school was fortunate to be selected as part of the ‘Lucky 13’ schools to be pioneers of the ‘Florida Reading Initiative’, and since then, I have turned my focus to teaching struggling readers.

          My situation is rather unique.  Most of the students I am now working with were also in my 7th grade class. This has given me the opportunity to watch them grow………or NOT grow!  I’d like to tell you a story about one such student.

          Bobby entered 7th grade as a non-reader. He excelled at math and could remember anything that he heard, but had to have all of his tests read to him.  I’m sure you can imagine why, by the end of the year, his frustration level exceeded his motivation, and he had to repeat the 7th grade.  By the end of  middle school, Bobby had given up any hope of receiving a regular diploma.

          Bobby was placed in my reading intervention class at the beginning of this year. He is now a junior. His reading FCAT scores reflected his inability to read.  By this time he was at school for only one reason…auto mechanics. The possibility of ever passing the FCAT reading section was, in his mind, completely out of reach.  I was also becoming frustrated with him in class, because his inability to read was prompting behavior problems.

          Finally, at my wits end, I made a deal with Bobby. Each time he would master a skill on Academy of Reading, a phonics based computer program, he could have the rest of the period to play games on the computer. Reluctantly, he agreed.  After a few weeks of this Bobby began to feel a small amount of success with the program, and by Christmas, he was willingly mastering two skills a day.  Without realizing it, Bobby was learning to read.  I retested him in December and his reading level had gone from a 1st grade level to a 6th grade level!  

          Bobby and I have an ongoing feud about who he calls “my governor”.  He claims that “my governor” has made it impossible for him to get a diploma……..I say, “my governor” is the reason he has learned to read! The most astounding thing happened about three weeks ago. Bobby met me at my classroom door at 7:30 one morning waving a newspaper at me.  “Do you know what “your governor” has done now?”  He proceeded to show me an article about the possible doom of Florida shellfish farming, due to cutbacks in the FDA. Bobby’s family makes their living farming clams. Needless to say he was furious!  I simply asked him if he had read the whole article himself.  “Of course I did! I read it three times!”  All I could do is smile at him.

          I thought you might like to know that your reading programs around the state are changing the lives of so many kids like Bobby.  They may think you are road blocking their future…I think you are giving them one. 

 

With sincere thanks,

 Susan Sholtes

Trenton High School

 I have copied a letter from Bobby to the end of this letter......

 

Dear Governor Bush,

 

          I am a junior at Trenton High School.  I have some personal concerns about cutbacks that you have suggested concerning the F.D.A.  These cutbacks could result in the increase of unemployment of hardworking people in the shellfish industry.  These people include my family and me.

          My teacher, Mrs. Sholtes, is always arguing with me that you are a good governor, and in some ways she has convinced me that she is right.  She says that I have learned to read because of FCAT.  I say I may never get a high school diploma because of FCAT.  If I can’t get a diploma, my family will need its clam business more than ever!  Please don’t take both of these away from me. They are my future!

 Sincerely,

Bobby Hurst

Trenton High School

You seemed so nice so I didn't see any reason why it wouldn't be true.   I started saying ,"I don't  have any make-up on" . " How does this shirt look"?  Along with other stuff  all the way to the elevator  and out on the first floor until  they burst out laughing .  I gave them a Ha-Ha you guy's are so funny.   They laughed for day's and made sure to tell everyone.  It was kind of funny! I even laugh when I think about it.

I hope all is well with your family and God is being good to you all.  

God Bless The Bush Family.

Sincerely,

The Florida Rally Mom - LeeAnn  (Yellow For the Troops!)

P.S. I think we need to start thinking about a welcome home party for the troops!

What I said was that the state should not intervene to keep the park open as an entertainment park. Certainly, we should consider operating the property as a state park.

Subject: Please help to SAVE CYPRESS GARDENS!!!!!!!!!!!


Dear Governor Bush,
I live in Orlando and served on the Florida Arts Council for four years.  I am a mother, grandmother, wife, volunteer, friend, and passionate patriotic American!  
As you know, Cypress Gardens is being closed today!  When I heard the news on Thursday, I joined thousands of others with a crushed broken heart!!!
Cypress Gardens is a state treasure.  It was the cradle of our Florida tourism industry.  It is a goodwill message to visitors from all over the world!  Other states spend millions of dollars to draw people to their area and create a good image.  Cypress Gardens is wholesome, one of the most beautiful spots on the earth, a source of goodwill to visitors from all over the world, and a treasure especially to the citizens of Florida.
I was raised in Georgia, but my grandmother took me to Cypress Garden each summer in the fifties...  In those days, a photo from the park ran in an average of 100 publications a day.  "Day of Discovery" was broadcast from there for years.  We also drove down every year on Easter for the sunrise service.  
Their domed gazebo is one of the most photographed spots in the world.  I have treasured pictures of my two daughters growing up there. It has been a favorite field trip destination for youngsters all over Florida for years... what a loss for future children and the teachers!  It is a family place... a place for flowers.  Not to mention the ski show... 
I produced the Miss Orlando Pageant for two years.  Mr. Pope, Sr., loaned me 20 of the antebellum gowns, accessories and all, for my production in the 70's... and he had his people deliver them, help our contestants dress, etc.  He even had the grace to make me believe that I was doing him a favor!   Going to Cypress Gardens is Miss America's favorite appearance and it is the only time she is allowed to wear a swimsuit during her year's reign. 
 I fear the incomparable 223 acres will now be sold to some developer and a 67 year-old treasure will be gone.  I join others in being devastated!!!  Their several hundred employees found out yesterday.  Today they were in tears.
 My family went to Cypress Gardens yesterday.  I wish you could have been there!  
The park was packed!!!!!!   People were there in stunned disbelief to say goodbye.  The cars were backed up to Highway #27!   There were all ages represented... seniors, families with children, young couples walking holding hands,  everyone.  I have never seen so many cameras.  Many of the people were crying.  Everyone had their own personal story.

I filmed the crowds today... and the little girls in antebellum gowns.....  and the tearful skiers....  I asked guests how they would feel about their tax dollars going to support CG.  Without exception, they passionately said they would support it.
Everyone was sad...... but no one knew what to do.  When you think of it, many things that have been done  were accomplished by simple human beings with the motivation that they care and they did what God told them to one step at a time.  So even though we are simply regular everyday citizens with very short notice, I earnestly ask that you save this family treasure for future generations.  It is not glitz.  Rather it is wholesome, inspiring, peaceful, gorgeous.........
I know that you were on the news on Friday night and said you are not for the state stepping in... But Governor Bush, please try to  understand what CG means to the people here... 
Today is the last day.  Atlanta was a terminal for rail roads before the Civil War.  It was even called "Terminus" before it was named Atlanta.  Before people realized what was happening, the magnificent historical railroad terminal was imploded...   The people of Atlanta were stunned and sadded.  The leaders have regretted it since!  If Cypress Gardens is distroyed, it to will be gone forever...  
Florida citizens need your help!  
 Could you please consider the state buying it to make it a state park so this landmark can be saved?  This is Florida history!!!!!!!  This is family!!!!!!!   And once it is gone, it is gone!!!  States spend millions for dollars to draw people to their area and create history and a good image.  We already have history and a beautiful, gracious, and fabulous image that makes a positive impression for the hundreds of thousands of visitors from all over the world!!!!!
Please Governor Bush, help us save Cypress Gardens...  My heart longs to have something wholesome and beautiful for my grandchildren and their children to visit.
Thank you for your consideration.
With kindest regards and great concern,
Burma Davis Posey

Dear Governor Bush,

First I just want to thank you and your family for all the sacrifices you
have made  for our Country and our families. For putting your life on the
line being in the forfront as you are. Your efforts are not going unnoticed.
You are a hero!  May God Bless you and His favor be on you and your family.

I am the Publisher of Cornerstone Connection you received some of my
magazines near the end of last year. One of them had President Bush on the
cover and you may remember, several years ago you were on the cover with
Sara Trolenger and The House of Hope.
Cornerstone Connection is one of the largest Christian magazines in Central
Fl. of our kind as we are not only in all the bible book stores and almost
300 churches, but also in most of the family restaurants, schools, car
dealer ships, hospitals, Codos and Apartments all over Central Fl. My
passion is to reach millions to the Lord in my life time, to be a positive
influence and make a mark while I am here. We have gone through as many as
400 every two days in a lot of the restaurants especially sence Sept 11.
People are searching and scared looking for answers.
I am happy to say we are doing our part. Most Christian media are only found
in bible book stores and churches. Probably 70 percent of our distribution
is out among the cecular.

I had spoke to someone in your office last year as we had been in business
10 years in 
June 2002. They said you would send a letter of congrats and an autographed
photo. I am disappointed to say we have yet to receive anything. I know you
are very busy, but it would be much appreciated if you go to the appropriate
chanals to make this happen. It would be an honor to publish your letter  in
our Letters to the Editor Column. We have already received letters from
Mayor Hood of Orlando, Mayor Russ Haucks of Altamonte Srings and Sheriff
Keven Berry of Orlando and many other leaders in the community who
appreciate our positive influence.

I would also love to do a piece on your efforts to save Cypress Gardens and
make it a State Park as I have lived in Orlando all my life. Most of us
remember it to be one of the first tourist attractions in the state. It
would be a sad to see one of our landmarks distroyed. Please help save this
beautiful park.

I appologize for the length I have thought about writting you so many times
and just to busy to take the time. I guess I have one more reason to be
thankful for Cypress Gardens. Due to the urgent need for a positive answer
in this situation, I decided now is the time.

Thank you again for all you do to make a positve difference.

Sincerely,

LuAnne Anderson

Understand your predicament.  The example shared with me addressed issues for bright Hispanic students coming to the states in grades 10-12 with a language barrier. Here's a thought about accommodations:
     Provide English immersion (eliminate electives in regular school day or pre/post school session, pending student and school)
     Take FCAT like everyone else, but with extended time like ESE
     Maintain a minimum 2.5 GPA
     Set an acceptable passing score for the TFOL or other identified language measurement showing the student can speak entry level English, but not at the level to pass the FCAT. DOE could review what is acceptable passing score.  Effort is made to help the student, but standards are not totally thrown out the window.  

Students who are not academically inclined will obviously not maintain a high GPA, pass the FCAT, or pass TFOL.  Whatever happened to English immersion until they speak the language? What is the total number of children who cannot speak English adequately to pass the FCAT? It is our job to be sure children can speak English to function in America and be successful in college and career, not exempt (but accommodate) students.   See you Monday in Miami.

April 13, 2003

Dear Jeb:

I am sending you this e-mail in support of the judicial candidacy for the 11th Judicial Circuit of a good friend and colleague of mine, Jorge J. Perez.  I've known Jorge for almost 8 years now ever since he joined the INS legal office back in 1995.  In fact, Jorge's office is just down the hall from mine. 

I consider Jorge to be one of the most trustworthy, ethical and honest individuals in this office.  He is also an excellent lawyer who has handled and won some of the most important cases in this office.  He came from a very large firm and has excellent academic credentials.  Yet he left that firm to pursue public service.

In all the years I have known him he has shown a fair and kind temperament, which I believe will make him an excellent judge.  He is intelligent, even handed and objective.  He has worked to make this office a better place to work. He is a leader in our office and he is respected very highly. 

Over the years, I have had many positive discussions with Jorge about many issues ranging from politics to fairness.  Jeb, I can assure you that Jorge J. Perez shares your vision of what a good judge must be.  

His decency, intelligence, sense of fairness, respect for the rule of law and the proper role of the courts will make him an excellent judge.  He is a good and decent man and an excellent lawyer.  I would be proud to have my friend Jorge as a Florida State Court Judge.

Con mucho afecto y cariño, como siempre, quedo,

Milton

Subject: Re; Healthcare crisis


Dear Governor,
Lawyers and their greed for money caused the current crisis with Trauma Center in Orlando area, and other medical fields here and the whole country.  Unjust lawsuits resulting in exuberantly expensive malpractice costs to doctors and caregivers is the cause.   
Chairman Crotty's solution to give more taxpayers money to doctors and hospitals to keep the Trauma centers open, is nothing else than additional taxes on citizens.  Hospitals and doctors will in turn spend this "extra" money on malpractice insurance.  This serves only one purpose: keeps lawyers happy and it enables them to continue with frivolous malpractice suits and blackmailing medical professionals and taxpayers out of their money.

It is no wonder, that doctors don't want to stay in business in which, for giving their best, working odd hours, performing almost miracles (many times for free since most of urgent neurosurgical cases happen to nonpaying crowd) they are sued by the lawyers when the outcome of their operating is less than what only God could do.

Current malpractice system allowing lawyers to fault doctors (hospitals, nurses...) for the mishaps of their clients, is the root of the problem.  Making more money available for that system is a Band-Aid covering the rotten core of the problem.   Getting counties (taxpayers) pay more money to protect and continue this lawyers' system, is insane.
Until the real problem, malpractice laws and lawyers greed for money, is tackled, the crisis will continue.
Please attack this problem vigorously in your legislative sessions, so no further damage to our Healthcare system is done.
Barbara Voit,
Orlando

Governor,

I really appreciate receiving the  announcement of the Press Conference tomorrow in Homestead.  I received a call from Julia Johnson alerting me but she did not have the exact time.  Regretfully, I will not be able to attend because of a scheduled "must attend" meeting in Downtown Miami at 11:00 AM.  It will be impossible for me to make it to Homestead before the end of your press conference.

I am really interested in what is going on with FCAT.  It appears that everyone is focusing on "one test" without acknowledging that education is a cumulative process.  Acquiring the knowledge to pass this test should begin in pre-k.  We also need the structure that  reviews, periodically, if students are being taught the skills/knowledge we value and have identified as necessary for success and personal independence.  We should be very serious about what is being taught at every level and hold those in charge accountable. In stead of complaining about students being held back in third grade, we should be asking the principals and teachers why.  If the appropriate value added requirements are not enforced at every level, we will always have this graduation problem. This structure, in no way, should eliminate the opportunity to offer other learning experiences.  In education there is such a thing as "an intregrated curriculum" that would allow for all of these things to be together.  It would, of course, require serious changes.

As for the FCAT, it is interesting that I have only heard  "...these students cannot pass this test, but we assure you that they have been taught the skills identified in the Sunshine State Standards..."

Thanks for the leadership you are providing and the determination to make a difference in education, which will result in an improved quality of life for all of Florida's citizens.

Subject:	Amending the Everglades Forever Act



Dear Colonel:

I saw a copy of your recent e-mail to Governor Bush on amending the 
Everglades Forever Act.  I appreciate your concern, but am guessing some of 
your early information may have come from inaccurate new reports.

In fact, the bill you cite in your e-mail does NOT change any deadlines in the 
EFA.  December 2006 remains untouched.

Your help in correcting this misperception would be helpful.

Also, your comment regarding the prevention of lawsuits is actually one that we 
AGREE with.  

We have NOT suggested that amending the EFA is a way to avoid litigation.  
Quite the contrary.  We recognize that litigation is unfortunately inevitable.  The 
challenge I have as a public manager is to put the state in the very best position 
for prevailing in that legislation and making sure delays to our restoration 
progress are minimized.

Some of the amendments proposed to the EFA will actually help us in that 
regard.  The amendments, if passed, would allow us to go into court with a 
legally enforceable plan, schedule, and investment strategy to ensure progress 
continues.   We will not rest until 10 ppb is ultimately achieved, not just for 95% 
of the Everglades, but 100%.  This has been part of my testimony now several 
times.

Finally, you correctly point out that CERP has an expectation that phase two 
treatment technologies for water quality will be up and running by 2050.  We 
share the objective of having that done much sooner.

Thanks for your ongoing interest and support.

Subject:	Re:RE: judicial appointment- 11th Judicial Circuit

Dear Jeb,

Thanks for your prompt reply. I am doing well thanks to God. We live in America, we are healthy, we have jobs, we have a loving family, we have very good friends and we continue to labor as advocates for individuals with disabilities. Berthy just came the other day from a very interesting (to say the least) redesign meeting in Tally. I am sure you got messages from other sources about said meeting. Berthy is working overtime in responding to the issues, questions and controversies that have come up during and after that last redesign meeting. I believe she will be in touch with you about it. 

Early in March (around the 14th)I met with Jimenez. I believe our meeting went well. The next thing that was going to happen was that I was going to be called by him or by his first assistant to give me a definitive response and make arrangements to sign some papers so that the FBI background investitation gets under way. I have not received any call since then, but I verified that all the references have been called. I will be calling him tomorrow to follow up. Thanks for your help. I do appreciate it very much.  

Sometime late last year I invited you to come with your wife and have dinner with Berthy and I here in our home whenever you are in the Miami area. I want to invite you and Columba again. I know that you are very busy and have many important matters to attend, but if you can so arrange, Berthy and I will love to have both of you at our home for a couple of hours one of those days that you have more time available (maybe during a slow weekend).  

Thanks Jeb. I hope you are having a good weekend. May God continue to bless you and your entire family to whom we owe so much.

Con mucho afecto y cariño, como siempre, quedo,

Milton

Subject: judicial appointment- 11th Judicial Circuit


April 13, 2003

Dear Jeb:

I am sending you this e-mail in support of the judicial candidacy for
the 11th Judicial Circuit of a good friend and colleague of mine, Jorge
J. Perez.  I've known Jorge for almost 8 years now ever since he joined
the INS legal office back in 1995.  In fact, Jorge's office is just down
the hall from mine. 

I consider Jorge to be one of the most trustworthy, ethical and honest
individuals in this office.  He is also an excellent lawyer who has
handled and won some of the most important cases in this office.  He
came from a very large firm and has excellent academic credentials.  Yet
he left that firm to pursue public service.

In all the years I have known him he has shown a fair and kind
temperament, which I believe will make him an excellent judge.  He is
intelligent, even handed and objective.  He has worked to make this
office a better place to work. He is a leader in our office and he is
respected very highly. 

Over the years, I have had many positive discussions with Jorge about
many issues ranging from politics to fairness.  Jeb, I can assure you
that Jorge J. Perez shares your vision of what a good judge must be.  

His decency, intelligence, sense of fairness, respect for the rule of
law and the proper role of the courts will make him an excellent judge.
He is a good and decent man and an excellent lawyer.  I would be proud
to have my friend Jorge as a Florida State Court Judge.

Con mucho afecto y cariño, como siempre, quedo,

Milton

Governor, 

Let me be the first one to say that I will support Miguel Diaz de la Portilla in his mayoral bid for Miami-Dade County. But I do not think it is right for him to remain a  member of the School Land Advisory Board while he is running for that position. True, there may not be anything legally wrong with it, and Lord knows it would not offend our other political friends, but there is a perception that his membership on this board will allow him to leverage contributions from school board interests to a degree that he would not have been able too if he had not been a member. I would certainly support his re-admission to this board after the mayoral elections. But I think it is only prudent to ask him to step aside until these mayoral elections are concluded.

You are in receipt of a letter from John Baker, CEO of Florida Rock, requesting a 
land swap.  He followed up with an e-mail to you; you responded you would 
discuss with me.  I am prepared to do that.

Florida rock owns 211 acres that is not mineable.  Board of Trustees owns 239 
acres that is mineable.  Obviously a very large estimated difference in value 
between the two parcels.

Mining in that part of the state is, of course, controversial.  Florida Rock would 
also seek 100 year easements from the state to move materials in and out.  
Also, this would beg the question again of whether or not we negotiate land 
exchange deals with private interests who approach the state, or whether we 
bid/auction these opportunities more widely.

Recognition
Ms. Theresa Alcanter
State Board of Education
April 15, 2003

 At a time when so many fear that failure to get a standard Florida high
school diploma will be their ticket to a doomed future, I am pleased for
this Board to recognize a young woman who proves that theory wrong.

 Ms. Theresa Alcanter was recently recognized as one of Florida's All
American Success Stories. Out of 125 nominees in various categories
nominated by school districts and community colleges, she was a statewide
winner in community and technical education.

 Ms. Alcanter was born in Michoacan, Mexico, in 1968.  Her parents
immigrated to the United States with their 12 children when Theresa was 14
years old. She had already dropped out of school in the eighth grade for
financial reasons.

 Unable to speak English, she worked as a farm laborer earning just enough
to pay rent on a small room and buy food. By age 17, she found work in the
fast food business, finally earning the minimum wage.  She then began taking
English classes. She passed the GED exam and earned her high school diploma.
Then, she worked as a hotel housekeeper and got married.

 By the time she was 21, she was a divorced single parent struggling to
survive.  She was forced to work 70-80 hours a week at several jobs to
support her baby.  Then she learned about the Central Florida Joint
Apprenticeship Training Council through Mid-Florida Tech.  By 1996, she
started making $6.20 per hour, more than she had ever made in her life.

 After a five year apprenticeship, Theresa and her 12-year old daughter
bought a home and no longer have to worry about their next meal.  Ms.
Alcanter is currently a foreman for Buena Vista Construction Company at Walt
Disney World.

 She is accompanied today by Mr. Jim Sullivan, the head of her
apprenticeship program.

Subject:	NOTICE TO JEB BUSH... Pinellas County Sheriffs are NOT PublicServants


Dear Jeb,
Last evening I went to my home and property in Ozona, Florida with
friends who later became eye witnesses and saw where I was again the
victim of breaking and entering and grand theft and vandalism.

We sought out a Pinellas County Sheriff's Sergeant (Sergeant Romano)
sitting in an unmarked vehicle parked along a side street near my
property and I approached him and ask him several times to take a crime
report.  He finally radioed it in.

At first he refused my request numerous times as it appeared he was
visiting a friend while on the job and repeated for me to call it in
myself and "then" he radioed in my request.  We waited at the crime
scene and when another deputy drove up, he said he "didn't know" if he
was going to take a crime report or not....??

I extended my hand to introduce myself and he said he would not shake my
hand as this was his policy.  As I showed him the broken locks, severe
damage to my buildings and looting of classic boat and classic car
equipment and valuable marine equipment (antique outboard motor, sails
etc.) he appeared rather impolite and well, snotty.  

I said to him that this was "breaking and entering" with the two broken
door locks, etc. and the deputy smirked and said that "there is no such
crime".  I said I've heard Sheriff's use the term "B&E" before..... he
again smirked and said that I was watching too much television! (in a
sarcastic tone.)

We were told to always document (on video or pictures) any incident with
the Pinellas County Sheriff as they are dangerous and are corrupt to
citizen's numerous times and they falsify police reports.

When a gentlemen took a picture of the crime scene which included the
deputy, the deputy became angered and claimed he didn't want his picture
taken as he was still deciding if he was going to take a full crime
report on my property and was just taking out his notebook to get my
name.

The man then asked permission to take pictures of him on my property and
the deputy ordered him "no".  We indicated that he shouldn't hesitate to
take a crime report as a public servant.  This deputy bristled and his
face became stoic and he stated quite firmly, "I am not a public
servant".  

His outrageous statement surprised us all.  A lady at the scene was
shocked and kindly requested.... "As a Pinellas County Sheriff, you are
not a public servant?'  This officer again restated that he was "not a
public servant".  She asked, what are you then?  He responded that he
was a Sheriff's officer and that his being a "public servant" was not in
their "job description".  His tone became curt and unfriendly towards
her question and this frightened and intimidated her somewhat and she
kept quiet.

This is not a joke as he said this in front of 3 witnesses.  The
estimated crime damages were in excess of $30,000.  The Sergeant then
returned to the scene in his vehicle to visit the deputy and then they
met and went to view the broken locks, damaged buildings and grand theft
scenes and I started to walk with them and requested if I could go on my
property from the sidewalk with them and they ordered me "no".  So I
remained off my own property so as to not anger the officers.

After they returned, We didn't see where they had been or what they did
in my buildings while they were out of our sight.  What scared me was
the FBI recently arrested 8 Sheriff's deputies for planting drugs on the
property of citizens they wanted to set-up for false charges of felony
drug trafficking crimes.

I then showed them the boards that were pulled away from another garage
to gain access into the building and at that time I was alone with the
two deputies having crossed a street.  Without any witnesses, and alone
with them, both deputies then became quite hostile with their
questioning and their tone became forceful and very sarcastic.  

When I ask why they were being so threatening and loud, the Sergeant
walked up to me within an inch or so from my chest facing me and looked
down at me with a glare and snarl and raised his voice like a Marine
Drill Instructor and snarled "we're out'a here".

I yelled back across the street 2 times for my witnesses and they came
running.  The Sergeant's demeanor then immediately changed and he calmed
down and when I told my witnesses that the Sergeant had walked up to me
in a chest to chest threatening pose, the deputies lied and claimed that
it was I who walked up to the Sergeant in a threatening manner and then
they both said that I was very threatening and disruptive!! .... all
complete lies.

I walked back across the street and I was both scared and angry at their
lies and another friend said he knew what the Sheriffs were doing to
provoke me and to just left it go and not get angry when they lie or are
abusive.

I asked both deputies why they did this and then lied that it was me who
was threatening.  They didn't answer my other questions and completed
the Sheriff's business card with the criminal case number and we all
left the scene.

The Sergeant was Deputy Romaro according to his name plate as he refused
to give me his business and name card when we first met.  The other
Deputy was J. Walker and I have his card.  I am fearful of what lies
they are going to write on their Crime Report Case No. 03-86674.  

We need a complete investigating in Pinellas County immediately.  A
young female was recently choked and held by her throat (caught on a
camera shot taken by a press photographer) yet, "she" was arrested for
criminal felony assault and battery on a police officer and faces prison
now.  The other officers all lied for each other.

A female was battered in a courtroom...... and a Lt. Queen just laughed
in her face (as he's done to me and others) when she attempted to notify
the Sheriff of these serious felony brutality crimes.

One teenager youth was recently murdered when he was assaulted and
battered on his face and his head held underwater by a Sheriff's deputy
with a long record of abuse on Pinellas County citizens and also had
severely beaten a man on the neck and back with his flashlight.  

The coroner ruled it a clear homicide by the deputies.  Yet, Bernie
McCabe failed to prosecute this serious homicide and this abusive maniac
deputy is out in public again with his gun.

One deputy shot a youth three times in the neck when he had his hands up
with a cell phone and the deputy said he thought the cell phone in the
raised hand was a gun and "was in great fear for his life".

This evening, this deputy could have shot my friend dead when he had his
little camera out taking crime scene photos and the deputy also failed
to call for any crime scene forensics staff or take any crime scene
pictures himself.

Both of these Sheriff's officers were cocky and unprofessional this
evening with a major chip on their shoulders and maintained their
glaring stances to all that were there as if they were doing us a great
personal favor.

Please, Jeb, without your personal care and immediate intervention, more
innocent people are going to be killed by this out of control Pinellas
County and the rampant government corruption.

Many Pinellas County families and victims want to meet with you asap and
the Special Florida Grand Jury investigators about this criminal crisis
as this is nothing more than a lawless police state here in Pinellas
County and the county commission officials are lying to your face as
they don't respect you or your high office..... please stand up for
us.... we beg you!!

Subject:	Tax Credit Concept: Round 2
Attachments:	Econ Div Tax Crdit - Full Legis[1].doc



Governor - 

After your last email, I've given some thought as to how we might better package and implement an Economic Diversification Tax Credit program-- if not this year, hopefully the next.  I'd sincerely appreciate your further feedback on this - both in terms of the merit of the concept and whether it's "doable" given the current political climate.

As you will recall, I proposed the tax credit concept as a way to further induce private-sector contributions to EFI.  I know you'd agree that given our current budget challenges, private-sector support has become more important than ever.  

I believe there were two overarching concerns about the program in its current form; 1) that it could tempt lawmakers to immediately decrease state funding for Enterprise Florida, and 2) that it might be a tough sell given current economic conditions.  We've developed a couple of options that might help alleviate those concerns.

The first option is to "share" the proceeds with the state after a certain threshold has been met.  Our initial suggestion is that after raising the first $2 million in private-sector funds, EFI would "share" with the state 50 cents on every additional dollar raised.  After $2 million, the state could feasibly begin to decrease its base appropriation to EFI using this calculation.  As an example, if we were to raise a total of $5 million in a single year, the state could decrease its base appropriation to EFI by $1.5 million.

Another, perhaps more intriguing, option is to "share" the proceeds with the effort to secure the FTAA Permanent Secretariat.  It is my understanding this effort will require significant funding, and this option would create a single mechanism by which to raise funds for both EFI and the FTAA efforts.  Using the tax credit program, we would provide Florida FTAA, say, 25 percent of the private-sector funds raised after the initial $2 million (not to exceed $1 million annually).

My thinking on the second option is that developing a statewide funding mechanism by which to support Florida FTAA will not only provide greater stature for the effort, but will "tee up" statewide private-sector support for an important initiative in a tough budget year.

Please know that I have not mentioned this concept to Ambassador Cobb ... I need your advice on both options and whether you think either idea will fly this year (or next).  I've attached draft legislation for your review.

Again, thank you for your candid feedback.

Governor,

 

I am concerned hat your Department of Management Services has started the process of adopting a new rule, which would impose a 1% fee on all contracts with the state.  As a not-for-profit and as a Faith-Based Organization I see this as an added tax on charities that are already loosing money due to a lack of adequate funding. 

 

As a recipient of services and/or goods imagine what those you do business with would say if you told them you were going to charge them 1% of their bill for your services in checking the accuracy of the statement, writing them a check and mailing it back. Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? That is what you are asking of us. 

 

Cutting funds for children and families served in family safety and behavioral health to provide more money for the Department of Management Services is not appropriate. In fact it is mean spirited.  

 

Please know we oppose any such fee.

The selection committee, with very serious deliberation, has elected to
nominate Bud Nocera as the permanent CEO for VISIT FLORIDA.	On this
second go-around we had three extremely qualified candidates.  However, in
the last four months that Bud has been the Acting CEO we have seen a
performance, both inside and outside of VF, that has truly amazed us.  The
committee felt that there is nothing better than actual performance to
evaluate a person's potential.  We also felt that the least amount of
learning curve would be needed in these difficult times with Bud's
selection.

Prior to formalizing anything the committee wanted me to discuss with you
our selection and insure your support.  Without it, we would not proceed.
Your are an integral part of our effort and, indeed, the Chair of the
Commission and we seek your wise counsel.

I will be visiting with you tomorrow, and perhaps we could find five minutes
to discuss the topic.

Thanks,  


Peter Guptill
Chairman, VISIT FLORIDA

Governor, I spoke again to Mr. Johnson today after being briefed by in-house
counsel on the status of NACS--the entity about which Mr. Johnson
complained.  It seems that DBPR's Notice to Cease and Desist from Unlicensed
Activity, which was issued on February 4, 2003, had the desired effect in
that NACS has now provided an application and check for licensure to the
Constrution Industry Licensing Board. Diane

Jeb,
In my capacity (since April 2002), as President of Tropic-Kool
Engineering 
(TKE), I've become aware of an issue that I think you'll find
interesting and 
if you agree, I'd like you to introduce me to Diane Carr, your secretary
of 
the division of regulation and compliance.
Here is the story, TKE was founded in 1978 to provide mechanical
engineering 
and contracting for the Burger King chain of restaurants on a national
basis. 
 It has survived and at times thrived in that capacity to this day.  A
few 
years ago a few TKE employees left and started their own firm, National 
Corporate Account Services, Inc. (NCA).  They have recently been
competing 
with us on a national basis for business with Dunkin Donuts.  While they

claim they are merely a supplier of HVAC related products, their actions
and 
inclusion into the plans for Dunkin Donut projects indicates they may
indeed 
be acting as a contractor in this state as well as others.  TKE's
general 
manager is licensed in over 20 states and the costs associated with that
in 
time and money are significant.  We have consulted our corporate
attorney and 
he believes we have enough evidence to take them to Federal court for
unfair 
trade practices.  The state of Florida's Department of Business and 
Professional Regulation has issued a notice and order to cease and
desist on 
one project in Orlando (DBPR case # 2002-015128).
My question and concern is that they continue the practice and recently
won 
another Dunkin Donut job in Florida and we believe they are still not 
licensed in this state or any other (not your problem, I know).  While I

realize there is little that can be done on your end and they are
innocent 
until proven guilty, our business suffers while operators such as these
who 
avoid the associated expenses of playing by the rules can win contracts.

My hope is Diane Carr or her staff might have some ideas that could help
us 
level the playing field.
Sincerely,
Peter

Governor,

 

I just wanted to let you know that our friend Robert Woody from Gainesville has been promoted to a Bureau Chief at Corrections and has come to Tallahassee to serve the administration.  He has hit the ground running and I'm sure will do a fine job for you and the team over here.  From my days in appointments I know that you appreciate when talent is utilized and I thought you would be happy to hear about Robert.

 

I hope you are doing well, please let me know if I can do anything for you.

 

Mike

The approval of Citizens Insurance Corporation’s rate filing occurred this week for multi peril policies including homeowners, mobile homeowners, and dwelling fire.  The rate increases will be effective June 1, 2003 for new homeowners and mobile homeowners policies and August 1, 2003 for renewal policies for homeowners and mobile homeowners.  New dwelling fire policy rates will be effective July 1, 2003 and renewal policy rates will be effective September 1, 2003.  The average overall increase throughout the state is approximately 25.8%, however, some counties in South Florida will have an increase of approximately 45% - 50%.  These policies do not include the wind portion.

Legal Orders Issued:
 
A Consent Order was executed on April 2, 2003 with Capital Health Plan, Inc., formerly known as Capital Group Health Services of Florida, Inc.  This Consent Order enables Capital Health Group, Inc. to use previously filed and approved forms of Capital Group Health Services of Florida, Inc.

A Consent Order was executed on April 2, 2003 with Auto-Owners Insurance Company and Owners Insurance Company.  This case resulted from two (2) rate filings submitted to the Department of Insurance, now the Office of Insurance Regulation, on or about May 9, 2002, by Auto-Owners and Owners.  Auto-Owners and Owners agree to maintain ratemaking data on an accident-year basis separately for each company; submit all filings to include rate level indications that clearly present the indicated change and the proposed change; provide to the Office a detailed explanation for any difference between indicated change and proposed change; incorporate the appropriate use of the concept of credibility in their rate level indications; and prepare each rate filing in accordance with generally accepted and reasonable actuarial techniques.  Auto-Owners and Owners further agree that the next commercial auto based rate filings by Auto-Owners and Owners shall be prepared under the direction of, and certified by, a member of the Casualty Actuarial Society.

As a result of this review, it was determined that Vista failed to pay or deny claims within 120 days in violation of Section 641.3155(4), Florida Statues.  The violation for failing to pay or deny claims within 120 days is a repeat violation as determined and cited in Consent Order Number 60523-02-CO.

A Consent Order was executed on April 3, 2003 with Vista Healthplan, Inc..  A data call for review of prompt payment of claims was submitted for review for the Vista companies including Beacon Healthplans, Healthplan Southeast and Vista.  As a result of the review it was determined that the Vista companies failed to pay claims timely in violation of Section 641.3155(2), Florida Statutes, failed to pay interest on overdue claims in violation of Section 641.3155(3), Florida Statutes, and failed to pay or deny claims within 120 days in violation of Section 641.3155(4), Florida Statutes.

A Consent Order was executed on April 11, 2003 with Total Appliance and Air Conditioning Repairs, Inc.  This company is currently licensed as a service warranty association in this State.  The Office’s examination of this company revealed it failed to maintain a proper warranty register, that the unearned premium reserve was insufficient, that the gross written premium to net assets ratio was inadequate, and that the company’s quarterly financial report was incomplete.  The company has corrected each of these first time violations since the examination and the consent order suspends half of what would otherwise be a $14,000 fine on condition the company strictly complies with Florida Statues and the Florida Administrative Code during a three (3) year probationary period.  Total Appliance will be examined by the Office for each of the next three (3) years and if any examination reveals a material discrepancy between the examination findings and information filed by the company, the company must file annual audited financial statements with the Office for five (5) years thereafter.  
 
A Consent Order was executed on April 11, 2003 with Eagle Insurance Company.  This insurer is a foreign insurer domiciled in the State of New Jersey.  This insurer holds a Certificate of Authority, which is currently suspended pursuant to a Consent Order in Case Number 42530-01-CO, entered on August 23, 2001.  Eagle’s Certificate of Authority was suspended due to unsound financial condition and unprofitable operations.  The August 2001 Suspension Order required Eagle to file with the Office its year 2001 Annual Statement no later than March 1, 2002.  Eagle has failed to file its year 2001 Annual Statement with the Office as required.  Consequently, the Office filed a Notice to Show Cause against Eagle on July 5, 2002.  The Order to Show Cause was personally served on September 3, 2002, the Office received Eagle’s request for an informal proceeding, pursuant to 120.57(2), Florida Statutes.  Along with its request for an informal proceeding, Eagle represented that a plan approved by the Acting New Jersey Insurance Commissioner, issued in Order A02-109, would allow for the solvent run-off of Eagle and its subsidiaries.  Pursuant to the terms of this Consent Order the August 2001 Suspension Order remains in effect.  Thus, Eagle will be permitted to retain its suspended license, and simultaneously have a solvent run-off of its liabilities.  Further, this Consent Order dismisses the Notice to Show Cause issued in this case without prejudice.  
 
A Consent Order was executed on April 11, 2003 with Jon E. Sorensen.  Mr. Sorenson, age 34, of Miami, Florida, was denied a license as a resident company all lines insurance adjuster.  On December 9, 2002, the Bureau of Agent and Agency Licensing issued a Notice of Denial based on the allegations that on September 5, 2002, at a court ordered mediation, Mr. Sorenson acted or held himself out to be an insurance adjuster.  The Notice was amended on January 12, 2003 to add the allegation that on June 12, 2001 the Florida Board of Bar Examiners recommended that Mr. Sorenson not be admitted to the Florida Bar for two (2) years.  Mr. Sorenson filed a response denying the allegations and requesting a hearing.  There was insufficient evidence to prove that Mr. Sorenson acted or held himself out to be an adjuster.  Mr. Sorenson attended the mediation as the insurer’s representative.  Also present at the mediation were the attorney for the insurer, the attorney for the chiropractor who was making a third party PIP claim against the insurer, and the mediator.  The attorney for the chiropractor made the complaint.  Mr. Sorensen was denied admission for two (2) years.  He will thus be eligible for admission on June 12, 2003.  On February 27, 2003, the Office entered into a Settlement Stipulation for Consent Order with the agent.  Under the terms of the agreement, the Office’s Amended Notice of Denial will be rescinded.  Mr. Sorenson will be licensed and will be placed on probation for a period of six (6) months.
 
A Second Notice and Administrative Complaint against Tammy Lane Garland was executed on April 11, 2003.  Tammy Lane Garland, age 45, of Richmond, Virginia, is currently licensed as a Nonresident Property and Casualty Company Adjuster.  This one (1) count Second Notice and Administrative Complaint alleges that on or about September 29, 2002, a First Notice was sent to the licensee informing her that the fingerprint card she had submitted with her license application was illegible and she was instructed to submit another card within thirty (30) days.  Licensee failed to submit a second set of fingerprints as required in the First Notice in violation of Rule 4-211.002(20)(b)3.e., Florida Administrative Code.  This Second Notice and Administrative Complaint will be served on the above-referenced agent in accordance with Section 120.60(5), Florida Statutes.  
 
A Petition for Declaratory Statement for C. Hamilton Boone, P.A.C. and Physician Assistant Services was executed on April 11, 2003.  The Petition for Declaratory Statement has been properly filed with the agency and properly noticed in the Florida Administrative Weekly pursuant to Section 120.565, Florida Statutes.  The Petition requested an opinion of the Office as to whether Physician Assistant Services, Inc., an entity that employs physician assistants and sends them out to render services for surgeons, physicians, etc. qualifies as an employer pursuant to Section 627.419(6), Florida Statutes.  The Declaratory Statement finds that since the statutory language in said section is clear and unambiguous, the plain and ordinary meaning of the word “employer” must be utilized.  As a result, Physician Assistant Services qualifies as an employer, provided all other criteria set forth in Section 627.419(6), Florida Statutes are met.

Subject:	DCA Comments/ UCF Master Plan

Dear Ms. Castille, 
 
As I understand the DCA comments on the UCF Master Plan, there is no environmental objection to what they propose in the conservation areas (!!!);  That UCF has failed to properly manage the area as "gopher tortoise habitat" should not give them carte blanche to mow this area down for frat houses!!!!  There ARE gopher tortoises and, as I've cited till I'm blue in the face, other threatened species on that land---and if, indeed, the buck stops with DCA on this, then I hope DCA is prepared to look at this as it really IS.
 
There WERE plenty of environmental objections even at the public hearing to the planned uses for this land---although it is true that UCF tried its best to suppress public opposition and keep individuals from speaking at the hearing itself.
 
You will shortly be faxed the same multifarious public commentary I have steadily been receiving this past month in favor of preserving that "Preserve" land in perpetuity, as I have also mailed to Gov. Bush. There is no compelling reason to destroy that natural pine woods area---an ecosystem itself quite imperiled in Central Florida. The example UCF would set in so doing is chilling.  Not one of which this state---and its agencies meant to override environmental degradation---can be proud.
 
I URGE you and the DCA and the governor to take some kind of stand here---what might be destroyed so outweighs the human gain (if frat houses replacing exquisite wilderness can be considered a "gain" to anyone but President Hitt and a few frat brothers) the difference cannot be measured.
 
So far I have received no notice of upcoming mediation meetings from Mr. Cambric.
 
Please do not let the DCA rubber-stamp these devastating-to-natural science (and the public) plans the way the Board of Trustees did. It simply is NOT TRUE that this land is not ecologically valuable.
It is classic---and virtually "pristine".
 
Thank you for ANYthing at this point you do to delay the senseless demolition of this treasured (by many) piece of land.
 
Sincerely,
 
Rebecca Eagan

Subject: Por Favor- Need a Quote for tomorrow's release-




Aloha and good morning-We are fine tuning the press release for tomorrow. I would sincerely like a quote from you. We would also be honored to have you name at the top of the distinguished list of Governmental, Business, and Community Leaders who follow. We are finalizing the list today. Mahalo, Randy

South Florida Governmental, Business, and Community Leaders Unite to Lead the USA BID for the Free Trade Area of The America's Bid.

In a unique display of regional unity and showing of togetherness, the leaders of Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach County will gather in Fort Lauderdale next month to kick start the bid for the FTAA Secretariat. South Florida Governmental, Business, Economic Development organizations, and Community leaders will speak as one voice to help secure the valuable basing of the secretariat for Miami.
If the U.S. is successful in bringing the FTAA Secretariat to our home shores, it will unify the Trade Ministers of all 34 nations in our hemisphere under a single roof to exchange international trade and conduct global business. The secretariat could ultimately generate as many as 15,000 new jobs for the region, and stimulate in excess of $500 million in economic international trade, joint ventures, 
Broward's first ever Mayor, Diana Wasserman Rubin, stated "We in Broward are proud to be working should to shoulder with our Dade and Palm Beach partners to help secure the FTAA Secretariat for South Florida. We will dedicate our leadership and political and business resources to help win this bid".
Mayors, Legislators, CEO's, Enterprise Florida and the elected leaders of the business rich South Florida region will gather on May 29th, for "An Evening with International Leaders," at the Fort Lauderdale Marriott to, take the first unity step which will spread statewide and then across the nation under the leadership of Ambassador Chuck Cobb. Broward's own Jorge Arrizurieta, has recently agreed to step down from his prestigious post at the Inter-American Development Bank, to help shepard the operation. This progressive step forward is being coordinated by the International Business Council of South Florida. Incoming Chair Elect, Randy Avon, stated "the outpouring of regional unity is especially gratifying to those of us who have worked and competed in the international business sector for decades. The unified power of 5.5 million high energy South Florida residents combined with our 3 deep water ports, 5 international airports, and thousands of globally based business will send a message to our friends in the hemisphere that South Florida wants their presence."
Miami Dade Mayor Alex Penelas stated "We are extremely proud to have the power and unified forces of Broward and Palm Beach County leaders join in this effort to bring the FTAA Secretariat to Miami".
Florida airports currently handle of 85% of the total air cargo between the U.S. and the nations of Latin America and the Caribbean. In addition, Florida  is the #1 exporter to the nations of Latin America and the Caribbean (excluding Mexico), and has generated over $71 billion in international trade this past year under the leadership of Governor Jeb Bush.
The event will also profile the upcoming America's Business Forum and Free Trade Area of the America's Ministerial meeting coming to Miami November 17th-21st. This impactive meeting is being organized with the cooperation of the regional leaders under the leadership of Ambassador Luis Lauredo and will bring thousands of international business leaders to south Florida for this impactive forum.
Enterprise Florida President/CEO Darrell Kelley, port and airport officials, International State, and national business leaders, tri county political leaders, and other respected community leaders have all confirmed their involvement. The host committee list for the event is a literal "Who's Who of South Florida leaders and the IBC will announce their "Very High Profile" keynote speaker next week.

Dear Governor Bush;
 
We had our meeting, last week with Mr. Bedwell.   I wanted to thank you for making the arrangements that enabled us to have audience with him. 
 
My Vice president, Terry Wilkie and I were very impressed with the Deputy Secretary....  What a great guy!  In addition, he seemed to have good understanding as to the implication of what our technology could mean to Florida and, for that matter, to the country.  I am certain that he will provide you with information concerning this meeting.
 
Again, Governor Bush, I have been impressed with the concern and accessibility of your staff.  I was very pleased with the responses of Pam Dana and Brett Doster (who stays in touch with me on a friendly basis).  Having an administration in touch with the constituency like this is worth everything.......  It certainly is what we need all "governorships" to be engaging in.  This is how things get accomplished.
 
Thank you again for your help.
 
Respectfully yours

Governor Bush,
 
Just wanted to thank you for the autographed pictures for our quiz bowl team.  They really appreciated it.  Also, when Donovan came to our school, he did an excellent job with the kids.  He represents you well.  
 
And, last week I came to Tallahassee with a group for Alachua County Legislative Day and we got a few pictures after your press conference.  One picture was our Leadership Gainesville class director's 14 year old daughter, her friend and you.  They were so excited about that, that next year they want to be messengers. 
 
And lastly, I believe in you.  You may not hear this enough but I think you are doing a great job and I just wanted you to know.    My prayers are always with you and our President.

Subject: Report from Don Gaetz - SARS Update April 14, 2003

This is a brief report to keep you informed as to how we're responding to
the SARS issue in our district.  
 
As you know, a six-year old student at Edge Elementary School in Niceville
is a confirmed case of suspected SARS, as defined by the Centers for Disease
Control.  Under the medical direction of Dr. Karen Chapman, county health
director, we have taken a series of steps to inform families of Edge
students as well as Edge employees and volunteers about SARS and about the
precautions and actions being undertaken.
 
This past Friday, April 11, we received updated guidance from the Centers
for Disease Control and provided that information to members of the Edge
School community.  I also sent the same updates along to you.  Friday
afternoon Dr. Chapman and I met with the Edge faculty for an end-of-week
wrap-up in order to answer questions about the new CDC guidance and to
express our deep appreciation for the steady, sensible, and reassuring
leadership being provided at Edge by Don Varner and the Edge faculty and
staff.
 
At my request, Dr. Chapman stationed public health nurses at Edge Elementary
on Saturday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. to be available face-to-face for parents,
staff, and the public to answer questions, discuss precautions being taken,
or, if needed, to refer persons for immediate medical attention if any
suspicious symptoms were present.  The availability of public health nurses
at Edge on Saturday was well-publicized by hand-outs taken home with
children and front-page coverage in the Daily News.  I'm most grateful to
Dr. Chapman and her staff for this extra extension of their services just in
case anyone wished to talk or needed help.  Dr. McEachern and I spent some
time Saturday morning at Edge with the public health personnel.  The fact
that only two phone calls were received and not one parent or staff member
or citizen came to the school Saturday is evidence of the good work being
done all week long at the school by Ms. Walker, Edge's school nurse, and by
Dr. Chapman's staff.
 
Following all of the publicity associated with SARS, it was possible that
Edge would see a spike in absences.  That hasn't materialized.  Today, there
are 29 students absent at Edge, which Principal Don Varner describes as
"about normal".  To the best of our knowledge, there are two or perhaps
three families who have kept their children at home as a direct result of
the publicity about SARS affecting one student at the school.
 
Based on the appropriate and cautious direction from Dr. Chapman, we are
continuing to monitor all students, faculty, employees, and volunteers at
Edge for either a sustained fever of 100.5 or higher OR a persistent cough
or respiratory problems until Thursday of this week.  At that time, and
absent further guidance from CDC, we will have passed a threshold that
medical authorities say would indicate that SARS symptoms have not been
spread to others at the school.
 
We will continue to post updates from CDC and Dr. Chapman on our website
www.okaloosaschools.com .  
 
Please contact me with any questions, concerns, or suggestions.
 
Thanks so much.

I have heard positive feedback on today's announcement. The Florida Board will have a workshop on fcat and accountability tommorrow afternoon. I am still puzzled by the opposition/reluctance to holding the effecacy of fcat by those that would seem to be the most benefitted. 
Tomorrow is confirmation hearings. I plan to wear very conservative socks
I also received a call from the white house personnel office: asking whether I would be interested in a board related to "scientific education". It sounds interesting, and relates to the standards for no child left behind. It requires senate confirmation. Thank you for whatever assistance you provided

Tallahassee, FLorida 


Dear Governor Bush! 


It was too bad that you weren't there yesterday in Cypress Garden to join the thousands from all walks of life who had come to show their indignation regarding the 'shot gun closing' of Cypress Garden. They were stunned. From all over they had come. Every corner of Florida was represented, Tourists from out of state and international destinations voiced their support to save Cypress Garden. All these people laid to rest, what the developer calls, that Cypress Garden is just a place for the old, out of date with today's world. There were teenagers, young families with their children of every age, young couples, young people of all age groups, and the elderly. In a nutshell, present was America, joined by people from the global village. It was a 'rainbow crowd'. All shared their good memories, precious moments they had experienced whenever they had come to Cypress Garden. 


All of them especially  singled out  the famous unique Botanical Garden, the very core of Cypress Garden with its wealth of rare vegetation in trees and plants. It is indeed a historical landmark of 67 years which is about to be demolished by a developer robbing all of us of a historical treasure. 


There wasn't any warning sign, NO PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT, NO PUBLIC HEARING! On Thursday, April 10th, 2003 in the morning Annual Passes for Cypress Garden were sold. Business as usual. In the evening when the workers left having received their pay envelopes, they found a note that the park, Cypress Garden would close permanently Sunday, April 13th, 2003. Close to 500 people had lost their livelihood! Hearing the news, everyone who treasures and cherishes this beautiful unique historical landmark was and is shocked! 


Dear Governor Bush, on many occasions you have referred to our States as being "My Florida" and have incorporated this feeling of yours into your e-mail address ‘myflorida’ But your Florida, our Florida is under attack losing one of its most precious historical assets. We are a young country compared to Europe or other parts of the world. We do not have too many historical landmarks. In the past, at times, we failed to preserve them and they were lost for good. We simply cannot effort to lose this one. We, our Children, our grandchildren, the nation need this wholesome, beautiful educational environment  preserved for the future. Only you can do it at this point as the public was excluded from any say right from the beginning. Go ahead and make at least the 'Botanical Garden', just 27 acres of 200 acres, of Cypress Garden a State Park! 


The people of Florida, indeed beyond Florida look to you, count on you to take action that we DO NOT LOSE THIS JEWEL OF OUR HISTORICAL HERITAGE TO A DEVELOPER TO LEVEL IT AND PUT IT INTO CONCRETE, LUXURY HOUSES. 


In future years upgrowing generation, your children and grand children, the people of Florida, all will  remember you fondly, when they walk with their loved ones and friends through the unique Botanical Garden as the one who saved it for our common future. 


Come to think of it. It might probably be a very wise idea to come to Cypress Garden and talk with the developer to work out a solution which saves the core of Cypress Garden, the Botanical Garden for the people of Florida and our nation. 


Looking forward to hear from you! 


God Bless!

Dear Governor Bush:
 
The Tierra Verde/Isla del Sol Chamber of Commerce is doing a special presentation to the mother and family of Sgt. Davis at our breakfast meeting on Tuesday, May 6, 2003 at the Isla del Sol Country Club. Kimberly Dale from your local office has already confirmed her attendance. I am writing to make you aware that the funeral for Sgt. Davis is Friday, April 18, 2003 at Arlington National Cemetery. The family is chartering two busses to travel from Tampa to Washington, DC. Of course this becomes expensive. Our chamber will donate funds to defray some of the families unforeseen travel expenses.  Is there a fund from the state or otherwise that can be used to handle the needs of Sgt. Davis large extended family? Please do what you can to help. I know we can always count on you. Feel free to contact me on 727-864-0685 or Bob Davis (Sgt. Davis brother) on 813-416-4806.
 
PS. Bob Davis has stated that the Army has been wonderful during the families time of grief.

it seemed like a easy day to see him because most of the people in Tallahasee

Subject:	Daycare Cut

      Due to the merge of School Readiness Coalicion and Childhood Developement Services (CDS) daycare for the summer months (June,July&August) will be cut for school age children (6yrs TO 12yrs). With only 6 dollars per day toward daycare families with low income and more than one child will be unable to afford daycare like myself as a fosterparent and raising grandchildren bringing home 857 every two weeks and out of that I will have to pay 470 every two weeks for daycare. Lake county is a low income area and parents won't be able to afford daycare so children will be left alone at home or on the street. What can we do about this and is there anything I can do to help? 


                                  Sincerly,

    It has come to my attention that my old friend Clay Simmons has been nominated for a seat on the Circuit Bench in Seminole County.  I have written to your General Counsel giving her my thoughts on Clay, but would like to emphasize to you what a wonderful candidate he is.  A Viet Nam vet, a retired Lt. Col. in the Air Force Reserve, and an outstanding lawyer well thought of in his community.  I urge you to appoint Clay Simmons.

I would like to express the hope that the state of Florida will someday pass legislation to allow nurse practitioners to write prescriptions for scheduled drugs.
I have worked in the state of TN and Florida as a Nurse practitioner- I have a current DEA license but can't use it in this state. I find it quite restricting in my current practice because I work for two general surgeons at the University of Florida.
With the recent efforts to shorten hours that the surgical residents work- they have hired me to help with patient load. Any time that I discharge a patient home I need a physician to write narcotic orders for my patients, talk about ineffiency in the work place.
I sure hope that this issue is addressed so that we can continue to do what is right for the people and patients of Florida.
Thank you

Governor,
 
    As a professor/observer at Saturday's Florida League of Teachers meeting I very much
enjoyed your talk. Clearly, you have command of the facts concerning public education and are pursuing your convictions through policy. Thank you for your support and caring.
 
    I may be the only lifetime Democrat in Florida universities to support your move toward
vouchers. But, while we agree on the medium, I am for vouchers to free learners in this new
technological age. I am presently completing a manuscript, Leaving Schools Behind, in which
the options for accessing learning through technological portals is explored. The only thing
preventing this preferred route to education, I believe, is the fiscal monopoly of our schools.
 
    Have you considered supporting the development of such an option using vouchers?  This
"high end" avenue might stir new interest into  the concept and allow parents to become advocates as consumers.
 
    Please let me know if there is anyone in your administration who might want to explore
the development of "service-oriented" education in Florida using the voucher concept.
 
My best,
 
Jon W. Wiles

To Gov. Jeb Bush

Hello Governor Bush

I had the opportunity to speak with you following the Pro-Literacy
luncheon in Orlando last Friday.  Thank you for your pro-active support
of literacy.

After the luncheon we discussed the need of intervention services for
transitioning offenders in our state.  I shared with you that my sister
had been murdered last year and that I am advocating for intervention
services so that similar crimes might be prevented.  Last July I, along
with a Department of Correction bureau chief, met with the Lt. Governor
concerning this issue.  He liked my ideas and asked that I would write a
proposal which I did.  It is called " Promoting A Successful Transition"
(PAST). You asked me to send you a copy which I am attaching.

I believe that my proposal is fiscally responsible and would ultimately
help reduce the high recidivism factor in our state helping to make
Florida an even better state in which to call home. 

Please take the time to review and comment on this proposal. God bless
you as you continue to lead our state.

Sincerely

Katherine Burns

Dear Governor Bush,

This e-mail communication is being sent as  follow-up to a written letter of invitation dated January 27,2003, and sent to you by our President and CEO, Mr. Kweisi Mfume requesting that you bring  greetings from our State of Fl at the opening session of the 94th Annual Convention of the NAACP to be held at the Convention Center, Miami Beach,July 13,2003.

The NAACP national convention has not been held in Fl since 1980. This is indeed a historic time for all Floridians and in  particular a point of pride for Miami. The NAACP is the last  organization to return to Miami after the tourism boycott  held in  the early 90's.This  year's convention signals  movement towards progress in Miami. Although we know the struggle for freedom, equality, and justice is not over,we do feel that we must pause, at times when it occurs to acknowledge our milestones. It is in  the spirit of movement towards progress that I personally am asking you to attend and bring greetings at the convention, if your schedule permits. 

I have been been in contact with Ms. Wendy Grant from your staff.She has been very helpful in attempting to see if your schedule would allow your attendance.I am hoping that I will see you in July. If you have questions, please feel free to call me at 305 915-4701 or e-mail adoranweze@hotmail.com.

Hello Governor. It has been a while since I sent an email to you. Hope all is well with you and your family. You are continuously in our prayers. 

Kay shared with me the opportunity she had to see and speak with you briefly while she was in Tallahassee a couple of months ago.

It has been brought to my attention that one of your current assistant wardens (I believe that is the appropriate title), Mr. Hill, has been doing an excellent job for the Department of Corrections. He is African-American and is well thought of by those from the public who have interacted with him professionally. He is currently located at the Polk Corrections Facility here in Polk County. I just wanted to pass that along to you in the event there is an opportunity to elevate him to a warden position. 

Thanks for your service and have a blessed day.

I sent him exhaustive investigations and the like to expose organizations like NAMBLA (North American Man/Boy Love Association), PIE (Pedophile Information Exchange) Diaper Dans, Renee' Guyon Society, and a few more.  He (Lawton) I KNOW called up all those who are responsible for receiving mail and had a SPECIAL MEETING to discuss what they would now not allow into those facilities.

I know...I posed as a "boy-lover" and joined the Steering Committee of NAMBLA to find out for myself if and when the Governor really could stop this stuff.  Apparently, as Lawton revealed to me in his personal mail, there WAS an administrative code to do that in this state.  When these inmates were due for release or getting close to, I handed over my "investigation" to the Inspector General and I don't know what happened after that.  It was out of my hands.

I had the pleasure of visiting an elementary school in Brevard today on behalf of you and the Commissioner.  It was a traditional public school which was very impressive - impressive because of the A+ strategies which they were implementing to insure that their students were learning.  They had implemented around two hours a day of research-based reading and language arts.  The teachers were all given their students' test scores (strengths and weaknesses) from the previous school years; they benchmarked sunshine state standards constantly; and they had individual education plans for students scoring below the minimum criteria level.  They had created rather sophisticated systems for tracking standards-mastery and learning-gains.  I asked the principal if, five years ago, she could have imagined doing all of this data collection, analysis and remediation.  She admitted that she could not.  When I asked how the parents and the teachers were accepting this new way of doing business in education, she answered that everyone was working together to continue to improve the process.  They were very proud of being an "A" school, and they all wanted to remain there.  Onward!

Jeb 

Please speak out against these projects and tell them you will use your veto.  The Medically needy and other programs being cut could sure use the 400 million.  We are looking more like our predecessors each day.  If you give notice now, the 400 million won't be a conference issue but rather used for more important state wide programs or a few dollars back to the taxpayer.

God bless.

Legislature 

'Turkeys' may gobble $400-million

Leaders of the Florida House and Senate feud over whether there is enough money for lawmakers' pet projects, and whether the items are needed at all. 

By STEVE BOUSQUET, Times Staff Writer
(c) St. Petersburg Times
published April 15, 2003 

TALLAHASSEE -- House Speaker Johnnie Byrd and his followers boast that their state budget "lives within our means" while leaving out "the pet projects of the past." 

But even as House leaders ration dollars for universities and health care for the poor, they have set aside money for softball fields, water taxis, hybrid-fuel vehicles and police radios. The Senate calls such member-sponsored projects "turkeys" and says they add up to $400-million in spending. 

It's another reason for the two sides to fight. 

"People are directing dollars to their own community, their own city, for their own purpose," said Senate President Jim King, R-Jacksonville. "I'm not saying those purposes are bad. But in a time when we don't have money, to produce $400-million specifically earmarked for your own ends doesn't make any sense." 

Byrd disagrees. He says that money is plentiful and that local projects deserve a place. 

"Legislators are the ones who are elected," Byrd said. "They're the ones who should make the final decisions." 

Individual projects for the five-county Tampa Bay region total $78-million. More than half of that, $45-million, is for the Alzheimer's Center & Research Institute at USF in Tampa. Byrd's father died of Alzheimer's, and he has made finding a cure his top priority. 

Gov. Jeb Bush vetoed nearly $1-billion in projects in his first term. He redefined a turkey to mean projects that were not recommended by a state agency or got no public discussion. 

House Republicans say the Senate budget has turkeys, too, but they are hidden in large lump sums, a charge senators deny. 

"The reality is, they've got money allocated for their own projects," said Rep. Marco Rubio, R-Coral Gables, the House Republican leader. 

Rubio supports one of the biggest House projects: $7-million to buy the historic Freedom Tower in Miami from the influential Mas family and give it to Miami-Dade Community College as a humanities building. 

"Do I think its more important than, say, dentures? Course not," Rubio said. "But if everyone else is going to get something, we should have the right to advocate for it." 

House Republicans also budgeted $10-million for a rail line between Orlando International Airport and tourist destinations, including Disney World. 

Many Democrat-sponsored projects fell by the wayside. 

Rep. Charlie Justice, D-St. Petersburg, failed to secure $1-million to continue buying medications for low-income epilepsy patients, at an average cost per patient of $1,400 a year. 

"It's unbelievable," said Bonnie Skaggs, director of the Suncoast Epilepsy Association. "People with epilepsy could die if they're not taking their medications." 

But the House did set aside $225,000 for Pinellas Park to buy 14 hybrid-fuel vehicles and $121,000 for a tropical aquaculture laboratory in Ruskin. 

House Democrats say Republicans say one thing and do another. "We're not living within our means in the House," said Rep. Chris Smith, D-Fort Lauderdale. "Cut out some of these frivolous projects." 

The House has budgeted $75-million for voter-mandated high-speed rail, but also is considering a bill that asks voters to kill the project. 

The Senate considers the rail money a turkey. 

One of the most talked about House projects is $100,000 to help build a training center for Olympic, international and college softball players for Altamonte Springs, north of Orlando. 

Rep. David Mealor, R-Lake Mary, wrote that the money would match $600,000 in private donations to provide an "endless amount of softball programs." 

The House budget also has a $100,000 grant for mobile radios for Oldsmar, and $250,000 for mobile computer terminals for Tarpon Springs police. 

Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Palm Harbor, defends the radios and terminals. 

"It's a public safety issue," Bilirakis said. "They are in my district, and I have an obligation as a representative to help them out if I possibly can." 

Lawmakers compete every year to snag state dollars for their hometowns, to improve the quality of life and look powerful doing so, too. 

Byrd vowed to be different. 

As the House budget chairman, Rep. Bruce Kyle, R-Fort Myers, said in presenting the budget to members: "When forced to set priorities, we favored the needs of Florida's future over the pet projects of the past." 

Kyle himself got $30-million for seven construction projects at his hometown Edison Community College. 

That includes $706,692 for a "golf course operations building" that the Division of Community Colleges wasn't requesting this year.

Bush challenges students to read



The governor launches Read to Learn as FCAT scores indicate many could repeat third-grade. 


By TIM GRANT, Times Staff Writer 
© St. Petersburg Times
published April 15, 2003 

  _____  


TAMPA -- A group of students at Cahoon Elementary School listened Monday as Gov. Jeb Bush read them Stuart Little and ended the story session with a challenge. 


"Will you read an hour for every hour of television you watch?" he asked. "Except for the weekends. You can take the weekends off." 


The governor used his visit to Cahoon Elementary to announce an initiative called Read to Learn, which he hopes will teach students to read well enough to avoid repeating third grade as a result of reforms he has put in place. 


The law requires third-graders who fail the reading part of the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test to repeat third grade. And based on last year's FCAT results, as many as 50,000, or one-third, of Florida's third-graders could be in jeopardy of failing this year. 


Facing that grim prospect, Bush outlined a program that will help increase the number of third-graders who go to fourth grade. The main elements of his plan include: 


A Summer Reading Camp that will give intensive reading instruction to third-graders who failed the FCAT. Those children who pass an exam at the end of the summer will go to fourth grade. 


Reading mentors will be assigned to each child who attends the reading camps. Struggling readers will be teamed up with volunteers from Big Brothers Big Sisters, AmeriCorps, the Boys & Girls Club and other organizations. 


FCAT Explorer is an interactive Web-based program that will be launched in June and targeted for struggling third-grade readers. Designed as a game in outer space, the program will make learning to read a fun activity. 


Workshops for parents to help them help their children. 


Extra training for 6,000 teachers to help struggling third-grade readers and high school seniors who have not passed the 10th-grade FCAT. 


"The era of social promotion in Florida has ended," Bush said. "There is no job in the future of this state, of any worth, that does not require higher literacy skills." 


Bush said up to $41-million is available for the Read to Learn initiative from a combination of state and federal funds. A $300-million federal grant will fund teacher training in more effective methods. 


Education Secretary Jim Horne said the state has about 1-million students struggling with reading. He said the percentage of students reading below grade level increases from 45 percent in Grade 4 to 65 percent in Grade 10. 


"We believe we need an action plan," Horne said, adding that the state also will offer an intensive fast-track summer GED program aimed at 12th-graders who did not pass the 10th-grade FCAT. 


A spokesman for the state teachers union questioned how the proposal would work and whether there was enough money to fund it. 


Tony Welch of the Florida Education Association said the union doesn't question that some students need extra help. "There's clearly attention that needs to happen there." 


But with summer school programs across the state "drastically cut" the past few years, the FEA "questioned how effective this might be," Welch said. "It might shape up as the not-so-complete fix." 


Bush said Read to Learn is not "tough love without the love." And he hopes parents will be outraged enough to get involved with their children's education. 


"There should be a sense of relief that their child is important enough that they are not being thrown away," Bush said. "It's up to us to close the gap so that a broader number of students can be part of Florida's future and not a drain on its resources."

As previously indicated, Lucy has a few schedule doctors appointments on May 14th. I think that Milton will also be out of town during those days, so Lucy will need PCA services in excess of those that she receives under the DS waiver.  I understand that the 7.5 PCA service hrs. that she used during our last January 22 - 24 ADAWG board meeting were denied. See attached invoice. I have repeatedly requested reconsideration to that decision, and copy of ADA accommodations for reason of affiliation.  

It is my honor and privilege to serve in the Governor's ADAWG board, but I believe that board members are entitled to expenses reimbursements. Lucy's in home support is a qualified reimbursable expense, which constitute a reasonable accommodation by reason of affiliation under the ADA.  

Again, please assist in getting a prompt resolution to this matter.

FDOT does not have permitting authority over the trees/ (R/W) in question.

There was a very detailed article in Saturdays Herald regarding this issue.
As I understand it, the Grand Prix organizers are modifying the race course
to provide more room in the PITS, requiring the relocation of some Palms
that are in the middle of Biscayne Blvd. This median area is controlled by
the City/Off Street Parking (not DOT R/W).

 According to the article, the tree relocation was news to a few
Commissioners and the Mayor.  I am certain that the Palm relocations will
be subject to further consideration by the City.

Dear Honorable Governor Jeb Bush

The Florida Federation of Garden Clubs (FFGC), Charter Members of the
National Garden Clubs (NGC), are 19,800 members strong.   NGC and FFGC
deliver a daily message that trees make the air we breathe, provide us
with
beauty, and sustain us with food and shelter.

We are concerned about a proposal to destroy the royal palms that line
Biscayne Boulevard in downtown Miami.   These palms distinguish our City
of
Miami with beauty and elegance.  No other city in the world has such a
beautiful and graceful look.

The City of Miami should nurture this long life of beauty within our
community.  Please do not allow the City of Miami to destroy our quality
of
life for a three-day car race that should be held in Homestead's Race
Car
Stadium.

Subject:	Mobilization of the "Buchanan Sisters": 144th Transportation Company/Marianna


Dear Ms. Miner:

Thank you for your recent note to the Governor concerning Cristina, Jessica,
and Melissa Buchanan, members of the 144th Transportation Company, Florida
National Guard.  Governor Bush reviewed your email message and has asked me
to respond on his behalf.

I have talked with these great young women on several occasions and each
time their pride in serving their country through the National Guard was
evident.  Your sincere concern for them is appreciated, but please set your
mind at ease.  Cristina, Jessica, and Melissa each successfully completed
Basic and Advanced Training and met the rigorous standards set by our armed
forces.  In fact, many Active Duty soldiers in Iraq today have less
experience than these outstanding female soldiers.  Like other young men and
women from the Guard, they understand the risks of military service -- but
never hesitated to answer our nation's call.  As General Eric Shinseki,
Chief of Staff-United States Army, has said: "Soldiering is an issue of the
heart"

In reference to your question concerning Army protocol governing assignment
of family members to the same unit, none of our military services have
established those family-specific regulations.  We have, for example, in the
144th  a set of twins and a father and son team.  As an aside, about half
the company is female.  More than 35% of the soldiers are attending college.
More to the point, the Buchanan sisters want to serve together and we
believe their wishes should be respected.  

With regard to the deployment of forces, you indicate a unit from the Panama
City area was activated "early."  Actually, this particular unit was alerted
for mobilization almost nine months after the Active Duty units now leading
the fight in Iraq.  Our country had to have ready contingent forces at the
mobilization station as the day and time of the Iraq invasion was in flux
pending outcome of the complex negotiations and mediations between
Washington and our allies.

In closing, let me assure you our Guard soldiers must meet the same criteria
as their Active Duty counterparts.  About 100 Florida National Guard
soldiers recently returned from Afghanistan and 14 were awarded Bronze Star
medals -- a huge validation of their leadership, courage, and
professionalism.  Many of them junior enlisted members of the Army Guard.

We know you wish Cristina, Jessica, and Melissa, as well as our other young
men and women who have been called to duty, a safe return.  Thank you for
your continuing support.


Best personal regards,

Doug Burnett

---------- Forwarded Message ----------









Dear Ann,
Thank you for your rational response.  This is the type of discussion that 
the redesign group should be having: proposing solutions to legitimate 
concerns. This is a great suggestion. With your permission I would like to 
distribute this to all.

Emotionally charged responses only create more issues that are not germane 
to the legitimate issues of service delivery.  We all agree on 
self-determination and consumer choice.

I assure you that I am not trying to splinter the DD community.  I have been 
unfairly accused and I am definitely not an unfortunate person.  I have a 
responsibility to those I represent, many of which rely on providers, an 
integral part of the system delivery.

Based upon what I am experiencing currently with Maximus, I know better than 
anyone that we must implement this design.   However, there must be an 
understanding of the effects on all parties involved, parents, consumers, 
and providers alike.

Let us just take a look at one provider and apply the real Mercer rates.  
Why haven’t they at least done that?  Lets calculate and determine the true 
effect it will have on developmentally disabled people.  Why is that such an 
unreasonable request?

I know that advocating carries with it a passion that we all have and I 
respect it.  But I am very disappointed that there is not a more 
professional decorum.  Philosophical differences should not be construed as 
fighting.  Understanding the nuances of this complex system is difficult for 
the professionals that administer it; parents (myself included) no matter 
how brilliant, may not anticipate the dire consequences for many 
developmentally disabled consumers that rely on providers daily.

Because I’ve seen so many compelling incidents, I am not one of the 
department’s biggest fans and I am not trying to win a popularity contest 
(have you noticed?). I have read some of the posts and am embarrassed that 
the legislature has been sermonized about self-determination.  WE ALL AGREE 
ON SELF-DETERMINATION AND CONSUMER CHOICE.

With all due respect, lets intelligently  address the valid concerns and 
stop the unnecessary sermons and name-calling. BTW thanks for the prayers, 
I’ll take them any way I can get them.

Susan:
	I wrote Gary B. of the Advocacy Center last night requesting: "Can there be
any negotiating with FARF to implement a 90 day grievance procedure (perhaps
thru Advocacy Center) for justification of costs procedure for providers?

As a parent trying to represent families in our area, I feel ARF could have
some legitimate issues.  The redesign must happen in Florida, but I see no
safeguards for consumers.  This is important!"

	He said he would "pass it on."  My concern is that this does not splinter
the DD community.  We can develop a grievance procedure, we can listen to
each other.

	I too am concerned, as we all should be.  ARF has gotten our attention.
Are we listening?  This can be resolved.  Now let's get to work on it.

	Again, I cannot reinforce enough, we cannot appear or be splintered
(separate/fighting).  We will not benefit with the legislators if this
continues and the consumer will feel the consequences!

Connie Mack’s Statement on Victims Compensation Ballot Initiative

 

 Tallahassee—Representative Connie Mack said today that Floridians for Good Government, Inc. will announce a project to sponsor a ballot initiative to make sure that the victims of personal injury and medical malpractice cases get their fair share of the compensation awarded to them.  An official announcement will come in the next few weeks.

 

"For far too long, the victims have not received their fair share of the jury awards.  The trial lawyers have taken an unfair portion of those awards," Representative Mack said.  "I believe we need to make sure the victims, not the lawyers, receive the compensation they're due.  This ballot initiative will be successful because it is the right thing for the victims who have suffered for too long."

 

The ballot initiative will be on the ballot in November of 2004.

 

Connie Mack is Chairman of Floridians for Good Government, Inc., a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting responsible and efficient government through public policy reforms that strengthen families, promote economic growth and prosperity, and improve the lives of every Floridian.

Mary Robinson is a good County Court Judge who has been a dedicated public servant for many years.  She will make an excellent Circuit Court Judge. We encourage you to appoint her to the Circuit Court in Broward County.

Thank you for your consideration.

April 15, 2003

Dear Sir:

Thank you for responding to my concern about the Buchanan sisters.  I have worried about their safety and do wish all of our soldiers a safe return.  My friend's son was actually transferred to the Tallahassee National Guard unit from the Panama City one and is now serving in the Middle East, I believe near Baghdad.  We pray for his safe return also.

I do think the military should consider establishing a policy to send relatives to different areas - despite their personal wishes to serve together.  It would be too great of a tragedy for a family to suffer, to lose several members of a family at one time.

Thank you for you reply and for your service also.

Sincerely,

Barbara Miner

Sent from the Internet 




Dear Ms. Miner:

Thank you for your recent note to the Governor concerning Cristina, Jessica,
and Melissa Buchanan, members of the 144th Transportation Company, Florida
National Guard.  Governor Bush reviewed your email message and has asked me
to respond on his behalf.

I have talked with these great young women on several occasions and each
time their pride in serving their country through the National Guard was
evident.  Your sincere concern for them is appreciated, but please set your
mind at ease.  Cristina, Jessica, and Melissa each successfully completed
Basic and Advanced Training and met the rigorous standards set by our armed
forces.  In fact, many Active Duty soldiers in Iraq today have less
experience than these outstanding female soldiers.  Like other young men and
women from the Guard, they understand the risks of military service -- but
never hesitated to answer our nation's call.  As General Eric Shinseki,
Chief of Staff-United States Army, has said: "Soldiering is an issue of the
heart"

In reference to your question concerning Army protocol governing assignment
of family members to the same unit, none of our military services have
established those family-specific regulations.  We have, for example, in the
144th  a set of twins and a father and son team.  As an aside, about half
the company is female.  More than 35% of the soldiers are attending college.
More to the point, the Buchanan sisters want to serve together and we
believe their wishes should be respected.  

With regard to the deployment of forces, you indicate a unit from the Panama
City area was activated "early."  Actually, this particular unit was alerted
for mobilization almost nine months after the Active Duty units now leading
the fight in Iraq.  Our country had to have ready contingent forces at the
mobilization station as the day and time of the Iraq invasion was in flux
pending outcome of the complex negotiations and mediations between
Washington and our allies.

In closing, let me assure you our Guard soldiers must meet the same criteria
as their Active Duty counterparts.  About 100 Florida National Guard
soldiers recently returned from Afghanistan and 14 were awarded Bronze Star
medals -- a huge validation of their leadership, courage, and
professionalism.  Many of them junior enlisted members of the Army Guard.

We know you wish Cristina, Jessica, and Melissa, as well as our other young
men and women who have been called to duty, a safe return.  Thank you for
your continuing support.


Best personal regards,

Doug Burnett

Governor, I respectfully give my highest recommendation to Circuit Judge 
Harvey Kornstein for the pending appointment to the Second District 
Court of Appeal.  I have known Harvey since 1980 when we served together 
in the Air Force.  Judge Kornstein was a Reserve Officer serving at 
MacDill Air Force Base while I served as the Deputy Staff Judge 
Advocate.  As such, I have the opportunity and privilege to work with 
Judge Kornstein on a monthly basis.  His work was the finest I have ever 
seen.  This is a man of integrity and honor who would represent the 
citizens of the 2d District with distinction.  He epitomizes all that we 
seek from our system of justice.  

Since 1996, Judge Kornstein and I have served together as Military 
Judges.  Once again, he has served with both honor and distinction. 
 This is exactly the sort of Judge we desire in Florida.  It is my 
sincere hope that you and your staff will agree with my assessment and 
Judge Kornstein will receive this appointment.

Dear Jeb,

Hope all is well with you and your family.

Wanted to thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule to play 
golf with Matt Ross tomorrow.  What a nice thing for you to do!

His mom asked me to come along to help articulate some of the important 
issues for which the Autism Society of Florida has been advocating. 
Unfortunately, I cannot make it.

I told her that you probably already knew our issues as well as I.

We have tried to get coverage for therapeutic intervention (speech, OT, and 
behavioral therapy) for many years HB 169 & SB84.  We have agreed to a cap 
of $500 per month which is the standard in several other states.  Currently 
it would only effect those still on the waiting list for Med waiver 
services.  Shelly tells me it is 1315 persons.  After backing out the self 
insured, erisa policies, etc., it totals approximately $4 million in direct 
costs to the industry.

They've already spent close to that on lobbyists to fight it.

I was told by one of their lobbyists last week that I was like a 'bad penny' 
that kept coming back.  I told him that he should be thanking me for keeping 
him employed.  Now I know why they fight it so hard, it's an annuity for 
them.

This is really the biggest issue, the DOE is also lacking in the same 
services, on a less intense scale. There is little therapeutic intervention 
for children with autism, even to meet minimum criteria for functioning in 
the classrooms.

The TIP program is serving 93 of the most severe elementary aged children 
with some on the wait list. This is a very important funding issue for us.

I am sure you know the needs, our parents are not bashful.

Again, have a great time tomorrow...maybe you should ask for shots.

I should invite you to play in the Community Drivers Children's Golf 
Challenge this year.  It will be at Don Shula's on November 13, 2003.  We 
have many elected officials as the 5th player in every foursome.  Last year, 
our first, we raised over $50,000 for the autism programs at ARC.  Our title 
sponsors are Publix and First Fleet Leasing. Let me know if you would 
consider it.

p.s. The golf license plate has raised over $63,000 in 4 months.  Did you 
get yours yet?  You can call (and even get a vanity plate) over the phone, 
our special toll free number:  877 GOLF-TAG.

p.s.s.  Don't forget to get pictures tomorrow, I will put them on the 
Florida Junior Golf Council website.

Regards,
Susan

Received a call today from Jerry Mallot and John Haley.  Project Velvet is progressing very nicely.  Jacksonville has been invited to come to California and do their Powerpoint presentation for about 100 corp hqtr persons who would probably be invited to relocate if the project comes to Jacksonville.  The company may leak the possible corporate headquarter re-lo to the press and see how Wall Street reacts.  Hopefully, that will be positive.
 
Incidentally, Bill Foley put a contract on Tom Petway's house and the vacant lot adjacent to Tom's house.  Can we read anything into that?

Thank you for taking the time out of your schedule to be in
Tallahassee

today. The issues we discussed are both complex and challenging and
your

meeting moved the process along in ways you are probably unaware of. I
ask

you to be a continued voice of reason on these issues, which
ultimately
we

will face together. 

First, the medical malpractice issue is about everyone's fundamental
right

to the access of care. This is an issue that has potential to implode;
it

is a reality and not a political game. Second, the workers comp issues

touches us all and should be a top priority of business. Third, I urge
you

to continue encouraging your legislators to trust the marketplace and

realize the easy answer of more taxation will ultimately fail us.
Finally,

I know you understand how a budget works. You probably understand
better

than anyone in the legislature and budget wise Enterprise Florida
funding is

paramount in developing and diversifying our economy. There seems to
be
an

attitude of doom and gloom here in Tallahassee, while when I am in
places

like Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville, and Miami people are continuing to
be

upbeat while facing everyday challenges. I hope you continue to engage
and

I look forward to seeing you soon. Should you have any follow up items

-----Department of Homeland Security Advisory No. 03-017

 

 

Following a review of intelligence and an assessment of threats by the intelligence community, the Department of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Homeland Security Council, has made the decision to lower the threat advisory level to an elevated risk of terrorist attack, or "yellow" level.  

 

In conjunction with this action, we plan to stand down from Operation LIBERTY SHIELD over the next several days; however, we must maintain vigilance that is in keeping with the elevated risk that exists.    

 

Operation LIBERTY SHIELD provided an opportunity to apply a focused National level  effort aimed at deterring terrorists from attacking our homeland.  The operation was conducted in conjunction with the heightened threat level of Orange that provided an even greater level of security.  We have all learned from LIBERTY SHIELD.  For this reason, the Secretary of Homeland Security has tasked his agencies and requested other Federal agencies to closely examine protective measures that were employed during Operation LIBERTY SHIELD and to assess their applicability in a modified form under the Homeland Security Advisory System's Threat Level Yellow.  Further guidance will be provided to state and local government officials on this matter shortly.  For example, visible presence is a viable form of deterrence.  Under Threat Level Yellow, the use of random or rolling patrol operations can be effective in signaling to terrorists that their chances of succeeding are minimal and terrorist operations may be disrupted and prevented.

  

During the LIBERTY SHIELD operation, the Department of Homeland Security, working closely with the FBI and the CIA, evaluated threats from all sources and provided threat information to state and local governments, private sector owners and operators, and the public. While the effectiveness of LIBERTY SHIELD is difficult to measure, we do know that visible presence is an effective deterrent and actions taken during LIBERTY SHIELD may have disrupted and prevented terrorist activities.

 

Yellow is still a state of elevated alert and we need to continue our vigilance in order to ensure the security of our homeland. Of note, April 19 marks the anniversary of both the Waco fire and the Oklahoma City bombing and is a date significant to the agenda of antigovernment individuals.  Our ability to assess threats requires timely information.  Continued reporting from State/local and private sectors is critical in creating a national threat profile.  The Department of Homeland Security encourages reporting of suspicious activities during all threat levels.

=============================================================
Tampa Tribune
GOP Senator Opposing Latest Phone Proposal
Published: Apr 16, 2003 

Republican state Sen. Nancy Argenziano of Dunnellon announced Tuesday that she will oppose a telecommunications bill that she says will raise local phone rates and force many elderly people to give up their telephone service. 
Senate Bill 654 cleared the Communication and Public Utilities Committee on a vote of 8-1 this week. Proponents say increased local access charges will increase competition, which will result in long-term savings for consumers. The proposal includes new safeguards, including greater oversight from state regulators, that were not in the bill Gov. Jeb Bush vetoed last year. 
But Argenziano, whose opposition could infuriate GOP leaders, said the bill will allow companies to boost the average monthly bill by as much as $7.25 in the next two years and then increase rates by 20 percent a year. Other parts of the bill would curb the Public Service Commission's ability to deny rate increases, she said. 
``This doesn't seem to be a very consumer-friendly bill,'' said Argenziano, joined by advocates for consumers and the elderly. ``Somebody needs to put the brakes on this one.''

Governor –

 

In the discussions about the affordable housing trust funds and the role that they should play in helping to balance the state budget, there has been a lot said in recent weeks about the value of the programs and whether they are being administered appropriately.

 

I would be happy to help with those broader policy discussions in any way that I can. I understand that there will be a fiscal impact on the programs, I’d just like to minimize unnecessary collateral damage to Florida Housing and the work that it does.

 

Thanks.

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY

Office of the Press Secretary
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
April 16, 2003


STATEMENT BY HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY TOM RIDGE

THREAT LEVEL LOWERED

Following a review of intelligence and an assessment of threats by the
intelligence community, the Department of Homeland Security, in
consultation with the Homeland Security Council, has made the decision
to lower the threat advisory level to an elevated risk of terrorist
attack, or "yellow level."

While we continue to be at risk to the threat of terrorism at an
elevated level, extensive protective measures remain in place throughout
our nation.  As Secretary Rumsfeld has noted, hostilities from Operation
Iraqi Freedom still continue and there is, "a lot of work left to do."
We must be vigilant and alert to the possibility that al-Qaida and those
sympathetic to their cause, as well as former Iraqi-regime state agents
and affiliated organizations, may attempt to conduct attacks against the
U. S. or our interests abroad.

In particular, I extend my grateful appreciation to the Governors,
Mayors and other representatives from the public and private sector for
their tremendous support and cooperation throughout the last several
weeks.  I also applaud the hard work of the many dedicated law
enforcement officials, security personnel and responders for their
efforts to shield our nation.   They have protected our freedom at home
in this time of war while their brave counterparts in our armed forces
are fighting for this same cause thousands of miles away in Operation
IRAQI FREEDOM.

The signal we have sent our enemies over the past few weeks has been
clear.  We will continue to resolutely defend our Nation and its
freedom.

Thanks for writing.  I agree with you that not agreeing with someone doesn't constitute lack of friendship, love or relationship.  I wonder where Milton and I will be if that was the case. We have disagreements, but we respect, support, and love each other regardless. I think that disagreeing can be healthy.  Can you imagine if we all thought alike?  

On the other hand, I do think that FARF didn't acted properly by going to the legislators before bringing the issues to the table. The 100 questions were never presented to the group.  

The redesign team has not agree with all of Mercer's recommendations. We are vigilant. Mercer has made adjustments and changes with the group's input. We are still discussing rate and other issues. The cost guidelines tool will not apply to individuals with greater challenging needs.  Those will continue to have cost exceptions. I too have great concerns with the Prior Service Authorization process and the medical necessity requirements. I have brought it to the table, but we haven't had much time to address it yet.  I hope that we can do it soon.

Berthy:

First of all, I do advocate for all disabilities. But, I also have a duty to advocate for Autism, since I am the president of the Autism Society of Florida. 

I know this redesign is a very delicate subject and I understand that not everyone can agree all the time. I am not against the redesign. I never personally attacked anyone even though a certain persons did attack me (without mentioning my name). 

Our concern is about the rate compression and its effect on the services of our more severe children. All we want is to be sure that providers (large or small) are protected from cuts in their rates, if they are serving the kids with severe issues. My understanding is that when Mercer was asked by the Senate committee, "What effect will this have on families? Mercer said, "It is robbing Peter, to pay Paul." If this is true, why would anyone just agree with the rate compression without first making sure it will not negatively impact families or providers? I think that if you have all of the facts, then you can make an intelligent decision. To have the attitude that "big providers are greedy and only want more money is not fair. I do not work for FARF as I was accused of and I don't appreciate it when someone questions my loyalties. I don't go around behind peoples backs. I am not saying you did. You know who I am speaking of. 

In the case of children with Autism, there are not many providers that will even serve them, so you can understand our concern for wanting to make sure the ones that do are not going to stop because their rates are cut by this compression issue. 

I agree with self advocating, community based care and most everything else. I even would agree with rate compression, if we were sure it would be the right thing. I am just not sure, yet. I do not agree with the  "one size fits all" mentality of some people. Some of our children cannot be served in a group home with supports, some of our children need 24 hour care and whether that be in a community based setting or not, is up to the family, not other people. 

In closing, I would like to work together, but some people refuse to. Again, you know who I am speaking of. If you don't agree with her, you are her enemy. My advise is to be careful who you associate with. She may be your friend, but that doesn't mean you have to agree with everything a friend says. I am not telling you what to do. I am only saying that you can be guilty by association, if you know what I mean. Again, please don't take it the wrong way. I agree with much of what she says, but not all of it. Since I don't agree with all of it, I am a "lackey of the system," "a big provider supporter," etc. These were her words, not mine. I don't think that everything has to be black and white. It doesn't all have to be my way or no way. 

Hi to Milton. Thanks for writing and I hope we can move forward and do more great things for our kids, together in the future. 

This is also personal and please do not forward.

Regards, 

Ven

Subject: RE: RE: RE:


Governor & Mr. Secretary:

Regarding whether I agree with your points:

First, Audubon does not believe that there is any objective need for this legislation.

Second, we believe that by supporting this legislation and amending the EFA, you are vacating agreements reached between the State and Federal Government to mitigate pollution in the Everglades Protection Area (to enforce state water law).  That is a fundamental, consensus pre-requisite for Everglades restoration, and the bill represents a unilateral changing of the rules.  Someone else can and no doubt will interpret the legalities of this.

Third, we believe that by abandoning the consensus findings achieved through the 1996 GCSSF "Conceptual Plan" which was codified by WRDA 1996 as the blueprint for the Restudy and CERP, the State is not living up to its end of the bargain and (more importantly) not holding the various sides to their agreements.  I was personally told long ago that your administration intends to hold people to their word.  Not doing so here sets a precedent.  

The Everglades restoration process started long before any of us three were engaged, and your comments, David, regarding a "long ago commission" (and by extension a "long ago WRDA?") insult a great many players in the GCSSF/WRDA processes, especially the great majority who feel some obligation that they were bound by their word.  "Honrar, honra," as Jorge Dominicis said to me 19 months ago, and that has generally been at the back of my mind in this process.

Fourth, you state that you do not support those who seek a delay in reaching a standard.  Then you'll agree that we should all oppose this legislation, stick with the current 2006 deadline, and work towards consensus (holding everyone's feet to the fire on ALL of their commitments) on a peer-reviewed, objective scientific process to get to 10 (if 10 can't be reached over the coming 3 years, then find a strong, defensible scientific path to get there).  This legislation is not necessary to achieve this, and substitutes political mandate for scientific process.

Fifth, Audubon does not speak for Congress.  Various Congresspersons on both sides of the aisle are speaking for themselves.  We have heard several members of your administration suggest that the State can and maybe should "go it alone" on CERP.  That would be disastrous, and I hope that you understand why.  Should the federal government fund CERP, even if the State is proposing unilateral change on this issue?  Should they go ahead and fund CERP, but federally enforce the CWA in Florida?  CERP has many doubters, Audubon not among them.  You've read all the press from DC over the past several years.  I can't predict which of many options the federal government may choose, or who will propose what.

However, trust, especially in bipartisan form, is a fragile entity.  Audubon strongly believes that some strategic errors have been made here in the planning and execution of this strategy.  That is what I meant by the bigger strategy (not yours) being to delay CERP: first plant the seeds of mistrust...  Audubon certainly hopes that we can see CERP fully funded and implemented IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AGREEMENTS AND PRE-REQUISITES WE ALL ENDORSED IN GETTING CERP AUTHORIZED.  The Federal government has always been, and should always be an a priori partner in all aspects of this process, not called on afterwards to ask for buy-in.

Last, regarding the 2001 study that uses data from 92-98 and is then represented by 
Charles as current conditions, the data should be reviewed regarding trends in loss of viable Everglades habitat.  I was told that David presented this figure to a committee as 2 acres PER YEAR, which is ridiculously low, and that I agreed with him (which I DO NOT).  Absolutely, this is a myth that needs to be put to bed: it's much higher than that, and we all know it!  But more importantly, permitting pollution levels that cause a change in native flora and fauna is not legal...you know that better than I do.

My advice on this issue has been freely given from the start of the Legislative session, but the process leading up to this bill pre-dates that by some time, as you know.  I've been quite consistent in predicting where this would end up, and, unfortunately, that's where it seems to be going.  I would still strongly suggest pulling the plug and getting back to objectivity and science: call on rational, objective thinkers and they will respond to a well-formulated alternative to this needless legislation.  Let's not end-run the public process that got us this far in Everglades restoration.

Regards,

Stuart

If not, would be helpful to learn why.

Regarding this morning, Charles -- with our help -- won four important changes/
improvements to the bill before the Senater NR committee.  You are welcome 
for that.

Regarding the 2001 study that uses data from 92-98 and is then represented by 
Charles as current conditions, I am convinced that we might have finally shut 
down that mythology this morning.  I am sorry we had to do it  in public, but you 
never sent me the letter you promised to correct Audubon's record on the 
current rate of cattail expansion.

I have to continue to advise you as a friend that you really should be here in 
person for this.  I am completely rearranging my schedule on a daily basis for 
this.  It is important.

Dear Mr. Bush,

I am writing on behalf of my elderly grandmother, Jean Chindlund. She asked that I drop you a line letting you know just how grateful she is for the above mentioned program and the services they provide to her and to so many in our area.

She is 88 years old and though she is is good health,  she still has a difficult time getting out and around. She also lives on the tight budget that her fixed income allows.

Having her meals and weekly breakfast box, with fresh fruit,  milk and juice,plus a hot meal daily, delivered to her door is a tremendous contribution to her lifestyle.

We both know that many social services agencies budgets have been adversely affected due to budget re-appropriations since 9/11. However, we also know that the services provided to the community by agencies such as The Southwest Social Services Program, probably do not cost that much to supplement and are invaluable resources for the community.

It is our sincerest hope that you will advise your staff to maintain the funding of quality programs such as these,  for the benefit of Southwest Miami's elderly population, many of which do not have families nereby, are suffering from debilitating medical conditions or do not have a convenient mode of reliable transportation so as to purchase the staples provided.

Thank you for your time, attention and understanding of this matter.

Best Regards,

Dear sir or Madam;
We would like to go on record as being against this telephone legislation that would increase base rates. There is absolutely no justification for this legislation. No one should use potential lowering of long distance costs as a justification for increasing base rates on local telephone service. This is absurd. 
Long distance rates should stand on their own and if they cannot compete with phone cards and cell phones, they should go out of business. Let us not look at subsidizing long distance service companies, nor local ones.
This legislation is a disservice to your constituents. Vote "NO" on this legislation.

Promises Promises Promises But once again teachers are getting shafted. Now you want to take the bonus pay away from teachers because they have NBPTs certification unless they can mentor fellow teachers and of course it must be attached to test scores because if not we are incompetent. I have taken the NBPTS "test" for the third time, it is very hard, I have also paid 1,200 of my own money to do retakes, and now if I earn NBPTS certification, I don't even know if I will be rewarded, in my district it is very hard to mentor fellow teachers, there is hardly any turn over here so new teachers are very rare.

However, you have now been sent a name for consideration for Judge Craig Villanti's Sixth Judicial Circuit Court seat that I feel very strongly about, Joan Vecchioli.  I have know Joan since I was a runner at the law firm where she is now a partner, and she exemplifies all of the qualities you look for in a judge.

Good evening Governor. This is Chuck Vaughn in Jacksonville.  I emailed you just before the election last year and am very pleased with the outcome.  

The reason for this note is at your direction, the CFS contacted me just before Thanksgiving, and I supplied them a detailed book on my case against them.

Sec. Reigert in writing told us he had no interest in pursuing this prior to your intervention.  We have not been able to have any consistent contact with the department, his office regularly ignores Rep. Stan Jordan's calls and requests.  This has gone on for 6 months now.  Our patience has come to an end.  

I would appreciate your office lighting a fire under his office and resolving this matter.I supplied them with every piece of paperwork they have since 1987 and cannot seem to schedule a meeting due to a "protocol" they will not explain to us. The amount in question is under the legislative cap per 762.28 p 5.

On another subject, I work with a technology that has EPA approval, and has demonstrated reductions of SO2 37%, NOX 10%, and Carbon Monoxide up to 90%.
This product, Soltron, works in all types for fuels, from gasoline, diesel and bunker oil.  The reason I point this out is the President has requested a 70% reduction in SO2 in the next few years, we can get him 1/2 the way there right now. 

Progress Energy's Anclote Plant,outside Tampa has major problems and they are interested in testing our product.  We could use some help with the EPA on getting a waiver on their fuels permit.  Your input would be welcome.  Soltron would also be valuable in mass transit from municipal busses to cities and cruise ships and the like with large storage tanks, and back up generation. General Burnett, who I know is also very intersted, but he has been busy of late.    Information on request.

Best wishes for a safe Easter,

Jeb:

After David's visit to congressional offices today to explain his position,
congressmen Shaw and Goss issued the press release copied below. 

Clay Shaw and Porter Goss are two Republican congressmen who bear neither
you nor David any ill will.  It can no longer be credibly suggested that
they are mis-informed. They have now heard at length everything David has
to say; this following last week's "briefing team" which David dispached to
DC carrying the same messages.

As suggested by Clay Shaw and Porter Goss, this situation cries out for a
"time out" during which the appropriate representatives of DEP/SFWMD/Your
Office, and Interior, U.S. Justice Dept. and EPA meet to determine how to
work out the important issues. 

You could (and should)exercise your leadership to invite representatives of
these agencies to Tallahassee, and engage in the same kind of collaborative
process that led to the passage of the Everglades Forever Act in 1994.

While time to do this grows short in the Regular session of the
Legislature, I think it is becoming obvious that the Legislature is likely
to "come back" for an extended or special sesson to deal with budget
issues.  Further, because NOTHING will be enforced under the existing law
of the Everglades Forever Act until December 31, 2006, we have three more
legislative sessions after this one to deal with any real need to amend the
Everglades Forever Act if a true consensus determines that needs to be
done. 

The point is that Everglades progress made so far has ALWAYS emerged from
consensus when EVERYONE was in the room with proper notice and opportunity
to work things out.  Why is this different?

If you will take the actions necessary to bring the proper federal and
state parties together, I will do everything I can to press every element
in the environmental community to cooperate with that process. 

Charles

Joint Statement from Congressmen Shaw and Goss on Meeting with Secretary
Struhs 

Washington, D.C. - Today we met with Secretary David Struhs to further the
dialog between the state and their federal partners on a recent Everglades
bill being considered in the Florida Legislature. We were pleased to hear
that the Governor's office remains committed to holding the line on
standards and time lines set for water quality by 2006. 

We remain steadfast, however, in our determination that any changes being
considered to any Everglades related legislation must be made with full
transparency. It is therefore our continued recommendation that the Florida
Legislature table this flawed bill at this time. We cannot over emphasize
the fact that to do otherwise would seriously jeopardize the federal
dollars that are ultimately needed to ensure our mutual goal - the
restoration of the Florida Everglades. 

While consensus is certainly possible, it can only be reached when both
partners work together towards that goal without the influence of special
interests. We welcome all stakeholders to the table to present their case
in the months to come.

Dear Gov. Bush:

Lights along various sections of I-95 in Miami-Dade continue to blaze away day and night. The DOT’s excuse: “checking for burnt out lights.” This hardly takes place on weekends. Not only  does this waste energy but contributes to early burn-out of light filaments due to the daytime ambient temperature.

DOT continues to maintain its mission as Florida’s most inept, wasteful and irresponsible department.

There can be no explanation that will justify passage of this bill unless it

Other than our mutual friend Jim Copeland who obviously has a job to do, I
know of not a single person who can explain why this bill should pass.   If
you have one, I would enjoy hearing it. This bill is simply a bill to add
dollars to the bottom line of phone companies.  If the bill demanded they
start to provide service to customers again, the trade off might be
understandable. This is not the case, however. Because this bill does damage

3rd-Graders Get Their Share Of Shock, Awe

STEVE OTTO 
Published: Apr 17, 2003 

The thing about a plan is that you ought to have one. 
Jeb Bush would like to be known as the education governor. He wants to raise standards and eliminate social promotion. He wants to get rid of bad schools and let students go where they can get a quality education. 
That's what he says and has been saying for a long time. Maybe it's true. It all sounds good. I don't know anyone who likes rampant social promotion or lower standards. Everyone I know is for some kind of accountability. 
For years the governor has delivered his message in photo-op moments, showing up for an hour at some local school for the picture that will run the next morning in Mother Trib or some other paper. 
The trouble is, for all his show- and-tell presentations, things aren't getting better. 
At last check, Florida's education system was continuing its steady slide, from ignoring the needs of universities on down to the chaos of student testing and the possibility of thousands of third-graders failing. 
Bush was at it again this week, this time at Cahoon Elementary in Tampa. His message this time was that families should appreciate politicians who ``actually care their children are learning.'' 
That's a good one to anyone who has been following the machinations in Tallahassee, where politicians are demonstrating daily that about the only thing they care about is protecting their hides. 
Can You Putt? 
As program after program designed to help the hungry and the poor goes down the tubes, local special interest projects somehow manage to survive. 
So far, the proposed Edison Community College golf building is still kicking, at $700,000, as is a softball training center in Altamonte Springs for $100,000. 
Oh, and there also is the $10 million proposed for a light rail line from Orlando's airport to Disney World, which might be one more reason the proposed high-speed rail through Tampa won't bother stopping at Tampa International. 
On Monday, Bush flew in to prop up what could be a public relations disaster in a few weeks when the results of this year's Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test roll in and potentially tens of thousands of third-graders who failed are told they will be held back. 
The governor said that might be all right. Holding students back a year can be a good thing, he told reporters. He had little to say about special-needs students who might take the test until doomsday, but that's another issue. 
But Who Pays? 
In case some people don't think staying back for a year is a good thing, Bush said he wants summer camps set up with reading mentors. Education Secretary Jim Horne, who came along, said if kids do well in those programs, they might not be held back. 
What nobody seemed to say was exactly who would pay for all of this or where all those mentors would be found. 
Horne said local school districts would have to pay for the remediation. Unfortunately the state already asked the schools to spend that money on other programs, and the bottom line is there is little or no money left. 
That isn't the governor's problem. He is long gone, talking about his latest plan elsewhere in Florida. 
The problem is ours, just as it is our fault that the educational system is in the hands of budgeteers instead of educators and that the bottom line is not just money but where we are headed on the learning curve.

Subject: Update on shooting at La Petite Academy
 
12:10 p.m. Thursday
 
As previously reported to you, a shooting occurred this morning at La Petite Academy in the Merchants Walk Shopping Center in Bluewater, approximately three blocks from Bluewater Elementary School.
 
The victim has been identified and is the mother of a student at Valparaiso Elementary.  
 
Six students from our schools - three from Plew, two from Edge, and one from Bluewater - were on the La Petite bus which was in the parking lot of the Academy at the time of the shooting.  According to information provided to me, these students witnessed the shooting as the La Petite bus was pulling out from the Academy.  These are students who were using the before-school services of La Petite before being taken by the Academy's bus to our schools for the beginning of the school day.
 
The parents of these students have been contacted and have either picked up their children from school or have made other arrangements.  
 
We have offered facilities, services, counseling, and other support to La Petite Academy.  Our personnel are working with the families of the students who witnessed or may have witnessed the shooting.  Our psychologists will be at ValP Elementary tomorrow to counsel and support fellow students of the student whose mother was shot.
 
Dr. McEachern continues to be directly involved with the situation.
 
An editorial note, if I may:   This is a horrible tragedy - made more horrible still because children were nearby.  The mother who was shot is a personal friend of mine.  We have known each other for years.  This tragedy brings home sharply the reality that terrible, unthinkable things can happen even in our safe, homey, friendly community.  Children and parents look to us as guardians of safety and caretakers with common sense.  Remind yourself of the precautions and safeguards we should all take when we see any warning sign, any suggestion that there could be violence or danger.  The shots that rang out today in Bluewater were close enough to be heard at an elementary school a few blocks away and the horror that ensued was played out before the eyes of children who attend our schools.  This isn't just close to home.  This is tragedy in our face, on our watch.
 
Thank you for all you do to be observant, to take extra precautions, to use good common sense in our stewardship of children.
 
We'll keep you in touch as there are other developments to share.

State's crime rate in 2002 was the lowest in 30 years

BY ERIKA BOLSTAD
ebolstad@herald.com

TALLAHASSEE - Florida's crime rate last year was the lowest in 30 years, a feat state leaders attributed Wednesday to a decade's worth of tougher sentencing laws, more prison beds and the ending of early prison release programs.

''There's been a 180-degree turn in how we provide public safety for our citizens,'' said Tim Moore, commissioner of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.

Overall, the crime rate per 100,000 people in Florida dropped 3.3 percent from 2001 to 2002, according to FDLE statistics released Wednesday. The sheer number of crimes reported in the state also decreased 1.2 percent, a gradual slide that started in 1992.

Not only has Florida lost its status as the state with the highest crime rate, but Lt. Gov. Toni Jennings and Attorney General Charlie Crist quipped at a news conference that the days of the governor traveling to Miami wearing a bulletproof vest are long gone.

''This is not just coincidence, nor is it just a product of good luck,'' Jennings said. ``Gov. Bush's tough stance on violent crime has paid off.''

Although Jennings credited Bush and Republican legislators for the drop, the decline actually began when Democrats were in charge of the Legislature and the governor's office in 1992.

Locally, Miami-Dade County saw an overall decrease in the crime rate of 3.7 percent, but saw 14 more murders between 2001 and 2002 for a total of 204.

The crime rate in areas covered by the Miami-Dade Police Department decreased 5.6 percent. In Miami, the crime rate dropped 3.8 percent and Miami Beach saw a 7.4 percent decline. Hialeah saw a mild decrease of .3 percent.

COMMUNITY HELP

The Miami Police Department credits its efforts to enlist community help.

''We attribute it to primarily the cooperation between the police department and the community. People are coming to us and letting us know what's happening and helping us come up with solutions,'' Delrish Moss, spokesman for the Miami police, said.

Prevention efforts -- dedicating officers to stopping crime before it happens -- has made the difference in county-patrolled areas, said Juan DelCastillo, spokesman for the Miami-Dade police.

''We're not surprised,'' he said. ``We continue our efforts with enhanced patrols like our Robbery Intervention Detail and the tactical narcotics team.''

Broward County saw a 5.8 percent decrease in the crime rate, with the number of murders staying the same at 90.

While Moore and Jennings gave legislators credit for the decline in the crime rate, they failed to point out that in late 1980s and early 1990s the United States not only saw a recession, but many cities were rocked by the problems created by the crack cocaine epidemic.

NEW RULES

But 1999's tough ''10/20/Life'' law that calls for mandatory prison sentences for using a gun to commit a crime has had an impact, Moore said, and so have new rules that keep felons in jail for nearly their entire prison sentence. ''It works,'' Moore said.

Moore acknowledged there's still plenty of work for Florida law enforcement.

The number of murders in the state rose 4.5 percent from 867 in 2001 to 906 in 2002.

The state also saw a slight uptick in the number of violent crimes committed with gun. Also, domestic violence accounts for more than 26 percent of violent crimes; more than one-fifth of all murders started out as domestic violence incidents.

Herald staff writer Lisa Arthur contributed to this report.

Dear Governor: 


Upon reading the Orlando Sentinel article about Bud Nocera possibly becoming the CEO at Visit Florida, I thought I'd let you know my perspective, for what it's worth. 


After Austin Mott left Visit Florida, Bud emerged as a bonafide leader to the pleasant surprise of many industry professionals with whom I've spoken. As you know, we regularly work with almost everyone in the tourism industry. From everything I know, Bud is approachable, personable, very professional and maintains solid industry relations. He has overwhelming support from VF staffers and management which is good for morale. He's led the charge during difficult times with a steady hand. 


It goes without saying that Florida Monthly magazine and Florida Media Inc will support and work with whoever you choose. However, I think Bud Nocera would be the perfect choice to continue leading VF and wholeheartedly support him solely based on his person, leadership skills and performance. 


Hope you are well. As always, don't hesitate to yell if there is anything I can do to help you in any way. 


Best regards

Thank you so very much for taking the time out of you very busy schedule to participate in our recent League of Teachers Meeting.  We received numerous positive comments from the teachers in attendance about your session.  The teachers found you to be very warm, approachable, and concerned about issues that are close to their hearts.  In addition, many of the teachers commented about your dedication and commitment to education and the students of Florida.  Your session with our teachers was a huge success and we appreciate the efforts you made to be with our group.

Dear Jeb:
 
I think that the house and senate should leave the telephone situation at the present status, I do not see the benefit for Florida in changing.  More attention needs to be made about Worker's Comp and Health Insurance.   The rate increases are hurting small business.  Our rates went up over 50% from last year on both.  With WC we had to agree to 150% of state rate.  Few insurance companies are writing WC policies for the state, especially for construction companies.  Your letter to the editor in the Herald last week hit the points correctly.  The senate needs to get its act together, both King and De-Portilla are wrong.  I talked to Speaker Johnnie Byrd at a reception two weeks ago about.  He is a good man.           Thanks, Kurt H. Olson    305-805-6900.

State of Florida Division of Retirement 
Cedars Executive Center 
2639 N. Monroe St., Bldg. C         
Tallahassee, FL 32399-1560

Dear Director Sjostrom:

    In my opinion and in the opinion of many others, the Final Order by 
former director, A.J. McMullian 111, violates my right to purchase overseas 
teaching service at 6% of salaries earned and violates my right to a pension 
of 2% for the years of Florida teaching service as a member of the Florida 
Teachers’ Retirement System from 1952 until 1963. 
    I did claim and purchase seven years of prior Florida service, but the 
Division of Retirement did not grant 2% per year as prior Teachers’ 
Retirement System service, but only gave it a 1.68% per year as though the 
service was rendered as prior Florida Retirement System service rendered 
after 1970.  Doug Cherry has for years in retirement workshops across Florida 
shown on the overhead projector, said in his presentation, and given in 
written handouts prepared by the Division of Retirement that Florida Teaching 
Service as a member of the Florida Teachers’ Retirement System is given a 2% 
yearly calculation.
    I understand that you can not lobby for a bill to allow the pension that 
I was promised by the Florida Teachers’ Retirement System in 1959, contracted 
by Florida Statutes through 1969, and actually protected by the enactment of 
the Florida Retirement System Law in 1970.  However, please do not block or 
oppose legislation to rectify an unjust decision and allow my pension 
increase to what it should have been before Mr. McMullian’s disastrous Final 
Agency Order.  By the way, I believe I will be the only retired teacher 
covered under a proposed amendment to Ch. 121 of the Florida Statutes.
        Sincerely yours,      Volusia County teacher 1985-1997 (FRS)

Palm Beach and Volusia Legislators:

    Please have the following inserted in  Florida Statute Chapter 121 in 
2002-3:     “”For all former members of the Teachers’ Retirement System, who 
lost membership because contributions were withdrawn or because Florida 
teaching was not resumed for five or more years before 1970 and who returned 
to teaching as a compulsory member of the Florida Retirement System, the cost 
for purchasing TRS out-of-state or federal service will be determined by 6% 
of salaries earned for the years of service at the time membership ceased.  
All rights and benefits under the Teachers’ Retirement System will be 
restored and pension will be calculated at 2% for each year of service. This 
right and benefit are retroactive to date of retirement and before the first 
retirement check was issued and cashed.  An application for such teaching 
service must be applied for to the Division of Retirement after June 1, 2003 
and adjusted payment will begin on July 31, 2003.”  
    In 1997, when Robert C. Heath retired from 22 years of teaching in Palm 
Beach and Volusia Counties, Mr. A.J. McMullian III denied ten years of full 
retirement credit, because of a Florida Retirement System enacted in 1970.  
McMullian, in a contrived informal hearing at the Division of Retirement 
Offices, refused teaching credit for teaching in Heidelberg American High 
School, which the Teachers’ Retirement System grants, and only allowed seven 
years of Palm Beach service at 1.68% instead of 2% per year, which is 
mandated under the Florida Teachers’ Retirement System.
Dr. Heath is appealing to the Florida Legislators and Gov. Bush to amend 
Florida Statutes, Chapter 121, to raise his short changed pension to the 
correct pension promised before and after 1970 and protected by Ch. 121 for 
Ch. 238 benefits.                   Respectfully yours,

---------- Forwarded Message ----------

I offer my sincere apologies to those I offended by actions, motives, or ethics that have been attached to me by members of the Redesign group.  As one provider representative of the group, it has oft been challenging to be heard above the heart-felt contributions of some of the very vocal members.  Nevertheless, I stated on day one, throughout the many sessions, and interjected strongly last Wednesday morning, those troubling concerns I have about Florida's financing of its Developmental Disabilities Program.  
First, there is not enough money in the system to adequately serve those currently in the system and on the waiting list.  This is truly a fact, already tested in the courts.  By comparison, Florida is below average among the other states.  Individuals, families, advocates and providers share a vision where Florida is better than average in how it supports people with developmental disabilities.  Do we dare dream to be "number one?"  Our Governor and Legislature have made significant strides to address this problem over the last four years, and deserve our continuing strong support for their efforts.  
Second, the reimbursement for supports and services provided by organizations whose "rates" were set well over a decade ago, particularly for residential and day services, have been and remain inexcusably unreasonable.  Organizations like Florida ARF have championed this issue as a top priority consistently year after year.  These low rates affect people served by all sizes of organizations, small and large, as well as independent contractors.  I will save the "red herring" for dinner tonight. 
Third, the method of using standard rates to achieve "equity" is an historic one used by government programs that usually achieves mediocrity at best.  At worst, as is the case in Florida or any under funded system, the method of standardization by compression to the mean (average) merely redistributes inadequate funds more evenly.  Thereby, all recipients of services can expect mediocre services at best.  The solution of course, is to provide adequate funds for the population served and bring the lowest rates up to those rates that are adequate.  To decrease and redistribute adequate rates will only achieve inadequacy for all.
The Mercer rate architecture does not claim to use the method of compression to the mean.  But, we still do not know what numbers will be used by policy makers to plug into the rate architecture.  We therefore do not know how compression to the unknown state-selected standard will affect people or the providers that serve them.  The proposition that, taking money from people served by providers that have "high" administrative costs will generate enough money to equalize the system is an interesting one.  But when have we seen how that is going to be accomplished?  As I understand the principles of business operations, larger organizations tend to have proportionately lower administrative costs and smaller organizations higher administrative costs - due to economies of scale.  If the reverse is true in Florida, then let us have the proof.       
Fourth, we need to know the impact of the new system before we can enthusiastically support it.  That is simply common sense.  I challenge any one of us to identify the adversely affected individuals, families, organizations, or independent contractors.  If we cannot identify them, we cannot describe the impact - good or bad.  
Fifth, the Legislature, as the body of our elected representatives, has a right to know this information as well; and not before they go home or after any potential damage may be done.  In case I have not been heard, I ask each meeting for this type of information, and am asking, again, now.
Finally, this event has awakened the passion and energy within us.  Let us focus it on supporting the Governor's funding level recommendations.  Let us focus it on continuing the good work of creating a new system, with appropriate caution for unintended bad results, that truly will work well for individual consumers, their families, and that supports a caring and quality service delivery system.

Jeb:  I heard that Jim Warford is moving to Tallahassee. I hope that you will consider Jim Yancey as his replacement. I have known Jim for over 30 years and can tell you that he would make an excellent School Superintendent. 
 
Jim ran in 1992? for this position and lost in a primary Republican runoff. The Yancey family is a very popular and respected family. His father was the golf pro at the Ocala Golf Course and his brothers are high school coach's and business leaders. His mother serves on the City of Ocala's Planning & Zoning Board. 
 
Jim Yancey is a leader who we can all be proud of. I spoke with him and he has expressed his interest in running for this position when it comes up in 2004. I have no doubt that with his leadership record and ability to draw votes from the entire community he will be elected.
 
Please consider Jim Yancey for the position of Marion County Superintendent of Schools.
 
 
Thanks,
Chuck

We always have more questions for you. While we appreciate the way you always make yourself available for the press, it's usually taken up by TV reporters wanting to know about SARS (sigh). Anyway, I was just wondering what your thoughts were about what your role is in the budget "crisis" (term used loosely) TODAY. Do you just sit back and wait for a deal? Do you apply subtlety? Do you send minions down to the House and threaten with vetoes? Do you wait for them to come to you and ask for help? Just looking for a little insight. Thanks again.

Bill plays down FCAT for disabled students

By Bill Cotterell
DEMOCRAT SENIOR WRITER

The Florida Senate sent Gov. Jeb Bush a bill Wednesday that will allow students with learning disabilities to get regular high school diplomas without passing statewide standardized reading and math tests.

State Reps. Loranne Ausley, D-Tallahassee, and Bev Kilmer, R-Quincy, sponsored the proposal (HB 1739) to provide alternate ways for disadvantaged students to get into college. The governor has said he supports the bill, which does not reduce standards of the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test.

Students with speech or language difficulties, hearing and vision handicaps, autism, emotional difficulties, brain injuries or disabilities such as dyslexia could be certified by an "individual education plan" team to get a waiver of the FCAT's graduation requirements. The education team - made up of teachers, guidance counselors and other experts - would assess the student's learning progress from class participation, homework and other examples of learning besides the FCAT.

"Currently, if they can't pass the FCAT, they get a certificate of attendance that is not going to get them into college," Kilmer said. "That's not fair to a smart kid who is really trying, but can't perform well on a standardized test."

The bill requires students to complete academic credits and other requirements for high school graduation and to take the FCAT in the 10th and 11th grades. It also removes the requirement that the students take life management skills classes in the ninth and 10th grades, requires the State Board of Education to adopt rules for test accommodation and requires counties to provide instruction for disabled students for year-by-year progression in school.

Sen. Stephen Wise, R-Jacksonville, was the Senate sponsor of the House-passed bill. He said it will "open doors and provide greater educational opportunities for Florida's disabled students."

In an unusual move, Wise got unanimous Senate consent to immediately certify the bill to the governor for signature. It usually takes several days, even more than a week, for the paperwork to be routed on routine bills.

"It has such important ramifications for seniors in high school that the governor will sign this so they can get their diplomas this year," Wise said.

The Coalition for Independent Living Options said last month that thousands of disabled students statewide are in danger of being held back or not receiving their diplomas this year because they can't pass the test.

Dear Governor -

It is with great sadness that I report an accidental death in Iraq of a

the Iraqi area of responsibility and involved a HUMVEE (modern day jeep).

I will provide you with family information and contact phone numbers after

Notification includes personal visit by a Casualty Assistance Officer and a

District of Florida


Dear Governor:
 
Hon. Mag. Judge Casey Rodgers is on the short list of nominees to fill the position of District Judge for the Northern District of Florida.  I am writing to ask your endorsement to your brother's offices in support of Casey.
 
My grounds for endorsement are simple.  I am the worst kind of lawyer: a plaintiff's personal injury and employee's lawyer.  Worse yet, I am Board Certified by the Florida Bar.  And, even worse than that, I am a die hard yellow-dog democrat.
 
You may think I am trying to sink Casey's appointment with such a lead-in, but it is the opposite, indeed. 
 
What I am leading up to is this: I am also a long-time member of the Professionalism Committee of the Florida Bar, and am a current member of the Supreme Court Commission on Professionalism.  Casey and I locked horns on many cases, and I always found her to be of the highest character, competence and commitment.  I have no doubt that she will continue in such professional manner as a District Judge, and I, for one, would rest easy knowing someone of her caliber has a life-time appointment to a position of such great responsibility.
 
I hope you will use your personal and gubernatorial influence to support her appointment, as well.
 
Sincerely yours,

Jeb, Now I am asking for help for me and I am deep trouble.   The insurance on my apartment house in Winter Park has been with Republic Western  Ins Co of Phoenix.  Six weeks ago I got a cancellation notice giving the reason that they no longer represented my agent.   I called them and asked if I got another agent, could I stay with them.   They said I could and gave me the name of Takersley in Winter Park.  I went to their office and signed the change of agent form on March 13, 2003, just as they requested.  They said they would send me the bill.  Last night when I got in from Tallahassee, I had still not received a bill.  First thing this morning (April 16, 2003) I went to Tankersley's office to pay the bill.  He had received nothing from IB Green, his agent he writes under.   He called Green  and they told him they did not write commercial insurance and had neglected to tell him.  My policy had lapsed the day before. I HAVE NO INSURANCE !!!!!!!!   I felt I had done everything correctly and had relied on what they had told me.    Now since I have no insurance, to write a new policy with any company my premium (and I may not even get a policy)  will go up $7,000.00 a year.  For someone who is living off of $878.00 a month, this is overwhelming.   I called Tom Gallagher, but haven;t heard back yet.  I also callled the Ins hotline to see if anything could be done to help and they said they would call the company but it would probably be two week or more before they could get to it.(case no  S 0203 0005 0102)  They said I should call market research to get names of ins companies that I might get.  After staying on hold for 45 minutes, they gave me 7 names and I have called all of them and they do not cover apartment building, large or small.  THIS MARKET ASSITANCE PROGRAM DOESNT WORK.  I asked for the names of insurance companies that wrote in the State of Florida  and they said they didn;t have that information.  That is important information to have because I am wasting my time calling agent after agent to see who writes when in fact if you had the name of the ins companies that wrote it , I could call them and get an agents name from them.   This is a terrible situation.  Please help.  Maggie Rogers, 407 599 0260

Dear Governor Bush,

I am writing to you as the program administrator for the Florida League of Teachers.  Your presentation and Q & A at the recent League meeting was greatly appreciated by the League members.  They were inspired by your passion for education.  Hearing firsthand how strongly you support state education goals means a great deal to these teachers whose role is to educate and inspire other teachers while also serving in the "trenches" with their own students.  Having our Governor take the time to meet personally with the League helped them to understand - and internalize - the value you place on good teachers.  You set the stage for a very successful conference and you gained ambassadors for your initiatives.  Thank you very much!

Dear Jeb,  Just wanted to take a minute of your busy schedule to request that you consider yourself if possible or the lieutenant governor to make an appearance at one of our dealership locations in Melbourne or Orlando to help kick off National Safe Boating Week here in Florida.  
 
We plan heavy TV, Radio and Newspaper advertising which incorporates promoting National Safe Boating Week including giving away free life jackets at our dealerships.  As you know the boating industry is a large part of Florida's economy in many ways including Jobs, Tourism, and Tax revenue for our State.  Your brother, The President, has previously endorsed Boating Safety Week at the national level and we think it would be a great opportunity for you to make a public appearance that promotes one of Florida's greatest assets...getting out on our vast array of beautiful waterways and doing so safely.  
 
Boating Safety Week also coincides with our busiest season in serving Florida's Boaters.  Any help you can give our industry by raising awareness of the wonderful recreational opportunities related to boating in Florida will directly help all of us with Jobs in the Industry.  Thanks for your time and consideration.  I have included this link  http://www.safeboatingcouncil..org/ <http://www.safeboatingcouncil.org/>  which details the efforts being made to promote this event.

Dear Governor:

I¹m not in personal contact with you or your staff very much but I keep a keen eye on the success of your education reform policies.  During the last decade, as I have been heading StandardsWork, Inc, a non-profit education consultancy, no other state has been as bold in applying all the tools available to the challenge of reforming schools as Florida has.  During this time, I have worked side by side with Jeanne Allen of the Center for Education Reform and two years ago I joined her Board.  
It is in CER¹s behalf that I write to you today.

CER will celebrate its Tenth Anniversary at a dinner Gala on October 29, 2003.  You have been invited to be the HeadlinerŠ representing the "BEST OF" the decade of reform. You and Florida will be used as a role model for the movementŠ which is essential if we are to sustain recent gains and fight off increasing opposition to choice and to holding the line on standards and accountability.

I know that it is difficult for staff to "commit" to events in advance, but it really is important to us that we have just thatŠ a commitment that you will be present and will allow us to honor you and the benefits of bold leadership.

Thanks for giving this consideration.  
(I know that my Mother would also want me to send her  warmest regards.)

Dear Governor,
 
I know how busy you are, and I don't mean to bug you, but have you received the various citizens comments (about the UCF Master Plan) I sent you in the mail?  I also had some faxed to Ms. Castille;  I think she is trying to find out the status of DCA's discussions with UCF. I won't fax the comments to your office if you've already received the packet I sent.  I just really hope you have a chance to read them.
 
Thank you for all your time---I appreciate it.
 
Best,
 
Rebecca

just a quick note to let you know how frustrating the bureaucracy can be....as I have told you, I am opening a very specialized, one of a kind in the country SNF....an unfortunate typing error was made on the application to AHCA....it took 6 months to get it to the point of approval, only to have it knocked down and is now in a quagmire of tape and will possibly be held up for another two months....this is costing thousands of dollars a week and delaying care to very clinically compromised people....Sen. Graham sent out a call, searching for such a facility for a Florida constituent, but now we are yet again delayed in opening and cannot help.........surely there must be an easier route than weeks and months of tweaking over such an issue when the need is so great....if it takes this much haggling to meet the regulatory compliance....maybe the regs. are either hairsplitting or ridiculous....we are here with a beautiful 3.5M building and can't get past the CON, Chapt.408 I think...anyway....thanks for listening....this is a small reason why people think government is a living enity....it can put your life on hold.....
Hope you have a blessed and happy Easter!....I keep you in my prayers.......2R'S

Gov. Bush,
 
I thought of you at Speaker Byrd's media availability yesterday when I asked him how it was possible for a Fiscal Conservative to support so-called budget "turkeys." He surprised me by not addressing that question and it dawned on me that there may be quite a difference between walking the walk and talking the talk.
 
As a reporter, it's easy to assume someone is a Fiscal Conservative when they claim that distinction, especially when they're already a Conservative Republican. It's not as easy (particularly for me as a Capital Press Corps newbie) to work through the rhetoric to a real litmus test for distinguishing between vanilla Republicans and those who are true Fiscal Conservatives.
 
Anyway, a light went on for me during the turkey discussion.
 
On a completely different note, I've been assigned to prepare a magazine-style profile on you on a very short timeline. It looks like you don't do one-on-ones interviews, so I won't ask for private time directly. However, be advised that I will file a request with the press office as a matter of course with the expectation that it most likely will be rejected. 
 
I'll also be asking your press team for suggestions on areas where I should focus and people I might interview for the profile. I won't limit myself to those sources, but I will seek them out. 
 
I'd appreciate a reference from you to a book or briefing paper that provides insight into your particular brand of Conservative Republicanism. 
 
Obviously, I'm trying to figure out what makes you tick - like every other reporter. However, I'm not hampered by my own political agenda and I think that may allow me to provide my readers with a more accurate picture. Being a former business reporter gives me a leg up.
 
Right now, I see a person who is trying to rein in the power of the unions representing state workers and teachers. I suspect this may be partly due to the inflationary nature of their salary agenda, which routinely raises median pay standards by using them as a goal. I also suspect that engaging the unions may be a requirement for anyone seeking to make systemic change. However, I don't necessarily view this conflict along strictly political lines as it also unifies union membership.
 
I see you struggling mightily for quality economic development and being stymied by Florida's tourism and retiree-based economy and its tax structure. This dilemma brings to mind a story I wrote three years ago about Southwest Florida's congested roadgrid, in which I pointed out that you it's hard to sell high-brow home with low-brow roads. By the same token, it's hard to sell Florida to manufacturers and technology companies in the sense that getting them here is only part of the equation. They have to be happy afterward for word to spread.  
 
I'm told that you make recruitment calls to one company a day, but my site-selection friends also tell me that their fraternity still views Florida negatively because manufacturing interests have far less clout here than tourism, retiree and citrus interests. They point to what they claim is a poorly educated workforce and weak education system as deterrents. And they say your efforts in this regard are meritorious, but probably won't bear fruit for years and, even then, only if they're not reversed by your successor.  
 
I also see a true fiscal Conservative, who is trying to impose those values on a Legislature that talks that talk, but doesn't necessarily walk that walk.
 
Finally, I see a set of fiscal policies that sometimes resemble class-warfare. At the same time, I have a gut feeling that's not what you're really about.
 
These are just the preliminary perceptions of a first-year member of the Capital Press Corps, and by no means my only ones. They are a work in progress and I'm revising them all the time. I'd welcome any enlightenment you wish to provide and will try to provide a balanced, accurate and engaging profile. 
 
It won't be the definitive article on "Jeb" because I'm not in a position to write that story. It may be that no one is. 
 
Respectfully,
Victor Epstein

Hi Jeb,

I would like to speak with you about building a world-class museum and
education center somewhere in Florida. Not just a little corner-side
museum or gallery, but a large center to compete with the finest museums
and schools in the world, the Hermitage, the Metropolitan, the Louvre,
etc (we have the inventory AND unique education material to do so). I'd
like to say upfront that I'm NOT looking for charity or public funding.
What I'm in need of is your support.  

I don't know if you recall our past conversations, but my grandfather,
Gideon, has been a famous artist and Florida landmark for nearly 60
years. In that time, we've built up a huge collection of fine artwork,
historical an artistic knowledge unlike any other in the world. We would
like to create a large, profit-driven center to share the art and
knowledge with the global community.

This project will be unique and massive, but I'm positive that it can be
another great Florida attraction and generate a substantial amount of
revenue, both internally and for the community and state as a whole. To
make this happen, I need serious investors and contacts of people who
would have interest in seeing something like this come to fruition. I'm
hoping that you would have some interest in what I'm proposing, enough
to allow me to get into further detail with you.

If you'd like to talk about this in more detail, please let me know.


Kind regards,
Rick Gideon Jr

Would you be able to spend about 15 minutes with about 200 middle school
students from RAA on Thursday, May 15, 2003?

citizenship and applaud this group of students for the good citizenship
they have displayed during the school year.  This is our end of the year
program for "Gold Card Students."  The program is planned and implemented 
by parent volunteers.  

We plan to leave RAA at 10 a.m., arrive at the capitol around 10:15 and
would like you to address our group in the Rotunda around 10:30. The
students would be delighted if you could do this, not to mention your
"little friend."  One day I'll tell you the story of how I became your
"little friend."  I wear the title with pride!    Anyway, please see if
you can fit this into your very busy schedule.  

It would really help with our planning if we could confirm as soon as

	How about a fee for every pleading filed with the court?  Even if it's

Opinion
Caps not answer on malpractice

Please consider this an open letter to all physicians and citizens of Florida regarding medical malpractice insurance reform. Florida medical professionals are truly facing a crisis, and I agree, they are victims of outrageous insurance rate increases over the years. Many physicians are not purchasing coverage, and by doing so, they are placing themselves and their families in financial jeopardy. Many have opted to leave the state, moving their expertise to more lucrative ground. I am repeatedly saddened by the personal accounts of doctors who have watched their livelihoods deteriorate to the point that they now consider leaving the profession they have trained for, worked at and love. I am committed to bringing them needed relief.

Also to my dismay, I have witnessed a number of physicians succumbing to the prospect of the "easy fix" to this problem. These trained professionals have bought into the idea, "Give us a $250,000 cap on damages and all of our problems will go away." Even more desperate is the certainty in which they claim, "We will have carriers beating down the doors to write malpractice insurance in the state of Florida." This mantra has been fed to Florida's doctors by the false prophets of the insurance industry and by the doctors' own associations. When asked directly if insurance companies will lower their rates if such measures were to be implemented, those companies have flat out said, "No."

The Florida Senate has been criticized for not supporting the $250,000 cap. While hundreds of doctors have voiced their support for the caps, numerous senior citizens have begged their elected officials not to impose them. Members of the Legislature are inundated with articles from the Wall Street Journal, USA Today, Business Week and a whole host of newspaper editorials suggesting that caps are not the answer. We must look beyond caps, to a more encompassing solution, as the entire insurance industry is broken. If caps are considered the Holy Grail of insurance reform, then wouldn't this measure alone succeed in addressing the myriad of problems rampant throughout the entire insurance industry? Notice caps are not an issue in workers' compensation, wind storm insurance, property and casualty insurance and just about any other insurance product sold in the state, most of which also require reform measures.

Many have testified that other states are faring better, touting success in California and Indiana. Eager to be enlightened, I requested a copy of Indiana's program, including the legal statutes. After thorough review, I found firm caps that exceeded $250,000. I read about a state-funded insurance program, which by most testimonials, is regarded as one of the best in the nation.

In speaking with the Indiana Medical Society, I have discovered that if Florida adopted the identical legislation, Indiana's model legislation, the two insurance companies writing in Indiana would not come to our state and write policies for the same rates. One of the two remaining carriers in Indiana, Pro Assurance Co., currently writes policies in Florida.

Upon contacting Pro-Assurance Co., I was referred to a representative who was knowledgeable about the Florida market. I asked again, "If Florida adopted Indiana's program, would they be willing to provide coverage for our doctors at the same rates charged in Indiana?" The answer was an unequivocal no. The answer is not caps. The answer is comprehensive reform.

On April 2, I had a meeting with the leadership of the Florida Medical Association, the chief lobbyist of the FMA and others. I repeatedly explained I was unwilling to support insurance reforms that would do nothing but help insurance companies line their pockets. Those insurance companies refuse to institute lower rates for our doctors but desperately desire the profits associated with the caps. I further clarified that if the FMA would take the time to find: A) an existing state law in any state that serves the needs of doctors, protects the most vulnerable, disciplines bad doctors and provides better medical services to citizens, and B) Gives our medical professionals affordable medical malpractice insurance that the Senate would support it.

I clarified that we do not, however, believe caps provide the citizens of this state or our doctors the reprieve that is being promised. We are not willing to sell out either party. The Senate will not bow down to pressure from any special-interest group. We remain committed to finding a product that will solve the multifaceted problems of medical malpractice and will not just implement a feel-good measure that only benefits the insurance industry.

The medical profession in Florida has repeatedly attacked the Senate, claiming that we are not being responsive to their needs. Doctors, why would you want to put a Band-Aid on a wound when you need to perform major surgery? I encourage Florida's doctors to begin making calls to their medical associations demanding total tort reform. Demand that your medical associations cut ties to insurance companies and become part of the solution. One of the largest contributors to the FMA is the medical malpractice insurance industry. I encourage the citizens of Florida to look carefully at the Senate proposals aiming to solve the medical malpractice crisis. We are committed to immediately reducing insurance rates for our doctors, protecting Florida's emergency room and trauma centers, and making sure quality health care remains affordable and available in Florida.

Doctors, order your associations to spend their time and your money looking for compatible laws working in other states; laws that practicing doctors deem acceptable. Tell your associations to look at changing the laws regarding self-insurance. Encourage them to research the added costs of managed care, pharmaceutical companies and territorial fights in areas of scope of practice.

In other words, before you throw stones at the Senate, remember the words, "Physician, heal thyself."

Governor:
 
I understand, and thank you.  It is my impression that we are in a bad spot...the Conceptual Plan passed by the Governing Board had several flaws:
 
1) It was written without broad stakeholder input, especially the final draft;
2) It was modified by the Governing Board to embrace 15ppb, hardly an objective scientific body, despite the excellent attirbutes of the members;
3) It has never received peer review, and has not received public input (the public comment period has just now closed, I think).
 
To have this as the basis for anything, especially state legislation PRIOR to public input, puts Everglades restoration in a bad light.  David has told me you understand several flaws in the Plan, but I'm not sure if the above has reached your radar screen in a big way.  Dismissing the above, the retraction of Kadlec and Walker and other criticisms as minor or misinformed is inappropriate.
 
Also, people say that CERP and the EFA are complementary, but separate processes.  That's just plain not true: the EFA is part of the pre-condition for CERP, and is included in the GCSSF Conceptual Plan (for the Restudy), the comments on the Restudy itself (part of the consensus public record) and in CERP.  Our friends in the industry know all of this and publicly agreed to it in various documents.  
 
Documentation of the assumption of compliance with the EFA in the Restudy (CERP) can be found in D-E.3.1.2 page D-E-7:

"To meet water quality requirements of the Everglades Forever Act, structural discharges to the Everglades Protection Area for Restudy alternatives/scenarios are assumed to be at the default phosphorus concentration criterion in the EFA (10 ppb)."

and throughout appendix H (pages H-15-16, H-63, VIII-2, Attachment A page 9 or FFGC letter, etc). As you know, the original Sustainable South Florida Conceptual Plan was part of WRDA 1996 and said the same thing.  Note that although most of the environmental community did not endorse the EFA, Audubon and others on the GCSSF and CERP swallowed hard and signed off on this. Now we want everyone to live up to it, or work together to find a consensus scientific solution...not a political end-run. 

My point is that whoever is briefing you (and David?) that the EFA and Everglades Restoration/CERP are not linked has either not read the CERP documents, or has been briefed by people who have not read the documents, or is ignoring the above (at considerable peril, clearly), or believes that "spin" is more important than substance.  Please deal with them appropriately, as they are expending your political capital on this at an alarming rate.

People have accused Audubon of following funding over "what's right."  Read over the above and tell me, objectively, what's right.
 
People have told you the environmental community will sue in 2006: are the actions of the Governing Board, and this bill (in Judge Hoeveler's court alone) not more likely to lead to legal action?
 
People have said that the environmental community backs away from negotiations and promises: All I am asking is that you make us all stand firm by our promises of 1988, 1992, 1994, 1996, 2000, etc..  Use that, and the flawed process of the recent SFWMD Conceptual Plan, as leverage to open an objective, open public process: use an extended public comment period on the Conceptual Plan as a starting point.  We'll get it done and completed, with the feds involved, and signed off on by the Water Resources Advisory Commission, the Working Group and the Task Force...then the legislation part will be easy.  You did this in 1999 on Everglades legislation...let's do it again, with everyone on-board.
 
Having weighed all options, I see only an open public pathway as safe from lawsuits, political rancor, and internecine warfare between the true partners in CERP (state and feds, with private sector supporting).  Audubon staff is willing in Florida and DC (and to the highest levels of our institution), other members of my community are willing, the feds are willing...Sure, there will be bumps and lumps, as there always have been, but defining the process and bringing people together is leadership.  What the legislature is currently doing, and what the Conceptual Plan embodies, what the industry is doing, and (mostly in reaction) what others are doing is not.  Save us all from ourselves.
 
Don't know what else to say.  We'll work in any public forum you choose, and will being others to the table, if we can remove this from its current reliance on a flawed bill that is based on a flawed process resultant from a flawed document.  
 
Just my thoughts for the day.
 
Stuart

Joint Statement from Congressmen Shaw and Goss on Meeting with Secretary Struhs

Washington, D.C. - Today we met with Secretary David Struhs to further the dialog between the state and their federal partners on a recent Everglades bill being considered in the Florida Legislature.  We were pleased to hear that the Governor's office remains committed to holding the line on standards and time lines set for water quality by 2006.  

We remain steadfast, however, in our determination that any changes being considered to any Everglades related legislation must be made with full transparency.  It is therefore our continued recommendation that the Florida Legislature table this flawed bill at this time.  We cannot over emphasize the fact that to do otherwise would seriously jeopardize the federal dollars that are ultimately needed to ensure our mutual goal - the restoration of the Florida Everglades.

 While consensus is certainly possible, it can only be reached when both partners work together towards that goal without the influence of special interests.  We welcome all stakeholders to the table to present their case in the months to come.

 

                                                                        # # #

Governor:

On a lighter note: I thought you would be interested in this polling. Polls are polls but it is interesting and Gallup is pretty neutral. Note it was just released this week. The two answers that really struck me were that 57% felt the quality of the environment was getting worse, and that 60% felt that conservation of energy was the best way to deal with shortages, as opposed to increasing energy/oil production (29%).  A 2:1 margin for energy conservation!  That would be a great platform, you know...

Cheers, 

Stuart

Jeb:

Howard Tescher, who happens to be my brother in law, is on the short list of names sent up to you as a nominee for a Circuit Court seat in Broward. 

Howard is an extremely well respected attorney and would make an excellent judge, one who would apply the law - not create it.  

Howard understands the roles of the respective branches of government and especially the limited and crucial obligations of the judiciary. He has established an outstanding record as an attorney, and as a supporter of your work; I have known him now for over 25 years, long enough to know that he will produce solid results - not surprises - and that he will serve the State at all times with honor.  

It is for those reasons that I am most comfortable in recommending Howard to you for appointment.  Howard will be in Tallahassee next week for interviews with your staff.

Subject:	Healthcare Rights

Dear Charlene:

I always enjoy reading your editorials.  Your comments on "Healthcare
Rights" in the March issueof Healthcare Informatics are right on as far as
the reasons for concern, if Medicare is privatized.

There is a ton of information available (eg, www.pnhp.org) about the
unnecessary costs of our existing healthcare system.  Compared to all
other industrialized countries, our healthcare cost of almost 15% far
exceeds them (average 10%).  Where does this additional cost burden come
from?  Primarily it is the cost of healthcare insurance, which is so
internecine, bureaucratic and unfair, we have actually lost sight of it.

Surely there are enough objective financial, informatics, and economist
professionals to lay a sound cost/benefit argument before the American
public, sufficient to make the shift to a single-payer universal
healthcare program (NOT government-run, rationed care).

There is abundant evidence that an effective universal healthcare program
would provide ALL Americans with far BETTER healthcare service for far
LESS cost.  It is about time to create the healthcare system Americans
have a right to expect.

Best regards/ George Swan/ Tampa, Florida

Sir, 
General Burnett asked that I forward this information to you on the death
and serious injury of two of our soldiers. As soon as DOD releases this
information, I will alert Brandi so that she can place the information on
your call list.  Very respectfully, Roy Clark



Corporal John Travis Rivero, a member of the Florida National Guard, died as
a result of a vehicle accident in western Iraq.  The accident occurred at
4:45 PM local time (Iraq) on April 17, 2003.  Four soldiers were in an
armored Humvee out side of H1 Airfield when the accident occurred.  Two of
the soldiers received minor injuries and have returned to duty.  A third
soldier, Sergeant Robert K. Garrison, suffered serious head injuries and has
been evacuated to an Army hospital in Rota, Spain.  Sergeant Garrison's
condition was listed as serious but we have reports he is improved this
morning.  Sergeant Garrison's next of kin is his father, with a New York
address.  We do not have verification that Sergeant Garrison's father has
been notified of his injuries.  We expect notification and verification
early this afternoon.  The body of Corporal Rivero is in route back to the
United States.

All of the involved soldiers are members of Delta Company, 2nd Battalion,
124th Infantry located in Eustis, Florida.  They were assigned to Charlie
Company, 2nd Battalion, 124th Infantry and deployed to the Iraqi Theater
after mobilization in December.  

Corporal Rivero was single and is survived by his mother, Mrs. Patricia
Gardham, Ontario
Canada. Mrs. Gardham was notified of her son's death last evening and is in
route to Gainesville,
Florida to be with the grandmother and sister of Corporal Rivero.  The
grandmother in Mrs. Nell 
McIntrye, 4125, NW 44th Drive, Gainesville, Florida 32609.  The sister is
Ms. Maria Terese 
Strickland, 3004 NE 142 Lane, Gainesville, Florida 32609.  Both grandmother
and sister were 
officially notified at 0945 hours this morning by the Casualty Assistance
Command from Fort 
Stewart.  We have a chaplain, a public affairs officer and a casualty
assistance officer  in route to 
Gainesville.  They should arrive before 1400 hours this afternoon.  Listed
telephone number for 
the sister is 352-485 2224 and the grandmother is 352-338 0076.  We have not
verified those 
numbers.

Corporal Rivero was 23 years old and listed no religious preference or name
or address for his father.  He designated his sister as his beneficiary.

Importance:	High

Office of Insurance Regulation
 
 
Activities Report 
 
 
Weeks of April 14 – April 18, 2003
 
Rule Hearings:
 
Rule 4-149.0025, Part III was noticed for consideration by the Financial Services Commission for May 13, 2003 in the Cabinet Meeting Room at 9:00 a.m.  This rule is for definitions of the Small Group Employer Health Care Access to implement legislative changes and move the definition section.  Also, Rule 4-149.003, .021; 4-156.011; 4-191.051; and 4-203.042 will be addressed regarding the Electronic Filing Rules.  This will be to implement the mandatory electronic filing of rate and form filings.
 
A Rule Hearing regarding Rule 4-154.112 and Rule 4-163.0045 is scheduled for May 14, 2003 at 9:00 a.m. in Room 116 of the Larson Building.  Rule 4-154.112 is regarding Guaranteed Availability of Individual Health Coverage to Eligible Individuals to make mandatory electronic filing of insurance form filings.  Rule 4-163.0045 is regarding Filings Requirements.
 
A Rule Hearing regarding Rule 4-154.525 is scheduled for May 14, 2003 at 10:00 a.m. in Room 116 of the Larson Building.  This rule is the Standard and Basic Benefit Plans to implement the plans pursuant to Section 62.6699(12), Florida Statutes.
 
Rule Development:
 
Amendments to Rule 4-189.003(4) were approved on March 15, 2003 regarding Workers’ Compensation; Application and Audit Procedures.  The amendments update Rule 4-189.003 due to changes required by SB 108.  SB 108 requires that the application insurers use be changed by including a sworn statement by the agent attesting that the agent explained to the employer or officer the classification codes that are used for the premium calculations, that the audit procedures insurers use be changed by mandating that at the completion of an audit, the employer or officer of the corporation and the auditor must print and sign their names on the audit document and attach proof of identification to the audit document.  
 
Rule 4-154, Part III was approved on March 15, 2003 regarding Health Reserves.  This is to update Health Reserves to be consistent with new NAIC standards.  This involves minimum reserve standards for individual group health insurance contracts.
 
Rule 4-189.055 was approved on March 15, 2003 regarding Records and Reports of Information by Workers’ Compensation Insurers.  This rule is required by HB 1803 (2001) to implement reporting and recording duties of workers’ compensation insurers.
 
An amendment to Rule 4-193.065(1)(m) was approved on March 15, 2003 regarding Continuing Care Contracts; Forms Incorporated by Reference.  This amendment adopts and incorporates updated form DI4-477, “Minimum Liquid Reserve Calculation”.
 
Rule 4-154, Parts V and VI were approved on March 15, 2003.  These rules were originally drafted to incorporate federal standards which governed group health and group health maintenance organization contracts.  Office staff has determined that it is unnecessary to adopt the federal HIPPA standards by rule as it would be redundant.  Further, Rule Chapter 4-149 adequately governs numerous issues which were proposed in these rules.
 
Emerging Issues:
 
On April 14, 2003, Judge Francis of the Circuit Court in Leon County, Florida, entered an Order directing the final discharge of Florida’s Ancillary Receivership of Reliance Insurance Company.  Reliance was placed in Ancillary Receivership in Florida for the purposed of liquidation on October 24, 2001.  The April 14, 2003 Order approved the Ancillary Receiver’s administration of these ancillary proceedings.  Based upon a prior agreement by the Pennsylvania Domiciliary Receiver of Reliance and Florida’s three (3) insurance guaranty associations, the April 14th Order also directed the Ancillary Receiver to make an early access distribution from the ancillary receivership assets to the three (3) Florida guarantee associations.  The distributions to the associations, totaling $4,820,659.47, was based on the percentage of Reliance claims exposure of each of the three Florida guarantee associations:  The Florida Insurance Guaranty Association (38%), The Florida Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association (4%), and The Florida Workers’ Compensation Insurance Guaranty Association (58%).  The final discharge of the Florida Ancillary Receiver’s responsibilities in the Ancillary Receivership is effective as of 11:59 p.m. on April 30, 2003.

The "All American Success Stories" showcase the progress and accomplishments of the students, teachers and educational programs throughout the state. Student nominees are judged based on the obstacles overcome as they pursued their education and the contributions to society they made since participating in an adult, career or technical program. The success stories of the winners are attached.

Approximately 160 nominations were submitted by Florida school districts for inclusion into the award bank of students who were deemed "program successes." Of the 160 nominations, 27 regional winners were chosen from various program categories. The nine state winners were then chosen from among the 27 regional winners. The overall winner, Conrad L. Boger of Valencia Community College, received a check in the amount of $15,000 for his program. Each of the other winners received a certificate honoring them as a participant in the All American Success Stories showcase. Winners also received a trophy and an all-expense-paid trip to Tallahassee to attend the awards ceremony. A check in the amount of $10,000 was awarded to their respective programs on their behalf.

Region I 


Dana Berry
Adult Education
Santa Rosa Adult School
Santa Rosa County

Dana Berry truly exemplifies the "All American Success Story" in adult education. Dana had quit school after her junior year. She and her military husband traveled the next few years and had four children, including a set of twins. In Milton, Florida, she found herself abandoned by her husband, and she was without transportation and financial support. Dana eventually remarried and enrolled at Santa Rosa Adult School (SRAS) and received her diploma in half the expected time. 

Dana never dreamed of having the opportunity to go to college due to personal adversity and financial burdens. However, because of her perseverance and outstanding grades, SRAS offered her a two-year scholarship to Pensacola Junior College (PJC) where she completed her Associate's Degree. Although she thirsted for more, Dana did not expect to further her education. When PJC called to offer her an additional two-year scholarship to the University of West Florida (UWF), she anxiously accepted. Dana completed her Bachelor's Degree in English Education while helping support the family by waiting tables and cleaning houses. 

Once graduated, she sought employment with SRAS. Unfortunately, there were no openings, but that did not discourage Dana. Instead, she volunteered to teach at SRAS--one of her most valued experiences. That year she was awarded Volunteer of the Year and continued to substitute teach and seek full-time employment at SRAS. Finally, Dana's former SRAS teacher left her position, which opened the door for Dana to teach...MATH! Admittedly, Dana was forced to teach herself many math skills along the way. Her efforts paid off when she moved into a position teaching English at SRAS six years ago where she continues to develop more innovative courses, such as Journalism and Web Design. Additionally, Dana has for several years sponsored the SGA, and she created a school newspaper, a yearbook and the school web site. The students admire, respect, and thoroughly enjoy "Mrs. Berry" and seek to enroll in her classes. 

In her spare time, Dana sits on the Board of Directors for the American Cancer Society's Relay for Life for Santa Rosa County and serves as co-chair for the SRAS Relay for Life team. She is also Associate Pastor at Victory Life Church. Dana is an inspiration to students, friends, co-workers, and administration with her passion for teaching, her kindness, and her steadfast enthusiasm for life. Dana says she may be back in that same classroom, but this time she is giving back the same help and support she herself received from SRAS all those years ago.

Region II

Lou Ann Austin
Patient Care Technician/Technical Education
Bradford-Union Vo-Tech
Bradford County

Lou Ann Austin is an example of an American success story. She entered the Bradford-Union Area Vocational-Technical Center in 1997. She was determined to get off public assistance and get her life together. She faced some challenges in the process of going through a divorce and trying to provide a living for three little girls. 

She began by enrolling in adult education to bring up her academic scores for entrance into the Health class at the Vocational Center. She managed to bring her scores up in just three months and enrolled in the Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) classes. She was working as a cashier at Food Lion and used an income tax refund to pay her fees. She continues to better herself through education, enrolling in Phlebotomy and Electrocardiogram (EKG) classes. She managed to pay for all of these classes on her own. 

Lou Ann has been employed at "Stella's Place" for two years. It is a group home where she assists with training disabled ladies to successfully function on their own. The residents she serves are permanent residents funded by the Bradford Association of Retarded Citizens (ARC). 

Lou Ann has increased her hourly wage from $6.00 to $9.02. She continues to support her children without any public assistance or spousal support. 

Lou Ann has been a volunteer in the school system and is constantly involved in community activities with her clients. She is a perfect example of determination, enthusiasm, and great devotion. She was able to make the best of where she was and strove to get where she wanted.

Region III

Conrad L. Boger
Radiography/Technical Education
Valencia Community College
Orange County

At age 30, after having been in the workforce with only a high school education working for slightly above the minimum wage, Conrad began his trek toward a better life. He applied and was accepted to Valencia Community College Radiography program, a decision inspired by a need to provide a better life for his family. He moved his wife and three-year-old child from their home 35 miles away to within one mile of Orlando Regional Medical Center where Valencia Community College (VCC) provided the classes. By moving near the school, he was able to lower monthly expenses. He sold his car to reduce car maintenance, fuel, and insurance expenses and purchased a bicycle to travel to and from school. To continue to provide support to his family as he attended classes, he obtained employment as a clerical support person in the Radiology Department of Orlando Regional Medical Center. 

The Radiography Program required attendance five days per week and nearly eight hours per day, leaving only nights and weekends for his studying and employment. Throughout his two-year pursuit of an A.S. degree, he worked 12 hours per day on Saturdays and Sundays and four hours per evening, two to three evenings per week. 

After two very successful years attending VCC, Conrad graduated with the A.S. degree in Radiology and was presented the Scholastic Achievement Award for achieving the highest grade point average in his graduating radiography class. After having been offered several opportunities for employment, Conrad chose to begin his career with Orlando Regional Healthcare. In the next few years, Conrad was promoted to Lead Portable Technologist, became a Computed Tomography (CT) Technologist and later was the first technologist cross-trained into the field of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at the hospital. Conrad applied for a promotion and was selected for a supervisor level position at Orlando Regional St. Cloud Hospital, then moved on to Manager of the radiology department where he is still employed.

His journey from radiology support staff to Radiology Department Manager took Conrad little more than six years after graduation. He has now been with Orlando Regional Healthcare for more than 12 years. Conrad is a member of the Valencia Community College Advisory Board for Radiography and Sonography, participates in OASIS Community Education Programs, and plays an active role with Junior Achievement for the local schools. He is an advocate for the continuation of all of the adult education programs by allowing students to do their clinical training in the department that he manages. This is an All-American Success Story. No one can deny that adult education is at the core of this good fortune and wonderful career of Conrad L. Boger.

Theresa Alcantar
Electricity Apprenticeship/JATC/Technical Education
Mid Florida Tech
Orange County

Theresa Alcantar was born in Michoacan, Mexico in 1968. Her parents immigrated to the United States with their 12 children when Theresa was 14 years old. She had already dropped out of school in the eighth grade for financial reasons.

Unable to speak English, she worked as a farm laborer earning just enough to pay rent on a small room and buy food. By the age of 17, Theresa found work in the fast food industry finally making minimum wage. Soon after that she started taking English classes and she passed the GED exam and earned her high school diploma. Afterwards, Theresa found work as a hotel housekeeper and got married. 

By the age of 21, Theresa was a divorced single parent struggling to survive. She was forced to work 70 to 80 hours a week at several jobs to support her baby. Then she learned about the Central Florida Joint Apprenticeship Training Council through Mid-Florida Tech. By 1996, Theresa started making $6.20 per hour, more than she had ever made in her life. 

After a five-year apprenticeship, Theresa and her 12-year-old daughter bought a home and no longer have to worry about their next meal. Theresa Alcantar is currently a foreman for Buena Vista Construction Company at Walt Disney World.


Registoire "Reggie" Gedeus
Law Enforcement Academy/Adult Education
Indian River Community College
St. Lucie County

Through his dedicated public service as the first Haitian police officer in the Fort Pierce Police Department, Reggie Gedeus, 41 is making a major contribution to the community. Gedeus came to the United States in 1988 seeking a better life for himself and his family. Getting an education was a priority. He immediately improved his English skills through the Indian River Community College English as a Second Language program and soon began preparing for his GED high school diploma. Well known among the members of the Fort Pierce Haitian community, Gedeus assisted other ESL students and continues to encourage Haitians to participate in adult education at the community college.

"IRCC has been a great resource to me and the other members of the Haitian community. The College's services are very convenient for us." Gedeus said. "There is no doubt that the education I received at IRCC changed my life."

In 1992, he passed the GED exam earning his high school diploma and was employed by the St. Lucie County School District as a teacher's aide. Gedeus worked with Haitian children, helping Creole-speaking parents communicate with teachers and become familiar with the schools. He was also proud to become a U.S. citizen.

In 1998, the married father of two entered the IRCC Basic Law Enforcement Recruit Academy. Upon graduation, he was hired by the Fort Pierce Police Department with special responsibility for communicating with Creole speaking residents.

But Gedeus isn't finished with his education yet! While working full-time as a duty officer, he completed his Associate in Arts Degree at IRCC in 2002 and will start the bachelor's degree program in Criminal Justice at Florida Atlantic University this spring.


Region IV

Jonah Perkins
Criminal Justice Academy/Technical Education
Pinellas Park High School
Pinellas County

Jonah is a graduate of the Criminal Justice Career Academy at Pinellas Park High School in Pinellas Park, Florida, successfully completing three years of Criminal Justice Assisting and graduating high school with honors. Jonah served as the vice president of the Florida Law Honor Society, was an active member in VICA and served on the school district's multi-cultural advisory group, AWARE. Jonah selected the Criminal Justice Career Academy because of his interest in the law and because of the hands-on, applied academic philosophy of the academy.

At the end of this school year, Second Lieutenant Jonah A. Perkins will leave the Naval Academy at Annapolis, MD., with his commission and his diploma. Jonah will begin active service with the United States Marine Corps where he hopes to become an attorney with the Marine Judge Advocate General (JAG) Office.

Jonah best summarized the challenges in his life in an essay he did his senior year of high school. The following is excerpted from that essay:

"I have spent my life in poverty. I have seen a man shot dead in the street. One of my closest friends is in prison for murder. I have been threatened by my own cousin with a gun. I can remember at an early age having to get down on the kitchen floor while eating dinner with my mother and siblings to avoid getting shot by neighborhood gunfire. My mother was both mother and father as my father is deceased. I know what it is like to live in fear for my life and the lives of my family."

Further demonstrating his ability to overcome adversity and in evidence of his personal initiative and drive, Jonah personally sought out Congressman Bill Young to gain his support in a recommendation for an appointment to the Naval Academy. 

Jonah has devoted many volunteer hours to the local Teen Court Program; he held a position in the local chapter of the National Urban League and has served as a student intern with the St. Petersburg Police Department.

Melanie Peter
Practical Nursing/Technical Education
Traviss Technical Center
Polk County

Melanie Peter had her first encounter with Traviss Technical Center in 1992. At the time, Melanie, a 20-year-old, single mother of a toddler, lived and shared expenses with her mother. In her own words, Melanie states "This was the most difficult time of my life. I wanted desperately to attend school but had no income and no car." Thanks to a guidance counselor who helped her obtain financial aid, Melanie was able to enroll in the LPN Program at Traviss. There were still obstacles to overcome (such as finding a way to get her son to pre-school while car-pooling to school herself), but Melanie was able to overcome these obstacles and achieve her dream of becoming an LPN. She graduated from Traviss Technical Center in July 1983.

After graduation, Melanie began working at Lakeland Regional Medical Center. In August 1986, Melanie decided to return to school and enroll at Polk Community College to pursue her R.N. Degree in 1989. In 1995, Melanie returned to Traviss Technical Center but this time, in a different role. Melanie was hired as a Licensed Practical Nurse instructor in the Health Science Department. For the last seven years, Melanie has utilized her position to mentor others by sharing her own "success story" with incoming and often times "underserved students."

Melanie has overcome tremendous obstacles to achieve her dreams. However, this success story is far from over. Serving as an LPN instructor at Traviss, Melanie again returned to college. In 1998, Melanie graduated with honors with a Master's Degree in Health Care Administration. Melanie could have chosen to further her career by pursuing other employment. But the heart of Melanie Peter and her love and appreciation for Traviss Technical Center has kept her close to her roots. In July 2002, after 20 years in the medical profession, Melanie Peter came "full circle." Melanie Peter, the former student, was appointed the new Director of the Health Science Department at Traviss Technical Center.

In addition to demonstrating the ability to overcome adversity, Melanie's contribution to her community in the areas of health and education are significant. She has demonstrated her compassion for others by organizing a community holiday program for hospitalized pediatric patients. Melanie is also a peer teacher and uses her new position to serve as an advocate and guest speaker in support of Vocational Education. Melanie is passionate about expanding opportunities for the Health Science Program at Traviss Technical Center and states, "It gives me great pleasure and satisfaction to give back to a system that made me what I am."

Tonja Edwards
Cosmetology/Technical Education
Manatee Technical Institute
Manatee County

Tonja Edwards is a survivor and a winner. Not only is she a 2002 graduate of the Cosmetology program, she is also the 2002 National Silver Medalist in CPR/First Aid (Skills USA-VICA). 

This 42-year-old mother of three children did not achieve this success overnight. The father of her children left when her youngest was only two months old. One of her children has Crohn's disease. She had to go on welfare until she could get a job as a childcare worker. 

Tonja worked in childcare for 20 years, getting her Child Development Associate (CDA) credential along the way. Towards the end of those 20 years, her oldest graduated from high school and she started to have difficulty dealing with the children in her care. She had to go back on welfare through Jobs ETC. She began volunteering in the office, making copies and filing. She knew she needed to embark on a new career. 

With the help of the Displaced Homemakers Program on the Manatee Technical Institute (MTI) Campus, she enrolled in Cosmetology. Upon finishing the program, she took the licensing exam and passed. While she is waiting for her license to arrive in the mail, she is volunteering at several salons four hours every other day. One of the salons will hire her as soon as her license arrives. 

When Tonja Edwards got on the plane to fly to Kansas City and represent the state of Florida in the National Skills USA competition, it was the first time she had ever flown and the first time she had ever been out of Manatee County. She let out a shriek when the plane took off. And when she won second place in the nation, the MTI team let out a shriek-a shriek of joy for someone who was so humble, who had worked so hard and overcome so much.


Region V

Jose Garcia
Industrial Electronics/Technical Education
Hialeah Senior High School
Miami-Dade County

Jose Garcia graduated in the top 10 percent of his class at Hialeah Senior High School in 1980 in the Industrial Electronics Vocational program, under the leadership of Mr. Phil Goodman. Jose fell in love with the field of electronics and won a special scholarship in Industrial Electronics. The scholarship enabled Jose to embark on a journey into an exciting career in a high-wage technical field.

Jose was born in Cuba, where Jose's grandfather worked as the head of engineers for the Cuban National Power Company. Jose's father, an electrical engineer, decided to leave Cuba when Jose was only three years old. The family settled in Union City, New Jersey. Jose later relocated to Florida.

In spite of the odds against him, Jose attained the dream his father and mother had envisioned. Jose received an Associate of Arts degree in Electrical Engineering, and completed special training at Florida International University. The training enabled him to land a job with WSVN-CHANNEL 7, the local NBC affiliate. Seven years later, Jose became the News Operations Director for WKGM/WCPX-TV in Orlando, Florida.

Since entering the field of broadcasting, Jose has held a number of positions. After only four years, WFOR-CBS4 offered Jose the Director of Technical Operations position, which was in charge of the overall technical operation of the station. Two years later, he became Director of Broad Cast Operations and Engineering, which is the top technical position for CBS in the South Florida area. Jose Garcia is an Advisory Board member on the Television Production Program Advisory Committee for Miami-Dade County Public Schools' Division of Applied Technology. He also participates in many charitable and community organizations.

In Jose's opinion, the vocational electronics program at Hialeah Senior High gave him the jump-start he needed to succeed in American society. "It opened up many doors for me. Mr. Phil Goodman was the instructor, and he was terrific. A true mentor, Mr. Goodman led me down the road to success. Today, I enjoy an interesting and exciting career in Broadcast Television."

Subject:	George Dorsett / Violation of rights

Sir,
Greetings on behalf of the Bithlo Citizens Advisory Council, Chairman, Cory E. Goodman.
 
It is with great sadness that I contact you in order to make you aware of some very disturbing information which has been provided to me by Orange County Attorney, George Dorsett.
In a recent hearing before the Honorable Judge  Gail Adams, Mr. Dorsett inferred that the person responsible for the recent criminal abduction of this writer on 10-17-02 was the Sheriff of Orange County.
 
I have been attempting to have this matter brought to a logical conclusion at the local level, however, it appears that the county attorney is pointing fingers at your office in an attempt to convince interested individuals that civil liabilities for the criminal deprivation of my right to free speech, are your responsibility.
I do not have much faith in Mr. Dorsetts ability to tell the truth, due to his past bad acts which have been reported to the Florida Bar, however, I do know that I provided your employee, George Swingle, a copy of the court order from Judge Komanski which clearly stated that I have a constitutional right to contact my elected officials, as provided under the first amendment.
Amazingly, over a year and a half later, I was abducted and falsely charged with violating an injunction for writing my elected officials regarding the conduct of county staff.
 
These false charges were "nol prossed" after the presiding Judge inquired 
"why has it taken over a year and a half to determine probable cause in this case?"
 
There was no case as evident by the order of Judge Komanski, thereby eliminating any chance of a lawful arrest.
 
However, I was placed upon home confinement for a period of 45 days PRIOR to being found guilty of any crime OR even given a trial of any kind. I have been informed that I have legal grounds to file a civil suit against Orange County for this malicious prosecution and negligent infliction of emotional distress.
Naturally, Orange County attorney Dorsett has passed the blame to someone other that Orange County government and implicated your office as the reckless wrongdoer.
 
Sheriff Beary, as a fourth generation resident of the area, I have witnessed this type of abuse spread throughout east orange county and am hopeful for your assistance to regain the good name the Orange County Sheriffs office enjoyed during the Dave Starr years. As a childhood friend of my grandfather, Luke Goodman, Dave Starr was my childhood idol. I admired his leadership qualities and long for the days when a citizen could rely on the sheriff to make corrections when good cops go bad.
 
Which brings me to the point of this letter.
 
I am graciously offering you the opportunity to provide me the appropriate apology from the staff who may have played a part in this unfortunate problem, as described by Dorsett.
I do know that when I spoke with George Swingle prior to providing a copy of the Judges order, I was told that " I don't see anything wrong here that I can put you in jail for."
 
I thought that was the end of the matter until a year and a half later when I was criminally abducted for exercising my right to free speech. I am confident that any American would concur that this type of abuse should be punished by the courts,but I do not feel that taxpayers should shoulder the debt for the mistakes of county staff. I much prefer an apology and any explanation possible.
 
Thank You for your attention in this regard and please do not hesitate to contact me for any additional details you may require in this matter.
 
Sincerely,
Chairman, Cory E. Goodman

Mr. Jeb Bush
Florida Govenor
Tallahassee, FL 
 
Dear Mr. Bush,
 
I am writing in reference to the financial cuts for the Southwest Social Serv., located
at 25 Tamiami Blvd, Miami FL 33144.  My elderly, sick dad, Dionisio Kamanel
gets food delivered by this agency daily at a lower cost.  Please do not stop or decrease
the funding to this agency because the elderly, low income people will loose this good benefit
that this agency provides. 
 
Thank you for your efforts.
 
Sincerely,
 
Mrs. Martha Rockwell

Subject:	Re: What about.....?

Bob confirmed what he told you today.

However, this is not what is described in the implementing bill language
written for the Gov's Recs and it is not what Bob stated when he spoke with
Meta and I a few weeks ago.

I just spoke with Meta- she read me the language: states that adults who
would be provided the pharmacy benefit would have to spend down to the
current Silver Saver program income requirement of 120% of FPL ( and not
down to the May 1 share of cost level). This is what I understood to be the
proposal when I spoke with Donna and Bob last fall

I asked Meta to forward the language to me on email and to ask Donna as well
what she understood the proposal to say about the 'share of cost'
requirement.

I will get back with you with clarification

rhonda, i just spoke with bob.  the governor's proposal, as i understand it
from bob, does not address the share of cost requirement.  The May 1 level
of 450 would still be the spend down amount under his proposal.  Therefore,
advancing the start from July 1 to May 1 would not address the share of cost
issue, which is the crux of the problem.  Based on this information, it is
not advisable to move the Governor's recomendation to May 1, as if we do
this, the spend down will still be a problem, AND there will be no
hospital/doc care, which is what would occur July 1.  
Please confirm this with Bob.  Meta and I just got off phone with him.

	For the Medicaid Spin Down program May 1st issue 

	If the Gov did want to propose/support any new legislation now,
could he 
	recommend starting his proposed program for FY 03-04 early -ie start
in May 
	instead of July? 

	His recommendations for this program has: 
	1- a lower share of cost requirement than the one that is scheduled
to start 
	May 1 
	2- it provides full drug coverage ie the main concern reported about
in the 
	press stories, letters to the Gov, etc... And would help the
transplant 
	patients 
	The downside: they would trade off their coverage for
hospital/doctor visits 
	costs 2 months early 

	Is it even possible to do something like this as an alternative to: 
	(A) not intervening in the upcoming May 1 program change with
legislation 
	(B) the request by advocates, etc. for budget ammendment for $8.3
million 
	for the months of May and June (temporary restoration) 

	Too complicated? 
	If this could be done thru "emergency legislation": 
	-Pregnant women & kids can stay as is now 
	-For adults, would have to roll all 24,000 of them quickly into
Silver Saver 
	-But first would have to get a waiver ammendment approved by CMS
-not sure 
	CMS could/would move fast enough for us.

It may be uncaring and even unethical for a hospital to remove someone from
their transplant waiting list- but it is not illegal
See info below

Also: transplants are not considered "emergenicies" - (not acute or sudden
onset) so hospitals are not required to perform them for everyone

Governor,
 
I'm sorry I didn't have a more intelligent question for you today. Session is really wearing me out.
 
The issue I'd like to explore is the difference between job perception and reality. 
 
For example, my perception of the Tallahassee Press Corps differed from the reality of working up here. I thought the Capitol reporters were the state's best but didn't have to work as hard as their counterparts on  the City Desk. Instead, I've learned they actually work harder. I've also learned that geography plays a larger role in landing a job up here than I imagined, given the disproportionate number of former Democrat reporters.
 
I know my readers would be fascinated by a glimpse of your Tallahassee experience. What were your suspicions about Tallahassee coming in, how accurate were those views and how have they evolved over time with regard to your office, the state government machine, special interests, the media and lobbyists?
 
If I can get an answer to the question above and a little insight into how the pressures of the job have changed your lifestyle, I think I'll be able to look you in the eye after this article runs. It would help me humanize you and raise the story above political differences.
 
As you said during today's press availability, the job is as dynamic as the office-holder wants it to be and you choose to keep pretty busy. How has your commitment to the position changed your life? I mean, it doesn't seem like you have much down time.
 
Respectfully,
Victor Epstein

we will keep trying. I believe policy should be based on reality and not perception. Sadly, perception drives environmental policy too much. I received this email recently from a committed environmentalist:

"On the Everglades you or your people have:

-Resolved the 8.5 SMA controversy
-Prioritized state funding for CERP

-Signed the reservations water agreement with the President
-Given us 5 of 6 issues on programmatic regulations
-Committed to 10 parts per billion in the phosphorous rule

I guess this sums up my frustrations. In addition, to have folks say that there have been secret meetings with sugar companies when they themselves have been part of these meetings is pretty amazing. Perception over reality reigns supreme!

Happy Easter to you and yours.

Bush lashes out at Everglades critics

   The governor supports changes to a cleanup bill; environmentalists want to get the public involved.

      By JULIE HAUSERMAN, Times Staff Writer

      Â© St. Petersburg Times

      published April 18, 2003

 http://www.sptimes.com/2003/04/18/State/Bush_lashes_out_at_Ev.shtml

TARPON SPRINGS -- Gov. Jeb Bush blasted environmentalists Thursday as they turned up the political heat on him for supporting
an Everglades cleanup bill that the sugar industry is pushing through the state Legislature.

"Environmental politics is like, so politically correct, so focused on perception rather than reality, that I'm going to do what's right,"
Bush said when asked about the bill during a visit to the Tarpon Springs campus of St. Petersburg College. "If you sense a degree
of irritation in my voice, it's probably an accurate sense.

"In all honesty, I think we're working hard to create a continued progress in the Everglades. I'm not going to be so worried about
political correctness. I've learned that that's short-lived."

Bush has called cleanup of the polluted Everglades one of his top priorities, and environmentalists have supported him for it.

But starting Saturday, environmentalists will blanket Florida with TV ads urging people to call Bush to tell him to stop the bill that
changes Florida's Everglades Forever Act.

The hard-hitting ads talk about the influence of "Big Sugar" and show envelopes of cash being slipped into suit coat pockets. The
Everglades Trust is paying for them.

A growing list of Washington lawmakers -- Democrat and Republican -- have come out publicly to say the bill is bad news and
threatens the flow of federal dollars for Everglades cleanup.

U.S. Interior Secretary Gale Norton also expressed concerns about it this week. U.S. and Florida taxpayers are splitting the
$8.4-billion cleanup tab, so cooperation with Washington is crucial.

Thursday, Florida U.S. Sens. Bill Nelson and Bob Graham wrote a letter to Bush warning that members of a congressional budget
committee have threatened to cut off money for Everglades restoration if Florida keeps making changes to the cleanup law.

On the campaign trail for his run for president, Graham said there's concern in Congress that the bill "may represent a retreat from
the state's Everglades restoration."

Bush maintained Thursday that the bill won't harm the federal-state partnership. He said the bill will "enhance" the Everglades
Forever Act, "and we'll do so without jeopardizing funding from our federal partners."

Critics say the bill delays a key Everglades cleanup deadline by 20 years. Bush denied that.

With the legislative session ending in two weeks and the bill moving rapidly, environmentalists are taking their case to the airwaves.

"Big Sugar has hired 46 lobbyists, more than one for each senator," says one of the ads. "Why would Big Sugar contribute nearly a
million dollars to Florida lawmakers?" says another. "Why? Because that's what it takes to pass a law allowing Big Sugar to pollute
the Everglades -- and force Florida taxpayers to pay for the cleanup . . . How can we stop it? The answer is Jeb Bush. Governor
Bush said restoring the Everglades is one of his top priorities."

Jim Krog, a lobbyist for the Flo-Sun sugar company, said the ads are "disheartening."

"This industry has done more for the restoration of the Everglades than anyone in the state, anyone in the country, anyone in the
world," Krog said. "It's disheartening that you take an industry that works 10 years on trying to solve a problem . . . that it always
deteriorates to this."

U.S. Sugar Corp. issued a statement saying the environmentalists were "Crying wolf! Again."

The Everglades Trust spent about $1-million to run the ads, said Nat Reed of Jupiter Island, a former environmental adviser to six
Florida governors and to President Richard Nixon.

"The governor has been badly briefed and badly misled, and I think he needs to listen very carefully to the Congress," Reed said at a
Tallahassee press conference.

Dear Governor Bush:

 I would like to recommend Judge Michael Andrews' selection as a Circuit Judge in the Sixth Circuit. I have known Judge Andrews for nearly twenty years since college:  He is smart, dedicated and a true public servant.  Judge Andrews believe that a judge's role is to follow the law and not make it.  Although he is dedicated to the law, he is also actively involved in community youth mentoring and believes in serving as a role model.  As an African-American, I believe that Judge Andrews' selection would address the lack of racial diversity on the Sixth Circuit bench.  He is qualified and would make you proud if you selected him.  Thank you for your consideration.

Carolyn Olson's worker went out yesterday.  She said Ms. Ayres rejected her
referrals to the food bank, the health dept. and to county social services.
She is going to Good Samaritan today but informed the worker that, if they
prescribe drugs or surgery, she will reject it.

She has her mobile home, which the worker said is quite lovely, up for sale.
Apparently, she still has quite a bit of furniture and other things that she
sells as she needs to pay a bill.  However, she is two months behind in her
mortgage.  Ms. Ayres believes that if someone would just take care of her
mortgage payments everything would be fine.  There are no resources to do
that and she will probably be facing foreclosure in the future.  However,
she does have a friend in Clearwater who will take her into her home.

I am concerned about her complete rejection of traditional medicine but she
is a competent adult who must be allowed to choose for herself.  It will
mean that there is little chance of ever being able to establish disability
on her.  Please let me know if you want us to do anything further on this
case.

TWO EDUCATION FIRMS GET $10 MILLION FOR WORKING IN IRAQ
The U.S. Agency for International Development awarded two key Iraqi
reconstruction contracts yesterday worth a combined $10 million, one to a
North Carolina research firm to help develop local governance and another
to a Washington company to help rebuild the public schools system.  In
winning its $7.9 million contract, RTI International of Research Triangle
Park, N.C., became the first nonprofit group to receive one of the prime
government awards to help rebuild Iraq. D.C.-based consulting firm
Creative Associates International Inc. received a $2 million schools
contract. Both awards are for an initial one-year period.  The agency has
awarded half of its eight initial reconstruction contracts aimed at
providing emergency assistance to Iraq. The Bush administration is
proposing to spend $2.4 billion on humanitarian and reconstruction aid.
Critics, including some members of Congress, have complained that the
bidding process has been too secretive and has shut out qualified
companies.

thanks for the leadership and great job during very trying times
 
i represent the village of wellington (palm beach county) and we are a place that discharges into the everglades and have been working away at lowering the phosphorus in our discharges.  this effort has been ongoing for a couple of years and is working, through best management practices such as, horse waste and fertilizer control. these methods have lowered our phosphorus discharge by about half, and we want to finish our needed work by 2006.
 
a letter has been developed and signed by the village manager that supports most of the parts of the current legislation, especially the 1 mil and the technology approach.  we have not taken a position on the timeframes as that section of the bill has been unclear.
 
the village council is dedicated to doing the right thing for the everglades and will be up the final week of the session and i would sincerely appreciate the opportunity to have the council members (about 3) and the manager meet with you for a couple of minutes.  i believe that the 30th is the day they will be in tallahassee.
 
thank you for your kind consideration and i hope to be able to see you,

DEAR GOVERNOR BUSH,

MY NAME IS EUNICE GOINS AND MY HUSBAND'S NAME IS
JIMMIE GOINS, WE FIRST WROTE TO YOU BACK IN DECEMBER,
IN REGARDS TO OUR NIECE, LETICIA CARRILLO-GARCIA. 
(CASE #5083628-CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRTEENTH
JUDICIAL CIRCUIT FOR HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY) SHE WAS
REMOVED FROM OUR HOME DUE TO LOVING HER TOO MUCH. 
SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT THE REASONS FOR THE MOVE WAS A
TRANSPORTATION ISSUE, DUE TO THE MOTHER (MELISSA
BALFOUR) HAVING TROUBLE GETTING TO SEBRING FROM
LAKELAND.  I OFFERED TO DRIVE LETICIA BACK AND FORTH
FOR THE VISITATIONS, I EVEN STATED THAT IN COURT-I
BELIEVE IN OCTOBER. REGARDLESS, THIS WAS A MOVE THAT
SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MADE.

SINCE DECEMBER, LETICIA HAS HAD NO CONTACT WITH ANY OF
THE FAMILY, OTHER THAN HER MOTHER.  I CAN NOT BELIEVE
THAT THE STATE WOULD ALLOW A CHILD BE RIPPED AWAY FROM
FAMILY AND PLACE THAT CHILD IN  FOSTER CARE WITH NO
CONTACT WHAT SO EVER WITH THE FAMILY THAT SHE HAD
FORMED A BOND WITH.  I FIND THIS TO BE CRUEL,
HEARTLESS, AND ABUSIVE, NOT TO MENTION TRAUMATIZING TO
THE CHILD.

I AM ONCE, AGAIN, ASKING YOU FOR YOUR HELP.  I WAS
INFORMED THE LAST TIME I WROTE TO YOU THAT THE
SITUATION WAS OUT OF YOUR JURISDICTION.  AS YOU KNOW
THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A PERMANENCY LAW-STATING THAT A
PARENT HAS 12 MONTHS TO GET IT TOGETHER OR THEIR
RIGHTS BE TERMINATED.  WELL THIS LAW IS NOT BEING
FOLLOWED, MY QUESTION IS WHY?  WHEN I KNOW FOR A FACT
THE THE MOTHER IS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH HER CASE
PLAN.  SHE DOESN'T HAVE A JOB, SHE DOES NOT HAVE A
STEADY HOME AND SHE IS NOT ATTENDING THE HANDS ON
PARENTING CLASSES.  IT HAS BEEN 19 MONTHS SINCE HER
CHILDREN WERE REMOVED FROM HER HOME, SURELY SHE HAS
HAD TIME TO STRAIGHTEN UP. HOW MUCH LONGER DOES
LETICIA HAVE TO SUFFER?  THE NEXT COURT DATE IS MAY
14,2003, I HOPE THAT THIS MATTER IS WITHIN YOUR
JURISDICTION, AND THAT YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO END
THIS TRAGEDY.

Dear Governor Bush,
Saw you in Clearwater with the Glenn Beck's Honor America and have been
reading about your ideas on the Reading problems.  Rolling Readers Space
Coast Volunteers have been helping children in Title I Brevard County
Schools for past 6 years.  Presently, we are in the process of getting
good-quality books ready for the 5000 children we help with READ ALOUD
and TUTOR/MENTOR Programs.   The children will receive the books during
the last week of April to keep for their very own.  Sometimes, these are
the only good books the children have to call their own.

Our unique TUTOR/MENTOR Program is very unique and our trained tutors
help children increase their reading by 4 or 5 books levels in one school
year.  Sometimes, it takes one-on-one for children to get over "the
hump."  

We know Rolling Readers Space Coast is one of the very best programs
because we have some of the very best trained, dedicated, focused and
caring volunteers.  The children love us, the teachers want us,
principals need us and the Superintendents want us to succeed.  WE DO
MAKE A DIFFERENCE EVERY DAY!

Wish we could sit down and talk to you about our wonderful READING
LITERACY PROGRAMS.   i KNOW WE CAN HELP WHERE NEEDED!

I have sent you materials but you may not have had the time to read all
about us.  The new Senator from Brevard County, Mike Haridopolos,  is
very familiar with Rolling Readers and he has been a good supporter. 
Hopefully, this year we can get funding support from Florida.  Our budget
is not exorbitant!  It is only about $50,000 (drop in the bucket) because
we do not pay for RENT nor UTILITIES.  WE ARE HOUSED IN AREA I
SUPERINTENDENT'S BUILDING at 1948 Pineapple Avenue, Melbourne, Florida
32935.

Over 250 trained volunteers in 21 Brevard County Title I Schools help
5000 children in pre-kindergarten through third grade with LISTENING and
READING SKILLS to read independently and with comprehension.   NO CHILD
SHALL BE LEFT BEHIND!    Our mission is to have children learn the love
and joy of READING bY the 3rd grade.   IN THE 4TH GRADE  they MUST READ
TO LEARN FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.   READING IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS IN
EVERYTHING WE DO.

HAVE A VERY HAPPY EASTER WITH YOUR LOVELY FAMILY1    Tell your brother,
President Bush,   he is loved and we all pray for him.   God will help
him, his advisors and staff  to think,  do,  say  and   write   the right
things.

Subject: TSA Contract



It's been awhile since I last e mailed you.  I want to thank you for your help with the Child Support issue.  The State Attorney's Office is representing me, but unfortunately I am still not receiving child support nor close to receiving any child support.  The fact that your office inquired about my case has helped tremendously.  If the State Attorney finds that he has lied about his income and employment status, I hope State Attorney's Office will pursue criminal charges against him because it is criminal what he has done.  My parent's have had to help cover some of my daughter's expenses.  What people find hard to believe is, that he doesn't pay child support, yet he enjoys his frequent visitation and that he is able to meet his financial monthly obligations, money for legal fees, but not for child support.  If he truly doesn't have money for child support, then how does he have money for weekend visits and outings.  That could be an incentive to discourage Father's who stop paying child support just to get back at an ex-spouse.   

My real purpose for writing to you is regarding my family's company, General Patrol Service's contract with TSA.  I e-mailed the Defense Department and copied you on that e-mail.  I have been told by the Defense Department itself, that many companies which are in the same position as we are, have rallied support from their elected officials to help put pressure and keep pressure on the Defense Department to finalize and close out the contracts.  I know that you are a State elected official, and not a Congressman or Senator.  But with your power and influence as the Governor of the State of Florida, you can put pressure on the Defense Department.  Senator Graham is campaigning, and I personally don't know anyone in his office.  Lincoln Diaz Balart's office, Ana Carbonell, stated that she wrote a letter on our behalf, but I haven't seen a copy of that letter, and their office seems very busy with immigration issues.  I don't even know if Congressman Lincoln Diaz Balart even knows that I contacted his office.  I was hoping and counting on your help.

The e mail I copied you, explains the outstanding invoices and that we have reached a "Mexican standoff ."  According to the terms and provisions of our contract, the Defense Department owes us the outstanding invoices that were FedEx in February, the "Contract Award Amount" which estimates about $400,000.00, the Employee Incentive Bonuses and Vacation Pay, and the PLB.  I would greatly appreciate your support and help in this matter.

Please let me know, if you will be able to help me.

dear governor bush - to identify myself i campaigned very aggressively for you on your very first (unsuccessful)  and second campaigns in broward county particularly in the arts community and the school district - both as you well know, very hostile territories -  i have decided to send you this note out of great concern regarding what i understand is advice you are receiving from those who have not looked carefully  through the window called "Future" -
there are many of us who campaigned for you that are thankful for the fact that the State Library bill did not pass - we (bush supporters) understand this to be a blessing to you  in disguise -
 now we are facing the same situation with cuts for arts and culture organizations - while everyone knows cuts are necessary, these specific radical cuts are viewed by the community at large as your way of "getting even" for the vote on smaller classrooms - it is also viewed as "typical republican lack of care for culture" - 
 rumor has already started indicating that democrats in the legislature oppose these cuts but republicans who favor them are in a majority and cuts  will pass - already very strong, vocal and visual opposition is beginning - 
a few days ago i met paul sallarullo at a function - privately commenting the situation i indicated my concern viewing all this as political suicide - paul's response "i know it is, but i guess cuts have to be made somewhere" -
the cuts for the arts/culture organizations will mean in many, many cases closure and loss of employment for thousands - the effect on children and families will be felt for years to come - the tourist industry will be affected severely with more loss of jobs -
i believe your legacy is at stake here - all your accomplishments will be forgotten because as you know the arts and culture communities are very strong  and vocal -
i hope you will excuse the liberty i take in writing to you about this matter - i ask, if possible, that you take another look and perhaps reconsider/make changes in some way - if i can be of any help at all please do not hesitate to call - thanks for "listening" and good luck- un abrazo a Columba - martha gutierrez-Steinkamp

Thank you for writing. 
 
In response to the green paragraph, school districts have that option available to them. I think all of them have focused on intensive focus during the regular school year. remember, F schools get $1000 per student more than A schools. 
 
1. this is in essence our plan for third graders and twelve graders. There should be ongoing efforts to assure that the struggling students make it. 
2. Some school districts offer bonuses for teachers that go to F schools. I think this is the best approach.
 
F schools have historically not stayed F schools because of the focus that they get. That is kind of the point! 
 
I really appreciate your writing and more importantly, I appreciate your incredible work on behalf of our next generation.

Subject: Florida League Meeting


Hi Governor Bush,
I was at the Florida League of Teachers meeting this past weekend and it was so great to have you and Commissioner Horne give us the "heads up" about current education issues.  I was the younger woman who came up to the front and took several photos while you were speaking.  By the way, I am Carol Martin's daughter.  We are the only mother/daughter League members to-date.  I'm pretty proud of that!
 
I have an idea and I'm sure it's been brought up before, but here goes.....
Most of the schools with the "F" rating are in poor, minority neighborhoods.  I agree that every child can learn, but I also believe that not every child learns at the same pace.  There are certain cultural and financial issues that supercede the great strides in education being delivered by those teachers.  What if schools who earn a rating of "F" were provided funding to extend the next school year by 30 days?  45 days?  Talk about putting the money where it's needed, it would do two important things:
 
1.  It would provide an additional marking period for those students to "catch up", while "keeping up".  They would still take the FCATs at the same time as other schools, but they would continue preparing the students to meet the Sunshine State Standards for their current grade levels before promoting them in August.  It would provide additional time to focus on basic skills and give the kids an opportunity to practice those skills for longer periods of time.
 
2.  Many teachers are forced to work summer jobs to help make ends meet.  Many teachers won't volunteer to work in the "F" schools during the 196 day contract, but they may be inclined to transfer if they could be guaranteed their daily rate for a substantial number of additional days.  For veteran teachers, this could be financially lucrative..... enough to encourage talented teachers from transferring to schools with higher ratings/SES populations or just retiring.
 
Once a school had earned a rating above "F" for a designated period of time (2 years?), they could return to the school calendar we currently observe.  It's basically mandatory Summer Session for every student in the "F" school.  If an entire school ranked in the bottom level, don't they need Summer Session???
 
I know it's idealistic and would be very expensive.  It was just a thought.  I'd love to hear yours, when you get a chance.  Take care and have a Happy Easter!!!

Subject:	Disgraceful act(s) of arrogant insensitivity / Public records request (F.S. 119)

To the hand of TOM KING,
 
At the behest of the Bithlo community, which has elected this writer as spokesman and community Representative on numerous civic agencies and boards, I am writing to voice the extreme displeasure of my constituents regarding the disgraceful and abusive "Easter Egg Hunt/ Health Fair" which benefited non-residents to the exclusion of Bithlo residents on 4-19-03 at the Bithlo Government center.
 
Early this morning I began receiving phone calls from outraged residents of Bithlo who were awakened with non-residents parking automobiles on the roadways and lawns in front of these residents homes near the government center.No Bithlo residents were seen in this mob of Wedgefield and Bonneville residents and none have proffered anything except disgust at the amount of public money which was used to make it appear that citizens from the community were finally being provided a small amount of attention to their urgent needs, particularly, local control of community property.
 
I myself witnessed what can most charitably be described as the worst traffic jam in Bithlo history due to non-residents parking in the roadway and in Bithlo residents yards without permission. I am confident that this was permitted by TOM KING and his co-horts to further infuriate the residents of the community who currently feel disenfranchised by TOM KING and his constant groveling for wealthy non-residents and personal friends from outlying areas.
 
Therefore, in the interest of eliminating the chance for this type of abuse to be repeated on my watch, I am requesting, under the provisions of Florida Statute 119, commonly referred to as the GOVERNMENT IN THE SUNSHINE LAW, any and all documentation in possession of Orange County Government, which contains public information regarding public funding spent on this wasteful disgrace held on 4-19-03 at the Bithlo government center on Washington Ave. in the Bithlo community.
 
These files/ documents should contain the amount of overtime pay for non-resident employees who facilitated  this event, as well as how much public money was wasted/ spent on any other item(s) which were purchased at any time for use in this disgraceful event.
It should be noted that Orange County Sheriffs deputies were witnessed turning a blind eye to the criminal acts of non-residents who illegally parked vehicles in the roadway in front of the center. Negligence of duty should be punished and as Bithlo residents we have experienced enough lawlessness on part of the KING regime and his followers from outlying areas.
 
WE DEMAND BETTER FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OUR FUTURE THAN TO BE HELD HOSTAGE BY THESE TERRITORIAL DICTATORS!
 
If you decide to ignore this lawful request as you have numerous and countless times in the past,
 please provide a copy of the law or exemption which you feel justifies your refusal and advise me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law. Also, be advised that I have forwarded to copy of this request/ complaint to various interested individuals who have shown an interest in having the lawless activity of the TOM KING regime brought to a halt. Failure to comply with a public records request is a crime and will be dealt with in the most severe terms available.
 
I am confident that the extreme low turnout of Bithlo residents at this "event for non-residents" is due to the lack of concern that has been established by TOM KING, DEBBY ASKA  and staff regarding the hateful and racist attacks and attitudes of arrogant non-resident staff who are protected from punishment by Orange County Chairman DICK CROTTY.
Crotty has given free rein to child molester(s) GEORGE NIGHTINGALE and other non-resident staff who have earned the title of SEXUAL PREDATORS while in OUR park.
Children from the Bithlo community have no intention of becoming another notch on the belt of a confessed child molester who TOM KING claims as a close friend, the notorious GEORGE NIGHTINGALE.
Parents will not permit children to enter a park where safety is deprived of the Bithlo community by KING and ASKA, while at the same time sexual predators are given the keys to a community center where they do not reside and will not even enter unless they are paid to.
 
By now any rational person should realize that the elected leader of the Bithlo community is not going away just because KING TOM has ordered him to be silent.Rather, Bithlo residents choose instead to fight for our rights and community property as hard as we fight to ensure our precious children are not made fodder for the criminally insane minds of child molesters. 
Those who disagree, I offer them the opportunity to have GEORGE NIGHTINGALE come to YOUR community and carry out his lustful desires on YOUR children as he has ours.
 
Put your money where your mouth is or shut up!
 
I live in Bithlo...You don't!
I have to live as a hostage under the KING regime... You don't!
My community has lost all faith in local government due to KING TOM and DEBBY ASKA permitting criminal acts against our people... Yours hasn't!
 
What we don't need is to reward these despots with Federal, State or County funding.
What we do need is the opportunity to guide our own fate without unwarranted government intrusion.
 
For those who live in Bithlo, no explanation is necessary, For those who don't, no explanation is possible.
 
Stop the abuse and leave us alone, It's only fair.
 
Sincerely,
Chairman, Cory E. Goodman
Bithlo Citizens Advisory Council
Orange County Community Action Board
Orange County Republican Executive Committee (538)

Dear Governor Bush,

I wrote you shortly before Christmas and you quickly responded about ten 
minutes
later on a Friday night.

I introduced myself as Martie Tucker, an anchor at WFTS-Tampa (Don Germaise's
station) and you wrote back anyway! (I almost kept that information to 
myself.)  I was seeking an interview with you and
Mrs. Bush.

To bring you up to date, I've been in touch with Leslie Steele who is
in the process of arranging something once your two schedules permit.

I have since left WFTS and re-joined WFTV in Orlando where I worked for a
number of years as Martie Salt.  Took back my maiden name when I returned 
because that's what I was known as when I left.

Just wanted to touch base with you and let you know my interest has not at
all changed since that first e-mail.  I look forward to seeing you both again.

Sincerely,
Martie Salt

As you know,the Federal Transportation funding bill(TEA 21) expires this
year.The President has not been a strong proponent for raising the amount to
be spent in the next bill and he has stated that he doesn't think
Transportation spending is an effective stimulus because it takes so long to
go from appropriation to laying concrete and creating jobs.As I look at all
the states we operate in,Florida is the one state with a healthy
economy-even despite the huge drop off in tourism.I believe the BIG
DIFFERENCE is that after 9-11,you passed a stimulus package that was
headlined by a big boost in transportation spending.Today,we are reaping the
benefit of your foresite,while other states that cut back on transportation
spending are mired in the doldrums of a flat economy.
It is important to America to improve out transportation infrastructure and
it is important to us Republicans to reelect the President.He would be smart
to take a page out of your book and use the reauthorization of TEA 21 as a
way to stimulate the economy.Even if you believe his premise that the
stimulus isn't immediate(and I don't believe that),you come to the
conclusion that the stimulus would kick in right at the time he needs it
most for his reelection.
Please talk to him about this.We need a better Transportation system and we
need his continued leadership;a strong reauthorization of TEA 21 does
both.Thanks.

Dear  Governor Bush:
 
I know this is the subject of much talk and has everybody in a lather. It seems to me that everybody wants to take away patients rights, rather than focus on the real problem. I am currently involved in a pending suite that should settle for $250,000 to $500,000. The normal atty. fee is 30% but we were ask to sign an agreement at 40% plus costs. It was explained that sometimes costs can run up to about 10%. I do not believe that this case will ever go to court. The plaintiff stands to get approximately 50% of what ever is awarded.
 
I remember when advertising for the legal profession was akin to ambulance chasing . Now the attys. can make so much money that they cover the airways with advertising . The caps need to be put on the legal costs not the plaintiff awards. If any other profession tried to reap these benefits you and everybody in government would be yelling price gouging. It's no wonder everybody wants to be an atty. This is better than the Florida lottery.
 
this problem not only effects the medical profession I pay more form my Insurance , home, car, medical etc. and I also pay more for the products and services I buy because of increased costs to businesses. This is the greatest taxation without representation there is. 
 
And I guess that the screaming Drs. will get what looks to them a solution to their problem and only the poor sucker who gets butchered will be the looser and once again we will put a bandaid on an amputation. Until somebody does tort reform and limits the drain on the system by curbing legal costs no one wins. But fat chance of that when you look and see who runs the government and look at their law degrees.

Dear Governor:

I wanted to make you aware of two important events that are upcoming (formal
invitations attached).

The first event deals with our Chairman's Circle of 100.  Tuesday (April 15)
I received a call from Washington requesting that I put together a group of
top Miami business leaders to meet with Ruben King Shaw to learn, directly
from the White House staff, the details of President Bush's jobs and growth
package.  Washington requested this meeting be next Wednesday, April 23 and
we were pleased to accommodate them as well as to welcome Ruben back to
Miami.

The concept for the Circle of 100 came about after your last visit to the
Chamber.  I felt the need to be able to quickly assemble a small group of
Miami business leaders that could come together on short notice for meetings
of high importance.  I hope that you will  be able to meet with this group
soon and as often as you deem necessary as these are the leaders of Greater
Miami.

The second event is the Spring Social for our Senior Executive Orientation
which will be held on Fisher Island.  We have included the Circle of 100,
the Chamber's Executive Committee and Board of Governors in this event.
Please let me know if you and Mrs. Bush would like to attend.

We continue to work on those programs and efforts that make Miami-Dade
County a great place.  I know that you are in the waning days of session, I
wish you the best of luck in securing solutions to the many challenges of
our great State.

Regards,

Bill

Jeb, I understand and appreciate your dilemma with this appointment.  
Frank Mann remains an excellent choice, but has withdrawn his name as 
I understand.  Doris Bella was endorsed by me many months ago.  She is 
a bright, capable business woman with a solid Republican track 
record.  Doris has continued to seek information about the health 
system and to ask good questions.  Unfortunatly, other candidates seem 
to demonstrate little interest in learning about the heath system.  As 
chairman of this board, I hope to have new member willing to commit 
the time and energy required.
On another note, I thank you for your ongoing support to registered 
nurses and nurse practitioners.  It is an ongoing legislative battle 
for prescriptive authority which meets patients' needs.

I hope you will take the time to personally review it. I guarentee if you watch the video CD, you will be inspired by the work of young children helping others. It would be great if you would come and be part of our backpack delivery caravan in early August. It would mean so much to a homeless or migrant child to have the Governor help them to choose a new backpack and books. I was proud of your stand on Literacy. As you will read in the packet, Kids 4 Kids has delivered over 23,000 backpacks filled with school supplies and over 50,000 new books to kids who need them. My new vision was not in the packet. It is for a book recycling mobile. My plan is to invite schools to have book recycling drives (we collected 6,000 in two weeks at our school) to allow kids to bring in their gently used books. We would then load them up on a bookmobile (that I am trying to raise funds for) and drive them to schools where kids cannot afford the luxury of owning their own books. My goal once we have the bus is to collect and distribute 250,000 books each year to kids so that they can learn to love reading. Are there any state funding sources we can tap into as a 501(C)3 or can you pass my packet along to anyone in the business community who might help to fund the program?

  Dear Sir,
       I was just inquiring as to why a book was sent out to CAFE attendees with a pre-determined scripted list of questions? Aren't you not interested in having the parents ask questions which are uncensored? You seem to be an open minded kind of guy and I think you really do care about families, and serving them. Patrick McMillan is one of your staunchest supporters. He was a complete gentleman, when we spoke. The fact that you wanted my cell phone number for your list of state resources, I was most honored, as this means to me that you really want to help families. Perhaps that is why I was both baffled and disappointed that you have chosen to change your format for the Governor's address at CAFE this year. By not allowing parents the opportunity to ask their own questions and address their own concerns for this year's CAFE. All voices and fresh ideas are how we continue to remain a democracy and improve. Many families have contacted me in regards to this issue upon receiving the CAFE book. I am very honest and respectful of other peoples opinions and I can be a great conduit to you for what families are needing and wanting. If you would consider letting me sit on your committee of the Blue Ribbon task force, I would add immesureably to your committee. If that is not possible, would you consider inviting me to attend your ball in December? I am a registered Republican, and I voted for both you as well as your brother.   I serve all families of all needs in an unbiased, truthful, and professional manner.
  On a side note, I think your brother did a great job in winning the war! Despite a speech impediment as well as an LD growing up, he still managed to become the President of the US. Your parents did not give up on him or lower the bar. The fact that he had self-determination and persevered, he set the bar and proved sky's the limit. The families in Florida are no different. We determine our own destiny, and with you providing the supports, they can make their dreams a reality. You brother is an inspiration to me.

Ambassador Luis Lauredo

Luis,

Aloha and Good Morning,

In addition to being one of the presenters at the Florida League of Cities meeting this coming weekend, I have a series of speaking engagements around the state in the next 30 days. I will have many hats on, which include Sister Cities International, the new Regional International Business Council, the Rotary/SCI "Wheelchairs for Peace" program, and the FTAA. Under the Sister City umbrella, I will be speaking on the economic impact that Fort Lauderdale and South Florida have received under the $100 million in 'accountable' economic development programing, the past two years, with Sister Cities. I am speaking to 8 other State League of Cities as arranged by the National League of Cities. In addition, Sister Cities International has set meetings with Mayors and their economic development community in 11 major cities across the U.S. during the next six months to discuss the formula of success for these public/private partnerships. The Mayors do the inviting, and we draw solid participation from the business community. It is my desire to assimilate the ABF into each of these speaking engagements. 
MY IBC presentations will be made to our tri-county city councils, commissions, and the respective County Commissions urging them to approve (a pre-politicted) resolution of support for the FTAA Secretariat and the ABF.
As I am sure you are aware, I have already made the winning of the FTAA Secretariat a part of my presentation, and always stress it's impact and importance to the United States.
Accordingly, if we are on the same page, I would appreciate any and all material, that we have available, to assist me to educate and promote the ABF as I live this public service quest.

I hope you have a peaceful Easter with your family.
Cordially, Randy

Subject: Changes to the Everglades Forever Act


Dear Governor, I cannot tell you how distressed and disappointed I am about the  dangerous game being played by the sugar industry in subverting the Everglades  restoration process at a time that Louisana is pushing for a 15 billion dollar program to restore its rapidly eroding coastline, California has the Calfed process underway to restore wetlands in San Francisco Bay, the upper Mississippi valley is developing a major river restoration project, the Great Lakes Governors are working on major restoration programs and other areas are looking at the deal we cut and are trying to get a share of Corps appropriations. Other areas are astounded that we got not only a 50-50 cost share for land aquisition and construction but the perpetual cost share of operating the facilities as well. This is an unprecedented departure from past  congressional appropriations commitments for Corps projects. It is Congress that  the industry is defying and you will reap the whirlwind. of the adverse Congressional reaction. As  I am sure you have been advised, the Appropriations  subcommittees are furious at this unilateral approach to changing the deal we all made with them. There is still time to avoid this potential for disaster. I urge you to convene DOI,EPA, DOJ and Corps representatives in Tallahassee to reveiw and advise you of  any issues they have with the bills and that you request the Legislative Leaders to delay these bills until you and they can ,develop a consensus approach to recommend to the legislature. Sincerely,Richard A. Pettigrew

Dear Governor Bush,
     Our local newspaper, the Star Banner in Ocala, has announced that you may soon appoint Marion County School Superintendant, Jim Warford to a new position in the Department of Education in Tallahassee.  It is rumored that his assistant, Jim Yancy is considered by you for appointment to finish out Mr. Warford's vacated term.  I would like very much for you to consider Dr. Evelyn Kelly, whose bio you will find below.  There is no one else who is as well credentialed, or who understands what is going on in education, today, and what to do about it. She is fully familiar with of all the local key personnell in education. She is willing and is prepared to make some positive strides, if she is appointed by you.
     In the 1992 Republican primary for Superintendant, Dr. kelly beat Jim Yancy a margin of over 60 per cent.  Mr. Yancey, a Republican went on to add his name to a list in the Ocala Star Banner to endorse Dr. Kelly's Democrate opponent!  She lost to that Democrat by about 200 votes!
     Dr. Kelly is preferred by many Republicans in Marion County over Jim Yancy.  It would make us Repbulicans and a great number of teachers very happy, knowing that you might have been influenced more by many of us here in Marion County, rather than by Jim Warford's pick.
     I believe you know and remember her. I humbly ask that you please take the time to consider Dr. Kelly for this important appointment by contacing her to discuss the possibility. She is willing to meet with you. Thank you, very much.
 
Sincerely, Marguerite Bowen-Cavanaugh

...wanted to confirm that we understand Chuck Colson is to be there.  

Also, though we are just in the development stages of the mentoring of children of prisoners, here are key facts:

Prisons to pilot program: Broward CI and Tomoka

Selection process:  Parents who have children grades 6-9 (these are the typical grades we enroll to begin in the Take Stock in Children program)

Number of children:  Estimated at 35 at Tomoka and over 100 (125 estimate) from Broward.

Decision to use Take Stock as partner:  children must stay crime-free, drug-free, earn certain GPA...every parent wants better for their child ...tie to scholarship

Program enrollment: for next school year

The myflorida seems to be down so this is my private account.   Don't forget Mark Nelson, my assistant, will be at event - don't think you have met him yet.  He started Monday on our faith-based mentoring contract and very excited about it.  very hard worker.

Dear Governor Bush,
My name is Sue Mosley.  I was recently elected to the Marion County School Board in September. I am a Republican I applaud you on your decision to appoint Jim Warford to a position in Tallahassee. My concern is that The Republicans of Marion County (one of which I am proud to be) May be possibly starting some trouble. Jim Yancey will be an excellent appointment to the position of Superintendent. He will be a loyal and a dedicated Conservative and will represent the party well, if they will give him a chance.
I know there is a great movement right now for the appointment of Evelyn Kelly. Mrs. Kelly is a wonderful, bright, highly educated women, however what's best for our school system is to have someone who is willing to continue on the path that Mr. Warford has laid out for us to follow. Mrs. Kelly will stray far from that path with her vision. Mr. Yancey is the best person for this job at this time.
Thank you,

Sue Mosley

Subject:	Save the Gardens

Dear Mr.Bush....I have lived in Winter Haven since 1986 and have been fortunate to have the Gardens essentially at my back door.  I have many pleasant memories, not only of the beauty of the Gardens but her sounds as well, the paddle boat and its whistle, the Easter morning choir, the 4th of July fireworks, the Elvis impersonators, the big bands,  etc., etc. The thought of big developers moving in with their big tractors one more time absolutely makes me sick to my stomach!! The thought of their destruction of Winter Haven's historical landmark and what has brought so much money and tourism into Winter Haven over the years  causes my blood pressure to rise.  I consider myself a person of great faith and believe that there is a purpose and reason for  why things happen they way they do, but my faith, I must admit, is being tested and anger has taken its place. The only reason I can see for the decision that Mr. Reynolds and his partners have made can be summed up in one word....GREED!  In my opinion, Mr. Reynolds and his partners are using a tragedy such as 911 as their excuse and are no better than the cowards they are blaming. I understand business and how business works.  I also understand in some cases there are hidden motives and in this case, one doesn't have to look very far to find the hidden motive.  

I trust the State of Florida will act responsibly and do the honorable and right thing...... allow the Gardens to survive so that she may continue to be embraced and loved by so many of us she has touched and inspired over the years.

Listen to the people and then follow your conscience.

Thank you for your time.

The above-mentioned program has done wonders for me and my sister. Without it we will have the harder time to find a good meal. We are 93 and 95 years of age and have no way of feeding ourselves but through this supportive program. It would be a crime to older people like us to eliminate this program even to reduce it by taking food away from older people. Please think if it was one of your family member. It is known that your family have no economic problem thus has no way to measure the effect of being old without the basic need of a meal a day to save your life.
Think about what you are doing to a group of old persons in need of a meal.

Subject: 2003 Florida Certified Public Manager Program Graduation

Dear Governor JEB Bush, 

Each year the Florida Center for Public Management at FSU graduates a class of participants from the nationally recognized Certified Public Managers program. There are over 1300 Certified Public Managers in Florida from this program who make positive change in government daily. We facilitate the education of public managers so that they are equipped to implement "best management/leadership practices" while carrying out the missions of their agencies.  Our participants are the most capable public managers in Florida of understanding and implementing your improvement initiatives to modernize State government.  Our focus has always been on modernizing government. The Participants of this program are also the best equipped to move into senior leadership positions in state city and county government.  A couple of Graduates you might know are Secretary Crosby of DC and Fran Brooks of DMS.

This is a tremendous opportunity for you to reach out to ultimately thousands of state, city, and county workers through the hearts and minds of 240 of Florida's brightest public sector managers and supervisors. Our 2003 graduating class is very interested in hearing from you personally about the challenges Florida public managers will face now and in the future. 

The participants completing our program have dedicated themselves to serving Florida and have made great sacrifices to finish this program in hopes of improving government programs through increased efficiency, effectiveness, quality, and productivity. Many of them have already won Davis Productivity Awards for their improvements to government programs and deserve that recognition. Many have participated in the Governor's Sterling Challenge as well.

This year, approximately 240 managers from state (majority), city, and county government will attend the graduation program.  We would be honored by your participation and respectfully request that you address our participants from 8:30 until 9:00 am of June 10th on "Challenges Facing Florida Public Managers" This 30 minute period can be increased or decreased per the governor's need or it could be done any time the 10th, 11th, 12th, or the 13th. 

Our Theme this year is "Collaborative Leadership" 

A sample of our presenters of this year's program are: 
Russell Linden, Author of "Seamless Government" and "Collaborative Leadership"  
Lee Hinkle, The Florida State University
Fran Brooks, DMS People First
Lynn Tipton & Leigh Root, Florida League of Cities and Florida Association of Counties 
M. Bono & S. Allen, Using media to collaborate with Citizens - City of Tallahassee
Larry Woods or Commissioner Horne, DOE - Operational Excellence (Not yet confirmed) 
Leslie Street, Pennington Law 
Tim Moore, Larry Campbell, and Walter McNeill - Domestic Security  (Not yet confirmed)
Tom Patterson, American Academy of Certified Public Managers 
Jim Roberts, County Administrator, Monroe County 
And 40 graduates and participants delivering discussions on success in Florida Government 

Would you be available to address our participants on June 10th as the keynote kickoff speaker - or appear to speak impromptu any time during that week? 

FYI: Our organization, FCPM, has been the co-host of the Florida Government Technology Conference (FGTC) each year since its inception.  You spoke at FGTC 2000.

Faced with the possibility of Floridians dying from health care cuts he supported, Gov. Jeb Bush said Friday his office is looking for ways to temporarily help the most vulnerable. 

Bush said his office hoped to have a plan by next week to take effect May 1 when the cuts occur. 

The targeted program is called Medically Needy, a $368-million Medicaid option Florida offers for almost 27,000 people who have suffered a catastrophic illness and have exhausted their own medical insurance. 

Bush offered few specifics, such as how much money he wants to put back into the Medically Needy program and where it would come from. He said he hopes to find a way to help people who are in the most need, such as organ transplant recipients and dialysis patients. 

Most of the program's budget is devoted to prescription drugs and hospital stays, with participants simply sending their bills to the state. 

But begining May 1, Medically Needy participants will have to spend all but $450 of their monthly income on their medical care before the state will pick up any part of the tab. 

Participants say $450 will not cover housing, food, utilities and other expenses. 

Liver and marrow transplant recipient Mary Ellen Ross of Delray Beach welcomed word that Bush was looking to restore some of the cuts. 

"We do not want to die," Ross said. 

Ross heads the Florida Transplant Survivors Coalition, an advocacy group that formed in December 2001, when lawmakers first began targeting the Medically Needy program for cuts. Organ transplant recipients must take costly, anti-rejection drugs for the rest of their lives, Ross said. 

The changes in the Medically Needy program were adopted by the Legislature and the governor last year, but were put off until May 1. Some have suggested the delay was politically motivated so the cuts would not become an issue in last year's elections. 

It is becoming increasingly politically charged. 

The Florida Democratic Party plans a news conference Monday to push for full funding of the Medically Needy program. 

A Democrat-sponsored bill (SB1010) would do just that, and the party plans a TV ad campaign to persuade lawmakers to vote for the measure. 

Ross and other Medically Needy participants plan to be in Tallahassee for the news conference. 

Bush said the changes he is considering would be a stopgap measure to help some participants through June 30. What happens after then is unclear. 

Bush has proposed eliminating the program entirely and replacing it with a prescription drug benefit but no hospital benefit. The House and Senate have proposed partial funding but disagree on the amount. The Senate's budget would keep the program but require participants to spend down to the $450 level; the House's budget keeps the program but doesn't require the spend-down. 

State sets up hotline 

Come May 1, people receiving health care under Florida's Medically Needy program must pay a higher percentage of their costs, which many people say they cannot afford. 

To help them find alternate sources of help, the state has set up a toll-free telephone number, 1-888-419-3456. It is a consumer hotline maintained by the Agency for Health Care Administration. The agency will refer people to possible alternatives such as federally funded health care centers, county health departments and drug company programs.

Dear Governor Bush;
 
     I have been told by several legislative members that you read your E-mail, I truly hope this is true.
     As the director of L.A. Social Service Center in Lehigh Acres, I am very concerned about the change in the Medically needy Program.  My clients alone total over 742 in this area of the Lee County and this is only a drop in the bucket of those who use this program.  I know for a fact that most of these clients will not have the money to pay their Share of Cost and therefore they will not have needed live saving medicines.  I have been told my three clients that they would rather kill themselves they to die a slow death without their medicines.  
     No social service agency or church will have the funds to help pay for the medicines, no special programs are out there to assist these individuals with their needs.  
     Please I beg of you don't let this happen, most of those who use this program have no other choice in their medical needs.  If they could afford it they would buy their medicines themselves.  Please consider extending this program and looking in to an alternate means of funding..  I have stated on several occasions to our local representatives how the Medicaid Program is being misused by nursing home patients who are allowed to have spouses with incomes of $14,000.00 yes I am correct it just happened the other day the spouse has $14,000.00 a month income and the husband is on Medicaid for his care.  This is a real misuse of funds and it happened daily just in Lee County.  Please Governor Bush don't let the people who need the Medically Needy Program the most lose out.

The sugar bill would delay for many years the implementation of clean water
standards whereby sugar farmers would limited to 10 ppb of phosphorous,
which bonafide scientists agree is a crucially needed and reasonable
standard. The sugar bill would destroy the urgency of getting growers to
reduce the huge pollution it spews into the Everglades in the form of excess
ph, nitrogen and dirty freshwater sent to tide.

The whole purpose of the $8 billion Everglades Restoration program is to
bring back a semblence of natural normalcy to water flows. Ironically, this
will be the best for Florida economically as well.

Your leadership in killing this industry ploy would I think be perhaps the
most important contribution you make in this session.

Subject: Literacy Coalition Conference in Orlando

TO: THE HONORABLE JEB BUSH Governor, State of Florida     Governor Bush,     I first of all want to thank you for taking time to come to the conference in Orlando. I was inspired by you and, of course, the student being honored.   I am a former teacher of adults and literacy in Orange County, Florida.  I wanted to send you a two-part comment, or suggestion, if you will.     

1.	I taught for several years in the Orange County Jail ('93-'97). When I was teaching there 65 teachers were employed. I witnessed first-hand what a difference an education, specifically the ability to read, can make in a life that has wound up behind bars. My concern here is statewide. Presently in Orange County's jail there are only about 27 teachers and most recently some 14 of those will be laid-off in May. I believe education in the corrections environment is not only noble and worthwhile, but is fiscally sound to our society, teaching them to better themselves and not return to life behind bars. Incarceration is expensive to families, the state, and to society itself. What can we do to preserve this much needed part of our education in Florida? 

2.	I left teaching two years ago when I accepted a position with a book publisher. I now teach educators across the state of Florida about adult education. In 1991, I started with Steck-Vaughn, a division of Harcourt, and had the opportunity to hear you at the Literacy Conference in Tampa. At that conference I had the opportunity to meet Ms. McFadden, of your staff. At that time I mentioned that I was looking for a corporate sponsor to provide a million dollars worth of books to high school and adult programs across the State of Florida. It is still my dream. School systems do not have the budgets to be able to provide books to "give away" to students. Many students desperately need books that they may own. My goal is to provide workbooks to school systems for the purpose of giving them to students to help them toward success. To that end I have come up with a plan to "reprint" a number new titles like Key Historical Documents and Higher Order of Thinking Skills and provide them to both high schools and adult education centers to help students and teachers. In my experience teaching adults, these students are working diligently to improve. The need all the help we can provide. I am searching for a corporate sponsor that would truly be a "POINT OF LIGHT."  I invited Joseph Lee, Chairman/CEO of Darden Restaurants, to attend the luncheon. I have never meet him and he was not available for that day. Such a corporate sponsor could hit an audience of potentially wonderful employees, penetrate a great market of customers with coupons and promos, provide a wonderful service to teachers and students, and receive excellent promotional value for providing such a service.

Dear Governor Bush, 
     I know you are very busy this time of year with the budget; however, I just wanted to express my sincere appreciation for the continued support you and your staff provide for the Healthy Families Florida program. In DeSoto County this has had a major impact in a county of 32,000 folks. We have teamed up the Healthy Families DeSoto Program with Healthy Start to avoid duplication and make wise use of what budget funds we have. I am also a board member of the DeSoto School Readiness Coalition and serve on the DeSoto Coordinating Council for Early Childhood Services. These types of community-based involvements further strengthen the team-work to help stamp out child abuse and neglect activities. You have shown great leadership in the areas of building stronger families, schools and businesses. Thanks for your contribution to the "Florida way of life". I was born and raised (third generation) in Florida and feel very secure in the direction you are taking us. Thanks again for your help with keeping the vision of Healthy Families and Healthy Start alive.

Subject: Marion Co. Superintendent of Schools


Dear Governor Bush:

A recent "Ocala Star Banner" article informed Marion County of Jim Warford's (Superintendent of Schools), resignation to take a position (appointed by you) as Chancellor of Education with the Florida Dept. of Education.  We were further under the impression that you would be appointing Mr. Yancey (Asst. Superintendent) to replace Mr. Warford, thereby finishing out Mr. Warford's elected term.

Although Mr. Warford denied both his resignation and his newly appointed position, as well as having ever referenced either, I am writing this letter on the outside chance that this information might be true.

If you are considering appointing Mr. Yancey as Mr. Warford's replacement,  I would respectfully request reconsideration of this choice, thereby appointing Evelyn Kelly, PhD, instead, for the following reasons:

1.  It is my understanding that Dr. Kelly had been the choice of the Republican voting electorate, when she ran against Mr. Yancey in 1992 (she won with 60% of the vote).  While she did lose the General Election, it was with by an extremely close margin (200 votes). She was clearly the Republican choice, and nearly the Democrat choice as well.
2.  Her educational background and experience within the academic world are amazing, and her credentials are impeccable.  Through her years of leadership within a volunteer capacity, she also has gained experience within the business and  organizational areas.
3.  On the other hand, Republicans remember when Mr. Yancy, after losing the Primary, through his support behind Democrats in an ad in the Star Banner.  This did not set well with Republicans, and as a result, would highly diminish any chances he would have to be elected to this office upon completion of this term.

Please appoint Dr. Evelyn Kelly to the position of Marion County Superintendent of Schools.

Sincerely,

Sandi Trusso
Ocala, FL

Mr. Newman:

This is in response to your emails of April 17 and April 21, 2003 regarding
the I-95 and I-195 lighting systems in Miami-Dade County.

During  the period from March 4, 2003 to April 18, 2003 there were nine (9)
separate  repairs  to  the  lighting  system  that occurred during daylight
hours.    The  load  centers  subject to diagnostic and circuit repair work
were located between NW 135 street and Golden Glades Interchange.

We  do  test  the  system  to  ensure  repairs  are  properly completed  by
establishing  a  24  hour  burn-in   period.  Lights are only on during the
daytime  if  repairs are underway or repairs are being tested. The lighting
systems are surveyed at night to inventory burnout lights or circuits.

For  your information, the Miami-Dade Office of the DOT privatized lighting
maintenance  over  four  (4) years ago. This contract is performance based,
and  has  improved the operational level, (per cent of lights on at night),
to 99.66% on I-95 and 99.87% on the remainder of the limited access system.

I  feel  that continued diagnostic, routine repairs and testing of circuits
is the key to higher performance in the long run.

I trust that this will clarify why the lights may be on during the daytime.
We appreciate your interest and concerns

Dear Governor:

We need your help.

The Arts funding in the State looks like is going to be eliminated. IN
FLORIDA THE ARTS ARE A $ 1,4 BILLION INDUSTRY.

 I think the small amount of dollars that the State dedicates to promote
non- for profit cultural groups is so small that  eliminating it is not
going to solve any of the other big problems. On the other hand is going to
create a lot of suffering and is going to send a very wrong message. We are
going backwards!

There are more than 100  non- for profit cultural groups in Dade County
that receive money from the State. With the economy down and the uncertanty
they are more than ever in need for State support.

All these groups have Boards of Directors and big audiences. They represent
a big constituency. They create jobs.  ( more than 22,000 in the whole
State ).

Our heritage as a community and as a country is what makes us a great
people and a great nation. Our cultural groups and artists work to preserve
and advance our ideas and our traditions, and in so doing,they help
preserve and enrich the soul of our society.

It is our duty to support our cultural organizations, now more than ever -
now that our freedoms, our diversity, the dynamism of our society and the
vibrancy of our culture are the envy of our friends and the target of our
enemies. IT IS OUR DUTY, PERHAPS OUR PRIVILEGE, TO GIVE OUR UTMOST SUPPORT
TO THE CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS THAT PROTECT THAT FREEDOM, CHANNEL OUR
DYNAMISM, DEMOSTRATE THAT VIBRANCY AND, IN THE PROCESS, ENRICH OUR LIVES.

Dear Governor , we really need your help, your leadership.........don't let
this happen......

Dear Governor Bush,
If the St. Joe airport were cancelled- how much more state tax $ would be available to education, culture,  environment, & health services for Floridians?  What's more important - using Floridian's tax dollars to subsidize developers and special interests or to protect the welfare of Floridians who foot the bill? Think about it.

St. Pete Times
Bush seen as booster for big, unpopular airport



Opposition runs strong to plans for the new Panhandle airport even as Gov. Jeb Bush leads a summit today on the future development around the proposed project. 



By CRAIG PITTMAN, Times Staff Writer 
© St. Petersburg Times
published April 21, 2003 
Plans to build a new Panhandle airport larger than Tampa's on property owned by the state's largest private landowner have encountered serious public opposition. 
Critics of the proposed new airport, to be built on land owned by The St. Joe Co. north of Panama City, have collected enough petition signatures to hold a referendum. But city officials refused last month to schedule the election for this Tuesday, leading to talk of a court battle. 
To counter the opposition, airport supporters have brought in a big gun: Gov. Jeb Bush. 
Much to the consternation of airport opponents, Bush has invited 500 people in Bay County to join him today in an unusual economic summit focused on what should happen with St. Joe's property. 
But participants won't be asked whether the new airport should be built or whether taxpayers should foot the bill for the $210-million project. 
Instead, they will be asked what new businesses and jobs they want to see as part of the new development St. Joe is planning for the 70,000 acres it owns around the airport. 
"This is an opportunity for the governor to set the tone about what happens in the area," said program moderator Pamella Dana, director of the state's Office of Tourism, Trade and Economic Development. "There are a lot of development opportunities in the region." 
That doesn't sit well with airport opponents such as Arthur Stewart, a retired air traffic controller who helped round up 2,700 petition signatures calling for a referendum. 
"It would've been more appropriate if the governor had taken an arm's length view on this and left it to be decided by the voters," Stewart said. 
He did take some comfort from Bush's involvement. 
"If they have to bring the governor over here to sell this program, then they're in serious trouble," Stewart said. 
More troubling was word that only the people with invitations would be allowed in, said Panama City surgeon Greg Bruce, a private pilot who also has been a leader in opposing the new airport project. Bruce said he and other critics of the new airport were not invited, but some of them plan to try to get in the door anyway. 
After all, Bruce pointed out, look how many people on the public payroll will be there. Bush will be bringing along state Rep. Allan Bense, R-Panama City, Secretary of State Glenda Hood and Department of Community Affairs chief Colleen Castille. 
A spokeswoman for Gulf Coast Community College told The (Panama City) News Herald that opponents are not welcome. 
"We will provide a place for individuals to protest if they want to, but it won't be inside the student center," college spokeswoman Carole Lapensohn said. "No one will be allowed to protest in the student center." 
But Dana said critics are welcome as well as supporters. And she said Bush and other state officials are not going to Panama City to shore up support for St. Joe's development plans, which hinge on winning government approval to build a new airport on 4,000 acres of pine plantation next door to Florida's oldest state forest. 
"The governor is not putting in a plug for anything," said Dana, who described herself as Bush's chief economic adviser. She said she was unaware of the proposed referendum on moving the airport. 
In the letter inviting people to attend the summit, the governor referred only to the positive aspects of the airport and the "sector plan," which lays out the development of the land around it. 
"With the completion of the West Bay Sector Plan and proposed relocation of the airport, there exists a tremendous opportunity for Bay County to lead as an economic powerhouse," Bush wrote. "To ensure that such growth is planned and embraced by all, the community's input on this issue is more important now than ever." 
Dana said Bush is attending "as a courtesy" to a Panhandle economic development organization called Florida's Great Northwest Inc., which is designed to attract new businesses to the 16-county region. 
Florida's Great Northwest Inc. was founded in 2000 as the brainchild of a St. Joe vice president. St. Joe remains one of its three major financial backers, and a St. Joe executive helps oversee its daily operations. The name comes from the slogan that St. Joe executives want to see replace the more traditional "Panhandle" in describing the region. 
Spokesmen for The St. Joe Co. and Florida's Great Northwest Inc. could not be reached for comment Friday. However, St. Joe Co. chairman Peter Rummell, who has called the new airport "essential to unlocking the enormous value of our holdings," is among those expected to attend. 
St. Joe, once a stodgy timber and paper company, has transformed itself into the state's most ambitious developer. The company owns about 1-million acres, and has launched more than 20 developments so far, setting off the most sweeping change to the Florida landscape since Walt Disney turned a swamp into the Magic Kingdom. 
On land that until now has been in the middle of nowhere, St. Joe is building homes and hotels, hospitals and schools, golf courses and shopping centers, theaters and restaurants, offices and industrial parks. 
The company enjoys tremendous political clout. Rummell, a major contributor to the GOP, has personally lobbied the governor to get taxpayer dollars to pay for the new airport. Among the company's lobbyists is House Speaker Johnnie Byrd's best friend. And the attorney shepherding St. Joe's development plans in Bay County, William Harrison, co-chaired the Bush presidential campaign in the Panhandle. 
The new airport would provide services to Panama City, 20 miles to the southwest, replacing Panama City's current airport. The Panama City-Bay County Airport, which sits inside the city limits, gets so little traffic now that the control tower shuts down at 10 p.m.

Subject:	Fw: Central Sarasota Parkway/I-75 Interchange

 
Dear Governor:
 
This project is not needed and has risen to consideration because of the benefit of one such developer, Palmer Ranch Holdings.  The interchange issue that is surfacing now is feeding off of a related issue of commercial development, which because of such local opposition, was deferred in a hearing by our county Commissioners.  That' correct, the same people behind the same issue.
 
This usually doesn't happen and everybody knows it's for the avarice of the developer.  They are pushing for this extension and interchange off of I-75 to be built as a supply line for their own selfish purposes:  commercial development that would benefit just them.  The people have spoken as to what's best for them, and what they need.
 
We have an over 90% disapproval of such intrusion via a petition.  The public announcement is that we need "traffic abatement" for Clark road, and another hurricane evacuation route.  This is not true.  Clark road is far from approaching maximun traffic numbers.    And if another hurricane route is needed, a more central location is turning 681 into an all direction north/south access.  It would be cheaper, it's central, and it 
 
Please do what you can to put the brakes on the Central Sarasota Extension and I-75 Interchange.  That money will be better spent somewhere else.

If this message from you was an implied threat to me, I will tell you that there is very little at my age that can intimidate me. Having had an alcoholic father and a mother that was absent a lot of my growing years I worked very hard since I was 15 years of age for what little I have as opposed to some who have been born into luxury. I am now volunteering my time to help people in less fortunate circumstances than myself in addition to having a mentally handicapped son and being a caregiver for my terminally ill wife. 

My original message was to convey to you and the other elected officials that I think it is grossly unfair for them to vote themselves a raise when social security reciptients got a 1.4% increase on their small earnings.  My opening message "about crooked politicians" was meant to those who are guility of being such. If the shoe fits_____?

Dear Governor Bush:
 
We were informed that the meals program for the elderly offered by the Southwest Social Services Program, Inc., is in jeopardy and might be discontinued due to funding cuts by the State of Florida.
 
By means of this e-mail I would like to request for you to please re-consider a decision to terminate this service.  
 
My mother, who is 88 years old, is able to eat a warm lunch every day thanks to this service.  I need to work outside the home in order to provide for my family, thus am unable to take care of my mothers cooking needs during the day.  
 
Southwest Social Services Program, Inc. delivers to her front door a hot, nutritive lunch every day and we are more than thankful for that service.
 
I do not know what the cost for operating this important service is, but I assume that it is probably not a large amount when compared to other services offered by the State of Florida.
 
This meals service is one of the basic services that could be offered to the elderly, who are unable to go a store, shop, and cook their meals.  Without this service, some of my moms elderly friends, would be unable to eat everyday, mainly due to not have the money to purchase groceries nor any other prepared food.
 
Please re-consider the State of Florida decision,

Governor:

 

I need about fifteen minutes of your time to discuss the Streamlined Sales Tax Project.  Our ox is in the ditch in the House and I want to talk to you about our efforts and how I think you can help.  I know that you do not want to be out front on the issue and I would not ask that, but if we don’t do something quickly we will miss this opportunity to modernize Florida’s sales and use tax system.  You and I both know that this is a sea change in retailing and if Florida is to continue to rely on sales tax it must act.

 

Please give me some time this week.  Thanks.

Governor Bush,
 
I would like to express my strong support for your proposal to increase Healthy Families' funding by 12 million dollars so that we prevent thousands of children and families from ending up in the system.  It will cost all Floridians much more money if these families have to be referred to other programs within the state.
 
There is no doubt that Healthy Families works.  The latest results from an independent evaluator show that Healthy Families is working to prevent abuse - 98% percent of the children served had no child maltreatment within 12 months after the family completed the program.
 
As a citizen and resident of Miami-Dade County, I applaud your commitment to the children and families in our community that are the most needy and desperately rely on the services that Healthy Families provide.
 
Best Regards,
Emilio Vento, M.S.Ed., DAPA

Governor:

It was a pleasure being with you on the mission to Spain in February.  Your
representation of our state and country could not have been better. I hope
positive follow up occurs that will lead new trade relationships.  The
Spanish have an inbound corporate mission in two weeks that would indicate
the beginnings of progress.  I have several thoughts on the Spanish-Florida
relationship but that is not the purpose of this email.

I am writing to ask your support by endorsement letter for a Federal
Technology Opportunities Program (TOP's) grant .  I believe the project is
one of which you have shown strong interest and may possible be exciting to
you.  I will try to be brief but this is truly a complicated subject.

Seminole County Government and the University of Central Florida are
entering into a collaborative effort to build an Integrated Government
System Service (IGSS).  It is major advancement of GIS- using "drill down
technology" or sometimes called ".net technology".  The project will use
allow the citizen to use one online service platform to access all
available government resource data requiring a query.  It will eliminate
multiple static pages and the link concept.  The links related to the query
become seamless.  IGSS has been done by governments to a limited degree,
however not the scale this project contemplates.  Currently, advanced
government projects when having multiple sources will either force a user
to jump to link or will build a whole new data base containing the
information from the various sources.  The problem is developing new
combined data bases is very costly and when dealing multiple departments or
agencies how do you assure updated information in your combined data base.
What is needed is a seamless drill down technology applied to all these
sources. It is called integrated live links.  Imagine a property owner
being able to access the system and have every local and state government
data base- from schools- to public safety- to DOT- to medical services -
property /court records- to zoning (you get idea)-- all accessible though
one service platform.  The applications are almost endless.

No government in the United States has implemented a system such as we are
designing.

Seminole County currently has a model GIS system and is in fact the host
system for our Central Florida region.  The University of Central Florida
Engineering Department is a national leader in "drill down technology" used
in a IGSS.  The work by the University with the Department of Navy's
missile guidance systems, cold fusion technologies and procurement
techniques makes for a perfect partnership.  Seminole County with the
commitment and a manageable sized GIS and UCF with the experience.
Implementing the IGSS is monetarily expensive and time consuming.  The
project is in two phases and will take approx. 18-24 months to complete.
Upon successful implementation we will make IGSS system available to all
governments and agencies interested in Florida.

To offset a portion of the costs we are seeking a Federal TOP's grant.
Last year of the hundreds of TOP's grant received only a small portion were
funded.  Would you be willing to sign an endorsement letter next week we
can include in the application package?  We can draft it and have it in
your office Monday. We are on a short time line.

If you have any questions please feel to call me. Thanks for your
consideration.

I hope you have or have had a happy and relaxing Easter.

Best personal regards,

Randy Morris
Seminole County Commissioner

On May 6, the Denver voters will up or down initiative 100 to help support developmental disability issues. They hope to generate nearly $7 million annually. This is just for the city. You could direct one of your staffers to investigate it. The contact number is 303-753-6688 or www.denveroptions.org.
 
The cost to the individual home owner of properties valued at $220,000 to fund the community initiative is about $15 a year. 
 
If put to the people, they would reasonably support something at $0.25- $0.50 a person per year to help make our most vulnerable citizens more independent because the people are moral, just, and care.

Dear Governor:
 
Thank you for your thoughtful response to the DRI in Sarasota county on the Palmer Ranch.  Mr. Cook, who represents Palmer Ranch Holdings, can't appeal and manipulate people in power when the local residents know what's right for them.
 
The development of up to 99 acres internally as well as the intrusion into the Palmer Ranch disturbs this well crafted blend of nature and residential living.  The master plan does state that up to 99 acres of development is possible and another I-75 Interchange may be desired "to serve the needs of those in Palmer Ranch."  The people of Palmer Ranch have spoken with an over 90% disapproval via a petition.   We don't want it.  
 
No developer is objective enough to tell us what's right for us; to tell us what we need.  That's the slight of hand that's going on here.
 
So Governor, I realize you have deferred this to a local level.  But we will appeal to your power when justice needs to temper the avarice of a developer.
 
Your Kind Servant,
 
Scott Chandler

Per our inquiry to the Gov's email, the website referenced in the complaint
is no longer posted.  We could not access it and it no longer exists.  The
registration for who owned it when it was active comes back to someone in
the United Arab Emirates.  There is little we can do about spam of this
nature.  The victim could block the address using a filter so that no mail
from that person could come into his or her inbox...but this is usually of
little value since the spammers rarely use the same address more than once
to send out their spam.  Based on our initial finding, unless directed by

Dear Governor Bush:

As you may be aware, I and my firms have represented Florida Housing Finance
Corporation, and its predecessor ("Florida Housing"), off and on since 1987,
initially under Governor Martinez's administration.  We have closed more
than $1 billion in single family homeownership and multifamily apartment
rental transactions for Florida Housing.
The State of Florida is one of the most progressive states in providing
affordable housing to its residents.  One of the more innovative means of
establishing financing for such programs was the enactment of the Sadowski
legislation.  The Sadowski legislation created the State and the Local
Government Housing Trust Funds, the State Apartment Incentive Loan ("SAIL")
program at the State level and the State Housing Initiatives Partnership
("SHIP") program at the city and county level.  By law, the cities and
counties must spend 65% of their SHIP funds for homeownership for eligible
families designated as 'very low income,' 'low income' or 'moderate income'.
The priorities must be set locally pursuant to the city's or county's local
housing assistance plan.
The SAIL program focuses on rental housing, including housing for such
difficult to serve Floridians as farm-workers, commercial fishing workers
and the homeless.  Developers who seek to use the SAIL program are scored
based on their commitment to serve such groups and to reserve apartment
units to families earning less than 50% of median income.  The SAIL program
is often coupled with a taxable or tax credit financing program to insure an
adequate financial base for the development of an affordable housing
development.  In many instances the proposed affordable housing transaction
could not be accomplished without the SAIL program component.  
It has been our experience that these programs, together with the bond
programs and low income housing tax credit programs, have improved inner
city housing in Florida.  In addition, the successful implementation of
these programs has generated thousands of jobs for Floridians in the
building trades.  While I and most Floridians recognize that this year's
state budget calls for sacrifice, I would urge that we retain the State and
Local Government Housing Trust Funds so that they can continue their unique
contribution to the State of Florida and to those residents of the State of
Florida in need of housing.

   Jeb,
       I have not written in quite a long time. I've been busy putting back together the pieces of my life since my divorce. The ex-husband has remarried already - his mistress. It has been a painful time. Where I'd be without my true friends and of course, Jesus Christ, is beyond my ability to comprehend.
       I suspect ( actually, "know", now) that there were a few "friends" in Tallhassee that helped to "dismiss" the allegations against my former husband back in 1999-2000. I am thankful, even though I now realize the allegations were valid after reading the investigative report and actually speaking to the former student myself. I also had to put together the history that had indeed continued to repeat itself.
       Anyway, as far as the forwarded email below - WHY, at a time when educational funds are in a highly-publicized crisis would this resurrected "residential school" in Brevard even be considered?
       You vetoed this residential school before, and I ask you to do the same now, IF it gets through the legislature again- PLEASE VETO this incredible foolishness.
        I am losing faith in our Republican representatives to think clearly! Now to memorialize our fallen astronauts they attach "Columbia" to an elitist school that will cost $20,000+ FTE per year? Good grief!
        Please read the comments of a local education activist (Republican) below.
        Thanks. It would be nice to hear from you again.

A rather personal letter in the Stuart News, don't you think?  I have disagreed 
with Audubon on a few things in the past, but have never written letters that 
question your personal commitment or competency.   I think I deserve better.

I am confused because you appear to me to vacillate between "fighting" and 
"writing."  Every amendment you have asked for has  been, or will soon be, 
made to the bill that eventually passes the legislature.  Maybe you don't like the 
process -- either do I  sometimes -- but we don't control it, we manage within it, 
and are getting very good results.

Finally, why do you not think we are talking to relevant federal officials?  As 
recently as this morning Governor Bush and I met with EPA...again.  I personally 
am in regular communication with them.

No need to respond; I will see you around the capitol.

Subject:	Re: Online Assessment Pilot (Proviso Language)

Dear Governor Bush:

No specific amount has been noted in this line item as it is our 
understanding that it would be best to leave that up to the discretion of the 
districts... we see the proviso language as a way to implement the Blue 
Ribbon Task Force Recommendation in a very moderate fashion.  The pilot would 
simply be the proving ground to lay the foundation for the future savings 
that can be experienced. The language includes a "reporting" mechanism 
thereby demonstrating to those districts that have not participated in the 
pilot, the outcomes they too can anticipate with broader implementation of a 
Web-based Program.  

Governor Bush, I am aware that $4.5-million had been allocated to the 
districts from IDEA dollars to assist in the remediation of the class of 
2003.  To date, I am unaware of the dollars that have or have not been 
utilized from this allocation of funds.  The Department should be able to 
assist in the identification of a funding mechanism.   

Your assistance can hopefully generate the needed support to move the pilot 
forward. As you are well aware, the savings component should certainly be 
enough motivation for the districts to participate and a number of districts 
have already requested information pertaining to their participation in such 
a pilot.  Your support is CRUCIAL! Thank you

I wanted to thank you for the great support you have provided on the 
Apalachicola River work -- especially the past several days.  I think we had the 
right facts, the right questions, and the right tone today....and you all helped 
make that possible.

Of course,  I heard the Governor on the radio on my drive home talking about 
Florida's kids getting the cold shower...  Made our point very plainly.  Thanks.

There is, of course, an important difference:  In times of extreme shortages 
(drought) the first kids in the shower are not proposing to use a little less water 
than normal (shared adversity); they are actually proposing to use substantially 
more hot water.

In fact, the proposals on the table actually create an incentive for those who are 
first in line to consume rather than conserve.  That's because once the water 
heater (reservoir) is emptied beyond a certain point the obligation to provide hot 
showers for those last in line goes away.
--------
We are writing up some language for GA and AL regarding not holding any 
party responsible for "Acts of God" (i.e., if everyone is abiding by the allocation 
formula and the water just isn't available, no one is in legal jeopardy).

We are expecting to receive the new data later this week from GA regarding the 
substantial difference over the number of irrigated acres and the dry year 
multiplier.  They are using a combination of satellite imagery and on-the-ground 
interviews.  We have been trying to get this unpublished data for awhile, so are 
pleased we will now have it to better understand their position.

Harold made it clear this afternoon he does not have the authority to agree to 
incorporating any conservation measures into a water allocation formula for 
Georgia.  We are going to go ahead a prepare some model runs that plug in 
some minimal conservation values for Georgia to see what effect it has on 
closing the existing gap.  We will not presume to prescribe what those 
conservation strategies should be.

Given where we are in the process, I will provide you regular updates on our 
progress.  We will want to do some of this in person.

thanks again,

David

Dear Governor Bush,

Thank you for taking the time to reply to my concerns.

You asked in your email, "What is the solution to avoid bankruptcy that will create such hardship for families associated with American Airlines?"

In all honesty, Governor Bush, I am not qualified to answer this question with an educated, financial response.  Simply put, I am a mother of two young girls, and wife of a 757/767 pilot currently employed at American Airlines.  My knowledge base is such that I have actively read and listened to analysts' proposals & opinions about the pros and cons regarding filing a Chapter 11 at AA.  Much of what I've come to learn about the aspects of this Tentative Agreement, I've learned from listening to the discussions my husband has had with his friends, and coworkers. 

It is no secret that AA is bleeding money.  The company cannot continue to exist in its current model.  Costs must be reduced or eliminated. All of this is understandable and acceptable.

What is unacceptable, is the permissive culture which has been embedded in corporate America for much too long, and although I am but one person, dog-gone-it, I just can't go to sleep another night without attempting to find someone who will listen, and hopefully, have on his or her person, a bullhorn!  No longer is there a moral decency to anything.  And for me, this day, I'm giving it my best shot.

I'm a "spirit of the law" kind of person.  I don't like loopholes or technicalities.  I believe in fairness, but not necessarily in equality.

So, when American Airlines proposed to (scammed) its three unions the current TA, I immediately felt disgusted with what was pushed upon us.  Beginning with the fact that:
1)  Didn't AA management see this beast coming?
     a.)  we know they did...we all did...
2)  Why wasn't there a plan in place months ago?
     a.)  we wrongly assumed that those being highly compensated (to say the least) among the corporate "heads" were diligently working on it.

In the days leading up to the last day to vote, the APA membership became concerned, that due to several aspects of the TA still being ironed out, there had yet to be a final, written agreement available for employee inspection.  Due to lack of reasoning within the union leadership & AA managers, several pilots felt it necessary to appeal before a judge for an injunction to halt the voting process until the contractual language was finalized, but the judge denied the request in the last day or two before the votes were to be counted.

Growing in helplessness, I watched as the Flight Attendants' union was granted an extra day to vote simply because the final tabulation of votes denied their TA.

Then...the largest blow to fairness came when the 30-40 management bonuses and bankruptcy-protected pensions were revealed in the AA SEC filing dated April 15, 2003.  Had most of the employees seen the large chunks of pie the CEO and his upper team members had allocated for themselves, in such dire company times, many union members have stated they'd have never voted to accept something so unfair, had they known all the facts.

The bottom line is that AA has been untruthful and unfair to its employees.  Managers have used their positions to reward themselves, while thousands of jobs were on the line.  

I think it's time that someone calls for some new leadership and guidance at AA.  This is not just a company, but a collection of mothers and fathers and regular people wanting a job with honest pay.  These are decent people working in a service industry who could use a break.  We need outsiders to come up with a fair plan for cost-cutting.  We don't trust the leadership at the helm anymore.  They are driving this ship into a storm, with their liferafts fully inflated and ready for departure.

Rats.  I apologize for this having been so long.  I've been working on this now for almost three hours, trying to condense my thoughts for you.  You are a *wonderful* Governor, by the way, and I pray for you, Columba, your children, your parents (whom I've especially adored since high school, and have held as personal role models in so many ways throughout the years)...and of course, your brother, the President (& my husband's Commander in Chief...Paul is a LtCol, USMC Reserves) & Laura, who is God-sent to this Nation, for these times.  You are a family of love and prayer, and sense, and fairness.  I have never for a second thought your family was here by chance, and I don't believe any one of you does, either.  It gives me such comfort knowing that you deeply care for the people you serve.

Well, sir, if you've read this far, again I thank you.  

Please accept my apologies once again for grammatical errors, and the like.  I need to get to bed (SAHMom), and want to send this off to you tonight.

God bless you for your sacrifices!

Dear Governor Bush,

Thank you for coming to MetLife during your recent visit to New York City.
We appreciated your taking the time, and your offer to support our efforts
to preserve our eligibility for the insurer salary tax credit, even though
we have formed a service company subsidiary and transferred our 1,858
Florida employees (and $67 million annual payroll) to that company.

Unfortunately, it appears that we have encountered a potential problem.
Sen. Pruitt has indicated he intends to remove the provision (due to the
revenue impact) when the bill is considered in the Appropriations Committee
tomorrow (Tuesday) afternoon.  If you might have the opportunity to contact
Sen. King and ask him to encourage Sen. Pruitt to retain this provision,
that would be extremely helpful and greatly appreciated.

If you or any members of your staff would like to discuss this further or
would like more information, please feel free to contact me at this e-mail
address, or at 973/275-1998.

Thank you very much for your help.

Sincerely,

Governor Bush -
 
Moody's downgraded TECO yesterday due to perceived risks associated with out of state investments.
 
The company is disappointed, but prepared to move forward.
 
The operations of Tampa Electric and Peoples Gas in Florida are unaffected, and there is no risk to customers.
 
Officers of the company are briefing the PSC today.

      Dear Jeb,
 
 
       I highly doubt you remember me, but I wrote you a long time ago back when my e-mail was singerboy. I told you I wanted to be a book writer, well now I have finished the two books I started, and am writting new one. Some time if you want I will tell you about one of them, but right now I must go soon, so I cant stay on long. My name is Mike Austin Dorsey But some people call me M.A.D. :] I also wanted to say, I dont thing we would have gotton far into this war if your brother was not the president, I think he has made some really good choices, and ( not to be mean ) but I thank God that Bill isn't still our president during this time of hour.
             I was at the Natioanl day of prayer last year, I lead us into the Pledge of Alechints ( I dont really know how to spell that ) But I'm honner to say that I will be doing it again this year. I Was also honnered to find that I was asked to be one of the four boyscouts who will be doing it as well, and I beleive we will be sitting right in front of you! So I guess I will see you there. I'm sorry, I pushed a button that somehow made the spelling chang! But I dont know how to fix it!!!!!   <http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/06.gif>   Anyway, I was also honnered when you wrote me back last time, I didn't really think you would, since I imagn your bussy. Anyway, I'll let you go, it was nice writting you again, tell your brother  that Micheal Austin Dorsey say's hi!
 
      God Bless you and your Family!!!

Dear Governor Bush,
I wanted to thank you for easing my mind about releasing my nephews portrait. 
The first visit's I made was to obtain the blessings of the Chaplain of the 
33rd fighter wing and then to ask the advice of the Director of the Eglin 
Armament Museum.  At the very time the statue fell in Baghdad, I was praying 
with the Chaplain for our troops.  Ironic... As always the Angels are guiding 
me and now have led me to the National Air Force Museum where we learned that 
we indeed have a true national historic treasure.  As the Armament Museum 
Director suggested, we are taking steps to guarantee it is kept safe for 
future generations to see and learn about. He also suggested sharing it with 
educators and offering to show it at schools. Therefore it is very important 
to us to ensure the story behind it is rooted in a good foundation before we 
share it with America. We are glad to be working with the National Museum to 
assure this beginning.  I would not have attempted to do this without your 
Blessings.  Thank you again Sir. You really did help me to take the next step.
Sincerely,   
Dari Bradley

Good Morning Governor!
    Thank you SO much for the kind recommendation you wrote for Heather to the Biomedical Engineering Internship in Washington. I have great news! She was chosen! She'll be one of sixteen kids from all over the nation who will be mentored by world-class scientists in cutting edge technology at the National Institute of Health this summer. Apparently there were hundreds of applications, so I'm sure your recommendation helped to make this possible for her. We just can't thank you enough. She is THRILLED and we are so excited for her.
    Bill and I would like to ask for a moment of your time by phone so we could discuss an invitation with you. We'd like to run the idea past you and get your advice before we put the details into writing. Would it be possible for you to call me sometime in the next few days so I could tell you what we're thinking? I'll list my numbers below in order to make calling as convenient as possible for you. If a personal call is not possible, please let me know by e-mail and I'll try to put all the questions into writing. We certainly understand your busy schedule and don't want to impose. Have a great day and thanks again for your kindness.
 
Sincerely, Bill and Nancy Brant

Since I have sent this letter I have been contacted by the office of Mental Health Svcs, which I greatly appreciate. However, Inmate Driggers has since been re-classified as "Close" custody after his release from confinement on 04-21-03. I do not understand the reason for this re-classification,as he was put in confinement in the first place because I reported his situation and it was dicovered that he gave another inmate his pin number to call  me. He was given a DR for that, and for lying to staff about it, he also lost his earned gain time. Is this cause to be considered "Close Custody"? Has Central Classification in Talahassee approved this ? I realize he has had DR's, But nothing violent, nothing that poses a threat to the safety of the staff or inmates. He has been "Medium" custody for 18 months.I would also like to request a copy of the report from the Inspector General's office who determined that his allegations were false because in our taped phone conversations we frequently discussed our desire for him to be transferred closer to home. Also, I originally inquired of Mrs. Darlene Lumpkin (Central Classification) the reason for his transfer, and was told he was transfered to Gulf from Madison to participate in the "Mandatory Literacy Program" ,which he still has heard nothing about after 2 months of being at Gulf CI.I greatly appreciate any assistance I can get from any pf you departments. I realize the amount of mail you must receive and the incredible burdens that must fall on the shoulders of those who work for the Department of Corrections. Inmate Driggers is just one person out of 70,000 plus Imates, but his safety while Incarcerated and his desire to pay for his crimes and return home a better person to take care of his wife and kids are of the utmost importance to me and our children (ages 6 & 18 months).

Rebecca,
  Thank you for your very kind  reply.  Habitat and animal issues are very dear to me and it tears at my heart every time I see more land being destroyed for yet another housing or other development. When my dog was much younger, I use to take her out to cleared construction site to let her run, and I clearly remember seeing the large birds of prey that would sit atop the piles of rubble having been displaced from their homes, or the other animals that would come thru the underbrush to find them selves in unfamiliar surroundings.  The sad part is that is just the ones you see and the ones that are still alive and much of the wonderful woodlands that were in Central Florida are either gone or rapidly being destroyed.  
 
I know I am not alone in these observations, and it is so good to know that you, and people like you care enough and band together to try to save  what little we have left.  I hope you know that your work and dedication is appreciated by many and I thank you for all the effort you have put into this.  I sincerely hope you are successful in saving the natural habitat at UCF and other places around  Florida or even the country.  Please let me know how things are going or if there is more I can do to help.  
 
Thanks,
Lori
 
P.S  Know of anyone who is organizing against pet stores that abuse/ neglect/ or otherwise mistreat reptiles or other animals, and to 
       require them to provide detailed, and correct care instructions to all customers who buy exotics?    I have had a long time desire  
      to try to change some things in that area as I have seen horrible atrocities in many of the local pet stores in the last few years.

 I just received your petitions and I want to say how MUCH I appreciate your personal commentary, which so well summarizes the land use struggles---and that between human overpopulation and the survival of our beloved native species---that lie ahead.  This strong philosophical commitment by yourself, myself, and others, to be kind to habitats that house living things unable to speak for themselves, WILL make a difference over time---and I have real optimism that it will make a difference in this particular instance at UCF:  we'll see.
 
THANK THANK YOU for taking the time to voice your quite valid, well-reasoned opinion in defense of our gopher tortoises, other animals & plants, and their highly evolved and interelated little "worlds".
 
A very Happy Easter to you,

Hey, Lori!  Thanks for expressing interest in helping saving the beautiful UCF forest in the NW quadrant of campus.  I will send you, as an attachment, my petition, and the explanation of it, and you can print out and sign and send to me, hopefully with some of your own personal comments---which can be general, if you want, about loss of habitat in Central Florida, or specific to whatever degree you wish to go.  The DCA has informed me that they are to undergo "informal talks" with UCF about their plan, soon, and will keep me apprised of upcoming meeting dates.  I want to present them with AS MUCH voiced opposition to their plan as possible, so your signed petition and/or comments will be very helpful.   If the forum permits full public participation, you might could attend too.
 
The whole problem with the Master Plan is that UCF snuck it past the public, so very few people even KNOW what it entails.  The media never has covered it, even thought there are many flaws in their procedure and genuine environmental devastating impact if the Plan goes forward in its current form.
 
So I will send you the petition, and if you have any questions or further input, just let me know.
 
Again, THANKS for taking the time to write!
 
Best Regards,
 
Rebecca Eagan

Thank you for the service you provide to the citizens of Florida. I agree with most  of the basic tenets of your message and commend you for them. In fact, that is why I, as well as other school superintendent’s, stood in opposition to the constitutional amendment regarding the class size initiative. We took a stance in support of the Governor’s position on the amendment which became an extremely volatile, well advertised, much debated topic throughout the recent election.
However, in spite of the cost,  the majority of a well informed public voted to initiate the expensive Class Size Amendment while showing overwhelming support  for Governor Bush and his conservative principles. It seems to me, we have been charged by the people to implement this amendment- by the same people who have entrusted us to lead through these difficult times.  Many legislators were re-elected or initially elected due to the popularity of Governor Bush. I encourage you, and other members of the House, to follow the pragmatic, effective leadership of Governor Bush and that of a realistic Senate in dealing with the issues affecting education. The Governor/Senate budget is lean, the house budget is anorexic.  Please consider these factors as you deal with the difficult issues before you. Thank you.

Dear Gov. Bush:
	You are taking our Superintendent of Schools, Jim Warford, to do a bigger
job within the State Department of Education, and we now have a major
vacancy.  I urge you to appoint Deputy Superintendent of Schools Jim Yancey
to fill this position and to do it quickly.
	As someone involved in many controversies in our community as a newsperman,
and as a political activitist, I have known the Yancey family for about 40
years; sometimes I have been on the same side with Jim and/or his family, at
other times, I may have opposed them. From his days as a football player at
U of F, to his first jobs in Marion County in coaching, and then as Dean of
Students at Vanguard High School, and on through his many other assignments
including principal ships at Dunnellon and Belleview, he has strived for
excellence from his players, his students and his teachers.  He has worked
in both public and private schools, is a strong supporter of change to bring
educational excellence.
	His students have excelled as they have been provided opportunities under
his coaching and principal ships. 	His teachers have excelled as they have
been provided guidance, leadership, opportunities and the freedom to do what
we hired them to do -- teach! His support at various schools is legend. His
loyalty has been valued by Jim Warford. In fact, without Jim Yancey, Jim
Warford's programs would not have been successful in their implementation.
	The only thing more important than education to Jim Yancey is his family.
	I am aware that a small group of Republicans has mounted a campaign for
another person, a retiree who lost to a Democrat in the election of 1992.
While this group may be noisy, it is my judgment they neither represent a
majority of Republicans or of patrons of the school system. An appointment
of Jim Yancey will be very well received in Marion County.
	I do not write letters of recommendation lightly or frequently.  I urge you
to name Jim Yancey to this important position. He will make you, Marion
County and all of Florida proud as he continues the programs that will bring
a better education to all of our students. I recommend him without
hesitation!
	Sincerely,

Dear Gov Jeb Bush,

Hi, my name is Wendi Showalter.  I live in St Petersburg, Pinellas 
County.  We are starting the new
school Choice Program.  I feel this program has several problems:  

I've been trying to get paper work for the Florida Pride Program but it 
will not be available until
May.  One of the Private schools stated that the program was so late due 
to the legislation.   I am
a single mother with a low income trying to give my daughter a better 
education.   So with the possibility of not getting a scholarship I 
picked school from the Choice Plan.

My daughter Shelbie is a first grader.   The school she is going to this 
year is not meeting our needs.
So with the Choice Plan I thought we would be able to choose a school 
that would work for us.   I
turned in all the paper work in on time and did what I was suppose to.   
My nephew Tyler is staying
with me and did the same Choice Plan.   I was called by someone from the 
school system and told that Tyler did not get his choices. I was given a 
list of schools to choose from and told my daughter did get one of her 
choice.   After receiving a letter that my daughters school hadn't been 
determined, I went and filled out another paper to get an 
answer.(3/19/03). On 04/16/03 I called the school admin office to see 
what was going on. I was informed that my daughter didn't get her choice 
and was being sent to Fairmont Park Elem, a school I had never heard of. 
  I am upset because this
school is so far away.....   There are alot more schools closer then 
this one.   Or I could have sent
my daughter and nephew to the same school, if I was given the option for 
my daughter.   But instead some unknown person was able to decide what 
school she will go to.       

My last option if I am unable to get a scholarship is home schooling.   
I am not going to have my
daughter go to school that far away on the southside were she may have 
to wait at one school to
get another bus to take her the rest of the way to her school.   And 
with home schooling my daughter may not be able to get a real diploma or 
go to a college. I feel my daughter is  not getting
a fair chance.

I feel that this change from zoned to choice has problems.   The African 
Americans wanted  to stop
busing and to go to schools near them.   But yet they are still choosing 
school on the northside and
have to be bused still.   Causing the Causation children to be bused far 
away on the southside to make up for lack of student enrollment.

This system is going to cost more with all the different buses coming to 
the same area to pick up kids and then take them to different schools.

I know that my daughter and I are just two little people out of 
 millions, but I just wanted to let
how I feel .   I also wanted to let you know how sometimes we making it 
but just barely making it people get lost.   We don't make enough to do 
and yet make to much to get.

                                                                        
       Thank You  for Your Time
                                                                        
                 Sincerely,

Jeb

I have been following the Florida discussions regarding malpractice
caps and tort reform.  I very much appreciate your support.  I have
written every Senator and Florida legislator regarding this issue.

I can tell you from firsthand experience that I foresee trauma centers
becoming depleted of physicians and closing.  Here in Brevard County,
there is no question that the public health is improved and best served
with the trauma center at HRMC in Melbourne.  I have been in practice 15
years, and have worked at all the community hospitals, clearly HRMC ,
with the trauma center provides much more sophisticated care overall,
not just in trauma.  

There is no question that if Floridians are involved in significant
traumatic events such as accidents and motor vehicle collisions they are
much better served in the trauma center.

Currently our trauma program is in jeopardy.  Only four surgeons out of
19 orthopedic surgeons remain as participating.  The main issues being
liability exposure as well as reimbursement for rendering sophisticated
care on frequently indigent or minimally insured patients.

I know you plan to convene a special session of the legislature to
address this issue.  The Florida Senate remains a major hurdle.

Best wishes for a success, keep up the great work!

Proud to be an American!

Hi Jeb,

 

I am on a committee that is putting together a huge fundraiser on Sept. 11th at the TD Waterhouse Centre in Orlando. It is called “911 For Charities”.   Instead of competing for funding, dozens of non-profits in Central Florida are working together to put on a spectacular event under one roof.

 

As I’m sure you know, the City of Orlando has had to cut another 6 million dollars of local non-profit funding from its budget to help balance their books.  This comes at a time when local non-profits are receiving fewer donations from the community and less from larger funding sources due to the economy.

 

CharityForCharities.org was formed to assist Central Florida non-profits in raising desperately needed funds at this time.  A “letter of support”, a “letter of recognition” or some form of acknowledgement from you about this gala event will help us in our fundraising efforts.  When you have time, check out our website,  <http://www.charityforcharities.org/> www.CharityForCharities.org, to get a more comprehensive view of this fundraiser.

 

Will you be able to assist in some way?  It would be great if you could attend this grand event and it would be even better if you would make this your official 9-11 event for 2003.

 

Below I have written a sample letter of support from you that will help us get sponsors and donations.  Is this something that you could help me with?  If so, could you put it on your official letterhead and mail it to me? (3536 Edlingham Ct., Orlando, Fl. 32812)

 

Thanks,

Tinker

 

 

September 11, 2001 had a devastating impact on our nation and non-profit agencies have been impacted substantially in their ability to raise funds to continue to provide services to meet our communities’ need.

 

To compound the financial woes of local agencies, many municipalities and large foundations have found it necessary to cut back on funding of these charitable causes.

 

Anytime 5,000 people join forces to support 50 non-profits in raising one million dollars for their causes, only greatness can be achieved.

 

I know that the Central Florida community is in support of “911 For Charity”, but I want you to know that you have my support in accomplishing your goals as well.

 

 Jeb Bush

I am completely against the law under "discussion" with retard to mandatory seat belt use.  This is another intrusive law that will stop motorists by law enforcement instead of law enforcement going after "real problems".  This will also lead to "racial profiling".  I understand this is a cash cow and easy money from the Federal government as well as new income for the state and counties - however, don't you think this is a bit too much?

Aren't Republicans for less government intrusion?

To the Honorable Governor Jeb Bush:
     In a short time you will, as I understand it, appoint Mr. Jim Jancey to replace Mr. Jim Warford as Superintendent of Schools for Marion County. I would kindly ask you to reconsider such a move. Following this e-mail will be a two page fax that I believe will make my request worthy of serious consideration. One shall be Mrs. Evelyn Kelly's bio which makes very clear her exceptional credentials for such a position. She ran for this office in 1992, defeated Mr. Yancey handily but was in turn defeated with no small help from Mr. Yancey. Which brings me to the second page which is an ad run in the local paper the day before the election with Mr. Yancey boldly supporting (with signature attached) the democratic candidate, Mr. John Smith. 
     I ask you Sir, why would a Republican turn against his own party and publicly declare for the democrats? I do not believe we need such people in this party, let them belong to the party they support.
     Mrs. Kelly would be an exceptional choice as both a very well qualified candidate and one who takes the matters of God seriously. This is what we need in various positions as representatives and leaders, not those who at the drop of a hat will switch sides simply for expediency's sake. 
     Think well on the matter Mr. Bush and put in this office one who you really believe will serve well the people of Marion County, Yourself, the Republican Party and the God who remains sovereign over all His creation.
     Thank you, Governor.

Dear Governor Bush,
While reading an article in the local newspaper StarBanner,I learned that Mr. 
Warford
present Superintendent of Schools is resigning his position to accept the 
post of Chancellor Of Education in Tallahassee.

As a registered voter and a Conservative Republican, I am sick and tired of 
voting and supporting candidates who do not keep their word.
         
I was at a meeting where Mr. Warford spoke about two months ago,he stated he 
would finish out his term. Evidently Mr. Warford disregards the voters who 
put him in office. BUT as Governor, do you also not take into consideration, 
that constituents work hard to elect people to office to best represent them? 
Not just stay in that elected office till something better comes along.I say 
this because you are suppose to be the one appointing him.
What is the Difference between Mr. Warford's resignation and  A Jumping Jim 
Jeffords ?

The Assistant Superintendent, Mr. Yancey,according to the article, is to be 
appointed by you to finish out Mr. Warford's term.
My problem with Mr.Yancey,is that in the 1992 Primary, he endorsed a Democrat 
candidate against a Republican candidate.
Voters must hold candidates responsible for not carrying through, with the 
platform they pledged to up-hold when running for office. Too often our 
politicians do not even read the legislation they pass,that we have to live 
with. Let alone keep campaign promises.

Governor, please if this is not a done deal, consider Evelyn B. Kelly, PhD.
She taught in Marion Co. Schools for 37 years.She is a proven Writer, wrote 
Memory Enhancement for Teachers, Legal Basics for Educators also a certified 
medical writer for Genetic Engineering. Doctor of Philosophy University of 
Fl., Fl. Atlantic University, Boca Raton, advanced studies. Master of 
Religion Southern Baptist Seminary. Has a B.A. from University of Tn. where 
she majors in English and pre-med studies,microbiology;minor in political 
studies.
Ran as a Republican Candidate for Marion Co. Superintendent of Schools in '92 
on a platform of systemic change.And many more Worthy Accomplishments.
Evelyn Kelly, will bring to the office of Superintendent of Schools a credit 
of confidence, her character and abilities  make her a outstanding APPOINTEE .
Please consider her.
Thank you.                  Maria Ezell

The DOR/SBA merger legislation is being heard in the Senate subcommittee on

	My name is Seth Mollitt and I am a junior at Samuel W. Wolfson High School 
in Jacksonville, Florida.  I recently was selected for and attended the 
Governor’s High School All Star lunch in Tallahassee.  During that lunch you 
told us a story about one of your interns.  You said that you had met that 
intern when she and her mother had come to you expressing a concern about 
the arts program at their local high school, and you then told how you had 
tried to help that problem.  Today I am writing you, on behalf of our 
student government, and our faculty, with a concern about our school, and I 
only hope that you will be able to help.
	As a member of student government I was recently asked to come and sit in 
on a faculty Shared Decision-Making Committee meeting.  At this meeting 
several teachers raised concern about the rising number of discipline 
problems at the school, and the students’ increasing defiance and hostility 
toward teachers.  The faculty expressed concerns about the fact that 
students were openly refusing to give teachers their name, and would run 
from teachers when caught breaking school rules.  They also voiced the 
opinion that it seems to be the same group of people breaking the rules 
every time.  The faculty questioned our principal Fred Christmann about the 
problem and asked if he could remove these people from the school, as they 
were proving to be nothing but problems.  The principle responded by saying 
that he had tried on numerous occasions, but that every time the parents had 
gone over his head to the regional superintendent, and he had been ordered 
to let the students back in.  Upon hearing this, the teachers suggested that 
he contact our school board member Kris Barnes and ask her to come to one of 
their meetings so at least they could voice their concerns to her.  The 
principal obliged, but when he called her office he was told that she was 
not allowed to attend such meetings.
	This problem, as you can tell, troubles the faculty at my school, but as a 
student there, it also concerns me.  I can attest to the fact that everyday 
I see the same students defying teachers, starting fights, wandering the 
halls when they should be in class and just breaking the rules in general.  
I have often wondered why they students did this, and now I learn that it is 
because our faculty is virtually powerless to stop them.  Our teachers and 
administrators have their hands tied behind their backs.  These habitual 
offenders don’t care if they are suspended, they don’t care if they receive 
a referral, and in fact it appears that there is little they do care about.  
Students like this should not be allowed to stay at school and disrupt it 
the way that they do.  How can teachers and administrators stand up to 
problem students if every action they take is negated by the district 
office? Why is it when they try to raise these concerns to the district 
office they are rebuffed?  If the state of Florida wishes to make their 
schools a place of quality education then they must give teachers the power 
to do this.
	Obviously I know that you can do nothing to affect the actions and 
attitudes of problem students.  All I am asking for is that you look into 
this problem and see what you can do to strengthen the power of our teachers 
and administrators.  Schools are supposed to be safe learning environments.  
During my three years at Wolfson this has ceased to be the case.  Since my 
freshmen year I have seen the behavior at my school consistently degrade, 
and I have seen good teachers leave the profession simply because they were 
afraid to come to work each day.  At the lunch in Tallahassee you gave me 
the impression of someone who really cares about the education system in the 
state of Florida, and I sincerely hope that I did not misread you.  The 
faculty of Samuel W. Wolfson High School, the student government, and I 
would truly appreciate your help in solving this problem.

Sincerely,
Seth Mollitt
2003 Governor’s High School All Star

Perceptions color affirmative-action stance
Full story: http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/northwestlife/134678925_jdl20.html






Supreme Court justices aren't the only people mulling over affirmative action. When I wrote about two court cases against the University of Michigan earlier this month, lots of readers offered me their thoughts. 

One case involves two rejected white students who challenged the University of Michigan undergraduate admissions practice of adding 20 points to the scores of black and Latino applicants. 

Another white prospective student sued the Michigan law school, which doesn't use points but does try to put together a diverse class.

Most of the responses were against the practices.

A Kirkland reader wrote, "I feel the time for affirmative action should come to an end. There are many people that feel this way. In fact, I believe it to be the majority of people. It would be interesting to have a vote on it today and see how it would turn out. Of course, that vote or poll should take into account a cross section of the United States rather than just a highly liberal place like Seattle."

In fact, most people say diversity is a good thing &#151; 80 percent in an Associated Press  poll last month. That poll found 53 percent of Americans favored doing something to make sure black people, Latinos and Native Americans have a better shot at college. 

But different wording and timing can elicit different results. Another poll I read this week asked specifically about using race in college admissions. Seventy-three percent opposed the practice.

That tells me perceptions play a big role in determining where people stand on the issue, and whether they believe the program is correcting a problem or giving an unfair advantage. 

That Kirkland reader said it would be OK to give preferences based on class. For many people, race doesn't seem like an issue anymore. This despite reams of evidence of race-based disparities in access to jobs, in pay levels, in health care, in access to good schools and so on. 

When there are so many disadvantages attached to race, one reader found it odd that opponents of affirmative action criticize consideration of race while remaining silent about other forms of affirmative action.

This particular reader, a supporter of affirmative action, pointed out that several white applicants with scores lower than the plaintiffs were admitted to the law school and to the freshman class, but their admission was not challenged.

"Why is that so? Do lower scores only matter if the applicant is black? Why did (plaintiff Barbara) Grutter not challenge the admission of the white applicants?

"It seems that race only matters if the applicant is black. It is OK to be a 'less qualified' white?"

Race was very much the point for some readers, who suggested that bringing up the issue was itself the problem. As one reader put it, race "will be an 'issue' so long as people like Jerry propagandize its 'reality.' "

The reader continued: "If I were suddenly a minority in Zimbabwe would I start out 'equally' with all those in the majority? And 'racial discrimination before affirmative action' is a red herring. It's (racial discrimination) what has occurred since affirmative action and the social changes instituted through a sea change of attitudinal uplift.... "  

The reader went on to argue another angle of what he sees as discrimination: "Whites are 'inferior' athletically in the same way that blacks are academically. Can you refute that statistically?" 

Well, let's see. No, you wouldn't start out equally in Zimbabwe. Whites own 90 percent of the corporations, a majority of the best farmland and so on. So you'd definitely not start out as an equal. 

And I'm glad you cleared up the issue of when race problems began. Gosh, I must have been mistaken about slavery and Jim Crow.

As for sports, it hasn't been very long since black people, no matter how talented, were barred from playing. Since opening up, sports have attracted a lot of talented black youngsters because people put their effort where the opportunities are.

You just have to open doors and give people a chance to show they can excel. There is no perfect, painless way to do that, but the alternative is to leave much of America's talent sitting on the sideline. 

Maybe someday we'll fix K-12 education. Maybe someday we'll get serious about fighting poverty. But until then, it will remain necessary to take an extra step, positive action to correct our path.

Governor: Thanks so much for meeting with Vicki Tschinkel and me earlier this week. We know how busy you are. And thank you again for your leadership on Florida Forever. 

With regard to the open space plan for the Florida Panhandle, we believe this is a unique and fleeting opportunity to save northwest Florida's environment while at the same time creating the conditions for a strong and sustainable economy. Doing this would be a wonderful legacy for the future of Florida and an example of public/private cooperation of national significance.

If this concept has merit in your view, we thought it might be useful to list some specific steps that your administration might take to further its implementation:

1.	Create a task force to review, revise and oversee implementation of the plan. The task force might include key members of your administration, local government, the military, major business and landowner interests and environmental groups. Perhaps the Wekiva Task Force is a model for what might be done. Obviously much pre-planning is required for this to be successful. 

2.	Continue to work with the Department of Defense on appropriating funds for the purchase of conservation easements to create the defense corridor connecting Eglin to the Apalachicola Basin. Mollie Palmer has been very, very helpful on this, but our guess is that actual appropriations will ultimately require high level involvement. Congressman Miller's office is very supportive of this as are the Eglin military and civilian leadership. 

3.	Continue to place high priority on northwest Florida projects identified on the map for ranking and acquisition by Florida Forever. 

4.	Ask DCA to work with local governments and major landowners to create sector planning processes or other innovative methods for areas where growth, military operations and important conservation resources may conflict. The West Bay Sector Plan is an example of the sort of thing which might be done elsewhere. 

5.	Design state-funded infrastructure investment to reinforce implementation of the plan 

6.	Encourage the St Joe Company to work together with the Division of State Lands, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and The Nature Conservancy to set out a long term plan for acquisition of conservation lands by purchase or through mitigation that might dovetail with other elements of the plan.

Thanks again for your leadership.  Have a good Easter holiday.

Dear Governor Bush;

        The Sugar Industry has way too much power. True, it supports many people in the Glades but one wonders at what total cost to Mr. and Mrs. America and the environment. 
        Much excellent science has gone into proving that 10ppb and NOT 15ppb is the requisite standard for waters to enter the greater Everglades. I just returned from the Joint Conference on the Science and Restoration of the Greater Everglades and Florida Bay Ecosystem and the central creed of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) , "Getting the Water Right", relies tremendously on being able to decrease the loading of phosphorous (P) into the Glades. 
        I, and others, take extreme umbrage at the monetary concessions given to a single private industry-namely 'Big Sugar' (Azucar Grande!). Not only do they receive subsidies to keep the price of sugar low to the consumer, but the U.S. buys sugars and then pays the industry to store it and for what end no one knows. Next "we" are building "Stormwater Treatment Areas" (=STAs), which were once called Everglades Nutrient Removal (ENR) cells, to process agricultural water. True, some of the pollutants derive from urban / rural areas, but very little relative to the mega-tons from big Ag.
        The bottom line is, the citizens of Florida and the United States in general have paid and paid for this one industry. It is time to stop! The Caribbean nations, Cuba included, grow sugar cane and can grow more. It is time for us to help them and do our Everglades a tremendous service in the bargain.
        Please stop the influence of these sugar lobbyists listen to the good science which you have in your hands and in the hands of your staff.
        Phosphorous = 10ppb, it is the right thing to do.
          Nitrogen from the Dade County Ag area is next!
        Thank you for your time and consideration.

Subject: Concerned parent informing you

I am the Mother of Joshua Nunley who attends Gulf Middle School. He is an ESE student for emotional issues. He is an A/B student with goals of college for his future. He is 14 years old and having difficulty at best getting through life's struggles being a teenager. Joshua has been to the best therapists and Doctors to keep us informed to be prepared for these days. Joshua has started to runaway as a way of dealing with issues. He has begun to smoke pot and his education is being jeopardized. The Cape Coral Police Officer Cunningham told us to call the school to get a referral to the truancy and runaway program offered through the county and supported by the school team. The folks at Gulf Middle are not aware of this program and on top of that, they informed Joshua that if he does not come to school the rest f this year he will still go to High School because his FCAT score is high and his grades are high from first semester. Well Joshua is back on runaway. Yesterday Ms. Saunders verified this information is correct. I find this ludicrous, further more furnishing a child in an emotionally unbalanced state the information set his education up to fail. I would like you to inform your staff at Gulf Middle it is against the law for the child not to attend school. As Joshua's Mother I hold your staff accountable for these absences as Joshua is under the impression he has "permission to not attend school" per your staff. Joshua has an IEP to direct his education. I am a strong team member as is his step Father. We wish another IEP be scheduled so we can get it into his plan that he indeed be required to attend school and obey rules to move into  High School. In all your years of teaching I am sure you of all people know that if Joshua is not on track entering High School statistics tell where his future is heading. I need a team behind his education for Joshua to get to college as he deserves.
Thank you for your time. I will call officer Cunningham to get the information to the school as well.
Sincerely,
Mary Pringle

thank you Farnoosh. Being an intelligent person that I know you are, tell me what cuts have occurred? this year, there was a 6% per student increase. this was higher than all but one state. In your capacity, have you asked the tough questions about how there are cuts with this type of increase? Next year, the situation is not nearly as good because much of the increase will go to the class size decrease. As it relates to Bright Futures, while still in doubt, it appears that there won't be any cuts for students in the coming year. I appreciate your writing.

Dear Mr. Bush,
 
    Hello again! My name is Farnoosh Bazargan, I've written to you countless times before and I was also a High School All-Stars. I attend Palm Beach Gardens High School and I am a senior I will be attending FAU Honors college next year. I find it imperative again to write you another letter concerning an issue that has hit me closer to home then I would have liked. In Palm Beach County, I serve as the Palm Beach County Council of Student Councils President and a student seated liaison for the School Board. Recently my council has been requested to join in a Call to Action to protest against cuts concerning our budget and to plead with you to increase funding. The students of Palm Beach County have been working with their teachers and their School Board to make unprecedented strides toward academic and extracurricular success. The long-term plans that our School Board has been working so tenaciously towards are in danger of being set back. I can only speak on behalf of Palm Beach County High School Students, being that I was elected to represent that population and on their behalf I must voice our opinion. Palm Beach County Schools are in danger of losing our 7th period day, our magnet programs, full time kindergarten, sports and much much more! Its no secret that education in Florida isn't exactly the first in the nation and more budget cuts toward this area would be disastrous. Students are already learning under pressed conditions, and their anger at their predicament only grows with each program we lose due to inadequate funding. I am a senior and I will be graduating in less than a month. True. But the students that I leave behind have the possibility of losing the programs that have made me into who I am today and given me the wisdom and opportunity to achieve all that I possibly can. My concern is that soon, the amount of devastating blows to education, including the removal of Bright Futures, will only worsen Florida's future at a well-educated population or even keeping students to stay within the state. When students begin to feel that their government doesn't care about their needs or their education, it does not matter how high they must climb the ladder to point a finger, they will target their hostility and frustration somewhere. It has always been my opinion that our governmental leaders and representatives should open their ears and eyes to a population so easily ignored. The students may not be able to cast a vote today, but they will tomorrow, and the future of Florida will be in their hands. I trust you will not let the problems facing education in Florida snowball into greater and perhaps irreversible tribulations. Thank you for your time and your efforts.
 
Warm regards,
Farnoosh Bazargan
Palm Beach County Council of Student Councils President
Palm Beach County

Governor,
 
Last we communicated after my Florida Senate race against Debbie Wasserman Schultz, I told you I still wanted to serve my community and focus on my key campaign platform of improving the quality of our workforce.
 
Yesterday Paul Anderson resigned from the BCC Broward Community College Board of Trustees effective at the end of May.
 
At the suggestion of many Broward civic, business, and community leaders, I plan to apply for that position. In fact many of them will be contacting you in the days to come to show their support for me.
 
This position will enable me to offer the BCC Board my business management and entrepreneurial skills I have developed over the past decade while owning two successful business equipment dealerships here in South Florida. More importantly, I will be able to help set the policies to ensure that BCC produces quality graduates for our workforce.
 
I am completing my Questionnaire For Gubernatorial Appointments and will be sending it to your office for delivery tomorrow. I hope that you will give it due consideration.
 
Thank you in advance for your consideration of my application to join the Broward Community College Board Of Trustees.
 
Regards,

Jeb,

Thanks for your response...

We have taken the Florida School Report into the classroom and under the auspices of the Council for Educational Change, have created an other online tool called SnapShot. This tool can help teachers establish student benchmarks and individualize instruction so that students do gain a year's worth of instruction every year. You will want to see this - it is cutting edge.  I'll have John Hansen, our resident consultant, contact Sharon to demo SnapShot, our latest data analysis tool.

SnapShot is an online tool that has all FCAT and NRT data presented by student by teacher (class by class at the middle and secondary levels) for an entire school.  You can pull up a teacher's class roster(s) and have displayed the students' FCAT results for up to 3 years (tests and subtests), their achievement levels, the list of those who made learning gains at all levels, charts and graphs that relate performance on both Math and Reading, expectancy tables, and gain/growth across multiple years.  Data are obtained from the district so that no entering of data nor creation of graphs are necessary.

Please let me know if I can be of further assistance...  I'll look forward to seeing you at the Florida Council of 100 and at our Summer Leadership Academy.

Take care,

Hi Governor,

Thank you for your email.  I know you are working as hard as we are to
help these kiddos.  

Our former assistant principal, Valerie Reddick-Mason is now the
principal at a double F school.  Our school (very high SES) has been
sending teachers to work with their students on weekends and for several
weeks prior to the FCATs to review basic skills and problem solving
strategies.  We also donated money to purchase school T-shirts for every
child at that school.  I believe that this type of "school mentoring" is
really important.  Just wanted to let you know that your message is
getting out.  Hopefully, her school, West Riviera Elementary in Riviera
Beach, will rise to the challenge on paper.......they've certainly tried
in spirit!

Hi Laura:
 
Pursuant to our conversation, please inform Kathleen Shanahan, who I understand will be attending the Republican Governors Association, Georgia Governors Forum on 4/23/03, that Daniel J. Hilferty, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Deirdre Bailey, Associate Vice President of External Affairs of AmeriHealth Mercy, will also be attending.  Additionally, Daniel J. Hilferty will be a panelist on the Medicaid Governors Roundtable 1, at 9:30 AM on 4/24/03.  As you are aware, a group of us in Tampa (Simone Gans Barefield, Ernest Barefield, Dr. Donald Temple, Dr. Walwin D. Metzger) are currently attempting to attract AmeriHealth Mercy and its family of companies to Florida.  Our objectives are twofold:  (a) to assist the company to expand into Florida, by them designing a plan that meets the needs of the State of Florida to provide cost-effective and affordable health care to the poor and disadvantaged, and (b) create a joint venture in Florida with a group of African American Doctors whose offices are located in low-income areas and primarily serve Medicaid patients. 
 
Be apprised has a result of our meetings on 4/2/03, with Dr. John O. Agwunobi and Dr. Rhonda Medows, I met on 4/21/03, with Daniel J. Hilferty, President and Chief Executive Officer, Michael A. Rashid, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Thomas Lynman, Senior Vice President, Market Expansion and Planning, Deirdre Bailey, Associate Vice President of External Affairs, and Ernest Barefield, President of Barefield & Associates to establish a plan of action for their expansion into Florida.
 
AmeriHealth Mercy and its affiliated health plans comprise the largest multi-state Medicaid managed care organization in the United States with over 20 years of experience.  The company has more than one million members in four states (Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Kentucky, and South Carolina), making them the industry leaders and providers of Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Programs.  AmeriHealth Mercy was founded in 1982, with a stated mission to provide quality and accessible healthcare services to populations most in need of assistance.  The company is headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; employing 1,600, and has a combined annual revenue of  $2 billion (AmeriHealth Mercy & Keystone Mercy).  The company is a joint venture partnership between Independence Blue Cross and Mercy Health System.  
 
I take this opportunity to thank you once again  for the assistance you have given me, and the courtesy extended to my associates in this endeavor.  I look forward to getting together on my next visit to Tallahassee.

GOOD AFTERNOON, GOVERNOR BUSH, 

I REALLY HESITATED IN WRITING TO YOU, BUT I THOUGHT I WOULD TAKE A CHANCE. 

I WORK AT LAKE GIBSON HIGH SCHOOL IN LAKELAND - A SCHOOL THAT HAS SO MANY GOOD THINGS HAPPENING!  BESIDES OUR TRADITIONAL SCHOOL OF OVER 1600 STUDENTS, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A CHARTER SCHOOL -A SCHOOL WITHIN A SCHOOL OF ABOUT 200 STUDENTS.  MOST CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE FOR THE EXTREMELY SMART/TALENTED STUDENTS.  OURS IS DESIGNED TO HELP THE "AT RISK" STUDENTS WHO ARE IN DANGER OF NOT GRADUATING.  THEIR SUCCESS HAS BEEN AMAZING!  THEIR ACHIEVEMENT HAS BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY OUR DEDICATED EDUCATORS WHO REALLY WANT TO SEE OUR STUDENTS RECEIVE A GOOD EDUCATION SO THEY WILL HAVE THE CONFIDENCE AND SELF ESTEEM  THEY NEED TO GO ON TO BE PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS. IT IS AMAZING HOW MANY OF OUR  CHARTER SCHOOL STUDENTS HAVE DONE A 180 DEGREE TURN-A-ROUND.  OUR PRINCIPAL, MR. RALPH A. GILCHREST III,  LEAD THE WAY FOR THIS CHARTER SCHOOL TO BE ESTABLISHED.  OUR "TRADITIONAL" SCHOOL HAS ALSO HAD AN AWESOME YEAR, BOTH IN ACADEMICS AND ATHLETICS.  SO, NATURALLY, WE WERE ALL OVERJOYED WHEN  MR. GILCHREST WAS RECENTLY  NAMED FLORIDA'S PRINCIPAL OF THE YEAR BY THE FLORIDA ASSOCIATION OF SECONDARY SCHOOL PRINCIPALS.

I KNOW YOUR SCHEDULE IS TREMENDOUS, BUT LAKE GIBSON HIGH SCHOOL WOULD BE SO HONORED IF YOU COULD ATTEND OUR GRADUATION.  YOUR HARD WORK TOWARDS IMPROVING OUR EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN OUR STATE IS QUITE EVIDENT AND WE THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE TO BE A PART OF THE CELEBRATION OF OUR STUDENTS HARD WORK HERE AT LAKE GIBSON. OUR GRADUATION WILL TAKE PLACE AT THE LAKELAND CENTER ON MAY 20 AT 5 P.M. I KNOW THIS REQUEST IS OUT OF THE ORDINARY, BUT IF YOU COULD BE SO KIND TO COME TO OUR GRADUATION, IT WOULD MEAN SO MUCH TO OUR STUDENTS AND OUR COMMUNITY.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION.

Dear Governor,
 
I have a hypothetical (near-becoming-a-reality) question for you:  If a state university (such as UCF) gradually relies upon "private foundations" for funding its presidential compensations & projects---thus receiving less and less state money---does it then become a virtually autonomous autarchy answerable to no one, with no checks or balances on its power?
 
I ask you this, not to cause you headaches, but because I would hate to see the day when such a situation is in place at UCF wherein their jurisdiction to do whatever they please regardless of the effect on the community at large or on the environment is complete:  with no government oversight whatsoever!
 
Because I've written you so much on preservation issues you may think I'm a "big government" advocate---but I am surely not.  And I'm a Republican. But because growth in Florida looms so large on the roster of crucial quandaries to face, I see a State role as vital in tempering the impacts of excessive growth (in the wrong areas or directions)---and feel you must at least partly agree with this yourself (e.g. the Wekiva Task Force etc.).( Along this line,too, I urge you to keep the Department of Community Affairs separate from the Secretary of State---it is too essential to be dissolved, in my opinion.)
 
I don't want our university to become so quantity-oriented that it forgets half the schools of thought and erudition that makes its level of "learning potential" called "higher education"---i.e., the Arts, Natural Sciences, Philosophy, Literature, the Humanities, Music et al;  To judge from UCF's Master Plan, these enclaves of elevated thought and academic exploration are all but forgotten in the rush to accomodate simply MORE students.
 
QUALITY (and foresight) would imply preserving the woods in the northwest quadrant, for the academic attributes therein can't be measured.
 
Anyway, the money and political structures of UCF at this point matter to the future of this area---and I just hope you continue to bear that in mind, as our (very hardworking and, I believe well-intended) governor.
 
Yours sincerely,
 
Rebecca

You know I didn't think I would be writing to you again so soon.  I truly thought that the State Attorney's Office was handling my child support case and I was concentrating on settling the TSA Contract and moving forward.  But like the saying goes, "when it rains it pours."  I know your office does not handle Dade County Child Support Enforcement, but maybe it should.  My case is difficult because it is retaliatory in nature, but I think most child support enforcement cases are in that category.  I am sure that there are a few Father's who truly lose their jobs and can't pay child support, but those Father's probably don't have cases in the Enforcement Division.  Since they are sincerely looking for employment, their ex wives probably worked out an arrangement with them.  My case is different.  My ex husband didn't understand the consequences of stalking and harassment, and was livid when he got a Court Judgment ordering 26 Anger Management Classes and 26 Parenting Classes, in addition to other restrictions including a Civil Restraining Order with no expiration date.  After his attempt in Appealing the decision failed, his next alternative to get even was to stop paying child support.  It seems clear cut and obvious that he is following a certain retaliatory behavioral pattern, yet unfortunately, the State Attorney can't seem to be able to make a case or don't have funds to make a case.     

The response from the State Attorney's Office is disappointing and offensive.  It seems like they will only do so much and after that point, they fold.  I heard of legislation that was passed last year uniting the resources and funds from the Federal Government with the States, so I was shocked with their response.  So upset, that I am writing to you.  If State Attorney's Office cannot enforce child support because of lack of funds and resources, then they should not be responsible for Dade County's Child Enforcement Division.  The Criminal Division has funds and resources, and I feel that a parent who purposely lies to get out of paying child support with the purpose of causing suffering, is a criminal act.  There should be funds and a different caliber of attorneys working and using innovative methods in catching and enforcing child support payments.  Not attorneys that just give up.

Good Afternoon,

In reply to your e mail, it has become apparent that a decision has been made to reduce child support before it has even reached a Judge.  This is very sad.  The facts in this case demonstrate the willfulness and wantonness of the delinquent Father to continuing to not pay the Court Ordered support.  This Agency and office is to enforce child support not concede to the demands of the parent and his attorney who is not paying child support.  Should I tell my daughter that she will not eat this month nor have a roof over her head because her Father decided to remain unemployed for almost a year and not pay his child support and although the State Attorney's Office's function is to enforce child support, they don't have the funds to enforce and accept the word of a delinquent Father rather than use the resources available to them and look for the truth.  Information regarding his departure from his last job, previous years of salary, commission, and bonuses from other employers (which are only two and they are of the same corporation -- how difficult is that?).  Depose him and ask how he is meeting his financial obligations and paying for an attorney rather than going through legal aid, how he is able to pay his mortgage, go on trips, eat out at restaurants and go boating every weekend, in addition to the numerous weekend vacations.  The evidence in this case shows that his lifestyle has not changed since he has been unemployed.  The evidence will also show that he is the owner of a Black BMW, new Toyota 4Runner, 2 Donzie boats, a car trailer for his two Porches, a classic Military Jeep, and a house valued at over $200,000.00.  These items can be sold in order to pay his child support.  The evidence shows that he received a lump sum of over $15,000.00 in severance pay which has disappeared.  The evidence will also show that he is not even looking for employment.  

This ex husband is very calculating and you should expect most if not all Fathers when they get mad because they have lost a few Court battles to retaliate by becoming suddenly unemployed.  My daughter visits on weekends and tells me the restaurants she went to that weekend, the boating, new antique furniture and letters from Goodyear.  I knew that my ex husband isn't depositing monies in his bank account and probably stopped charging the restaurants in his American Express.  He is an intelligent person very much prepared to never get a job until I lose my house.  This was told to you from the beginning.  The information he provided is all falsified.  Now the question is what are you going to do to see that justice be done.

Good afternoon


Please tll teh Cp that I have reviewed her case with the DEPUTY CHIEF - HOWARD POHL.  Unfortunately, we do not have the resources for an investigation in this case and therefore any request for an investigation has been denied.  The case will go to Court based on financial information provided by the partiesl.  We have done everything we can do in her case and will be setting the matter for a final hearing based on the information that we have.  Unless Mr. Vergara's financial circumstances change prior to the scheduled hearing, it is very likley that child support will reduce dramatically in her case.  She needs to be aware of this fact so that she can make her own decision as to what she wants to do in her case before we set the matter for Court.

I am forwarding you the answer that I received from the ASA.  If you have a question on your case, please contact the call center at 305-530-2600.

I recently went to the Child Support Enforcement Office to meet with the paralegal assigned to my case, Ralph Alonso, to update my Financial Affidavit and to deliver information that was being requested by my ex husband's attorney.  Discovery has been received by the State Attorney's office regarding my ex husband such as his bank statements, credit card statements, etc.  I think that it would be a good idea if copies of the information produced be sent or faxed to me for my review.  Since I have been in litigation for several years, I believe that I may be able to pick up on any changes and/or discrepancies.  It's been ten months, and I am still not receiving child support.

In January, we went to Court to recalculate the monthly child support.  Unfortunately, there was a slight reduction to the monthly amount, that my previous attorneys believe adamantely should have never taken place.  In addition to the reduction, I now supposedly owe him for back child support which amounts to about $2,000.00.  Again, there is case law on my side that states that when a downward modification is entered, it is not always retroactive.  I did not hear any argument as to defending the retroactive amount, and I feel that under the circumstances it is unjust.  I would like to know the status on that issue.      

Also, I would like to know if any subpoenas have been issued on my case or any type of investigation has been done regarding ex husband and his ability to maintain his lifestyle and pay his bills  while he claims to be unemployed.  

I await your response.

Dear Friend,
 
     The Democrat Party of Maryland continues to view me as their number one opponent in the Maryland Senate and is already working hard to discredit and defeat me.
 
     To counter this effort, the Governor of Maryland, Bob Ehrlich, has agreed to be our special quest speaker at my  Campaign Fundraiser at the Pastimes Café Restaurant in The Hampton Inn on Friday, April 25th, 2003. The VIP Reception will be 6:00pm-7:00pm and the General Dinner Reception 7:00pm-8:00pm.
 
     I am honored to have Governor Bob Ehrlich as my special guest at this event.  However, his presence does underscore the serious nature of the challenge I am up against and how important your financial support is to my campaign right now.
 
     That is why I hope you will join with Governor Ehrlich in supporting my campaign by serving as a Host ($1,000 and four VIP Reception tickets), Benefactor ($500 and two VIP Reception tickets), Patron ($250 and one VIP Reception  tickets), Sponsor ($100 and two General Dinner tickets), or Friend ($35 and one General Dinner ticket).  
 
     This event promises to be a fun get-together to celebrate the Governor’s first session. You will enjoy meeting him and hearing him speak about his first year as the Governor of Maryland. As you know, he is the first Republican governor Maryland has seen in over thirty-six years.  
 
     Also, I look forward to the chance to visit with my friends and supporters and share with you my view of the General Assembly session.
 
      I was proud to spearhead the effort on the Senate floor to stop forced taxpayer funding of abortion.  Although the vote on my amendment to stop you from paying for other people’s abortions failed by a close 20-25 margin, we now know exactly where each of my senate colleagues stand on the issue -- and who to target for future year votes.
 
      Then came the taxes. I suppose I should not have been surprised when the liberals decided to raise all sorts of taxes, hoping that you would forget by the next election in three and a half years. But even I was surprised how quickly and how many new taxes were rammed through.
 
The Washington Times reported on March 29, 2003:
 
 “The Senate approved about $111 million in tax increases and voted to continue providing state funds for Medicaid abortions and private school textbooks during debate yesterday on Maryland’s $22.5 billion budget.”
 
  “The tax bill would impose a one year surcharge of 10 percent on corporate income taxes, add a 2 percent tax on premiums collected by health maintenance organizations and triple the tax on cigars, chewing tobacco and snuff from 15 percent to 45 percent of the wholesale price.”
 
 “The tax bill was approved 26-18 on a mostly party line vote, although three Republican voted for the bill and seven democrats opposed it.” 
 
 “There was no debate except for brief comments from Sen. Alexander X. Mooney, Frederick Republican, who objected to the HMO tax... ‘I think health care is too expensive. That’s why I’m voting against the bill,’ Mr. Mooney said.”
 
       Rest assured, I oppose any and all taxes increases. I felt it was proud to defend our conservative values by standing up on the Senate floor and objecting to this huge tax bill -- at least pointing out the terrible new tax on health insurance for low income Marylanders who can least afford it.  
      We were successful this year in holding back all the attempts to infringe upon our Second Amendment rights. 
However, I am sure the relentless gun grabbers will be back next year with more ideas on how to make it more difficult for law abiding citizens to own a firearm. With your help we can fight back again.
 
     It is important that I have the resources to communicate with my constituents about the work I have been doing in Annapolis to further our shared Republican agenda.
 
     I hope you will join me at The Hampton Inn on April 25th for a fun celebration with Governor Bob Ehrlich!
 
     Your Support of this event will give me the financial strength I need to continue fighting for our shared values.
 
     Please say you will help my campaign by serving as a Host ($1,000 and four VIP Reception tickets), Benefactor ($500 and two VIP Reception tickets), Patron ($250 and one VIP Reception tickets), Sponsor ($100 and two General Dinner tickets), or Friend ($35 and one General Dinner ticket).  
 
     Now I need your financial support to defend my pro-business and pro-family voting record.
 
     Thank you for your support.  If you have any questions, or wish to reply, please call (301) 620-0200.  I look forward to seeing you on April 25th at The Hampton Inn.
 
 
 
                             Sincerely,
 
 
 
                             Senator Alex X. Mooney
 
 
 
P.S.  Sadly, I cannot stress enough how important money is in politics today. That is why I hope you will join with Governor Ehrlich in supporting my campaign by serving as a Host ($1,000 and four VIP Reception tickets), Benefactor ($500 and two VIP Reception tickets), Patron ($250 and one VIP Reception  tickets), Sponsor ($100 and two General Dinner tickets), or Friend ($35 and one General Dinner ticket).

Dear Governor Bush,

I am writing to express my dismay over the likely passage of a bill in the 
Florida Legislature that would defer any obligation to clean up any 
pollution by the sugar interests in the Everglades for 20 years.  As a 
member of the Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Foundation, we work tirelessly 
not only to preserve native habitat, but to purchase and restore land to 
its natural beauty.  To allow business interests to dictate when and if 
they will comply with a clean up obligation that scientists have already 
determined to be a 50% greater concentration than the Everglades can stand, 
is an affront to us and makes a mockery of
our local efforts.

It is my sincere hope that you will join with Porter Goss and Clay Shaw as 
well as Democrats and Republicans in the Interior Appropriations Committee 
in opposing this bill.

Thank you,
Carol A. Rothman

Hi Jeb,  Hope you and your family had a peaceful  Easter Holiday. 
This past Friday, Frank spoke to the Boca Raton Round Table at lunch and he was great, as usual, but it was so strange to hear all about FAU and what he hopes to accomplish.  I still see him in politics. 
On March 5, Mavis knight  from the Appointments office called me       and asked me about some people that had applied to different boards.  At that time I put in my application for the Palm Beach County Housing Authority.  I have an interest in that because it is PBCounty and  because of our younger son.  He is 28 and lives with us now, works at Publix, is  an ardent Republican and all is well now.  Someday, when we are not here 
I hope there is housing to take care of adults such as Ryan.   
He does not drive yet ,rides his bike all over.  4 wks. ago a women did not see him  and pulled in a driveway around a truck stopped on the side of the road and knockd him off the bike.  Thank the Lord he just had a compound fracture of the lt.arm near the wrist.  I was in D.C. for the NFRW Legislative Day  and came home to findhim in a cast.  Actually, he had to have surgery 4 days later and they put a plate and some pins in before putting the cast on again.  Never a dull moment! 
Jeb, I would sincerely appreciate anything you could do for a spot on the Palm Beach County Housing Auth. Board.   I did speak to Mavis 
again the week before Passover and Easter and she indicated that no decisions had been made at that time.   
Love to Columba and family. 
Yours very truly,

Governor:

I have given the issue of moving to FSU significant thought and prayer.  It
has not been an easy decision, but I feel like I can best make a difference
and advance the mission by moving to FSU, which can serve as an incubator
for a choice agenda in Florida.  If young freemarket conservatives do not
get involved in our Colleges of Education, our effort is in vain.  As I
wrote earlier, an FSU Education Reform Center focusing on school choice is
much needed. Also needed is the Voluntary Public School Choice Grant, and an
Education Reform Journal designed for national publication. With these
components, we can create a powerful mechanism to build a broad and
politically powerful consensus of individuals and organizations that support
education reform issues and increased parental options.  We have worked very
hard in the Choice Office to recruit choice-friendly districts.  We hope to
identify ten mentor districts.  Miami-Dade, Hillsborough, St. Lucie should
all be part of the effort.  The opportunity for directing this center,
marketing the successes of school choice, and creating a showcase of best
practices for public school choice that will be presented statewide and
nationally is critical to the future of school choice growth.  Again, this
opportunity is appealing to me, but only if: 1) I have your support; and 2)
It clearly advances your mission.

I have a meeting with Commissioner Horne on Thursday, and unless he has some
urgent need or task that he wants me to direct, I will discuss this issue
with him. I am excited to see that John Winn and Commissioner Horne recently
created the K-20 Research and Information Council to focus data-driven
policy development.  This effort will be vital to future success, but needs
to be coordinated closely with your office.  The department should also
consider creating additional research that will enhance these preemptive
policy analysis while coordinating and combining efforts simultaneously with
outside organizations.

I appreciate the opportunity you have given me. If you ever need me, I am
always an email or telephone call away.  I will be glad to work for you
anytime!  I have learned much about public service.  It is indeed a calling.
I actually enjoy the daily interaction with the many parents, citizens, and
schools. Many of the special interest groups can be frustrating at times,
but I also enjoy most of these interactions as well.

Governor, you are a humble man guided by ideals and timeless principles who
has great courage and intellect.  You seem very much like I imagine Solomon
in the Old Testament, with incredible wisdom and insight.  You are also a
true public servant.  I wish the citizens of Florida could see your efforts
on a daily basis- they would be amazed.  Governor, I also appreciate your
support and blessing.  I will keep you and your family in my prayers.

On another note:  We have our annual report due for our Charter School
Grant.  I am setting a May 16 date for completion by my office. It is due
May 23, 2003.  I want to finish this task.  It is important that we spend
some money. We received over $25 million, more than any other state.  And we
are in danger of having "too much" money after "finding" the unspent $12.4
million.  We have the money to create another charter resource center. My
advice is that you place it in south Florida, like FAU.  Glen Thomas and
Greg Alouia are true education reformers at FAU. Glen was a key to FSU
getting started in the Charter movement.  He is now at FAU.  UCF and UF are
other possibilities.  I really have no preference. I will ask the
Commissioner, but if you have any suggestions this would be helpful.  We
need to move very quickly on this, as we need to modify our budget narrative
on the grant by this week-  by the end of the month at the latest.  A new
center should focus on legal issues ("school or charter law") for the
districts and the schools, and perhaps be the center for mediation. It
should be coordinated with both of our centers at USF (resource, curriculum,
special education) and FSU (accountability, governance, management). There
is roughly $339,000 a year for three years to do this.

At your convenience, please let me know your thoughts on these matters.  I
look forward to hearing from you.

All the Best!  J.C.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
 
     Recently, there are two Developments of Regional Impact approved by St. Johns County that are being developed by a Company called Southstar.  Petitions will be filed with the Florida Land and Water Adjudicatory Commission asking for approval of establishment of Community Development Districts for both Abderdeen and Durbin Crossing.  Hopping Green & Sams will be filing the petitions and they will also be seeking Special Powers to exercise the power of Eminent Domain outside the repective boundaries of each development.  The transportation infrastructure is simply not there and these development orders should have never been issued without it.
 
     I am of the opinion that this power to take property does not belong to any corporation or any entity created by a private corporation.  This action is a real usurpation of government power by an artificial "mini government".  This is not a government approved by the people.
 
     Even though you may not be at liberty to respond since you are on the Commission that will be hearing this issue----I wanted you to be aware of the ramifications of this action.
 
     Also, I hope that something can be done about the formation of Community Development Districts as a way to front development money with special assessments levied against future residents of the Districts.  These developments float Tax-exempt bonds to be paid back over a many year period by the residents that eventually move into the Districts.  Basically, this is taxation without representation.  The law allowing this should be repealed by the legislature.
 
 
                                                                       Your Friend,

Dear Governor 

I have been involved in the prison ministry for almost 5 years now and in that time I have participated in several Kairos programs here at Tomoka CI in Daytona Beach. One of these programs is the Godparents program. 

 

I know that you are VERY busy with many VERY important projects and decisions that will affect the lives of millions of Florida residents, but I am concerned with an issue that could also affect thousands if not hundreds of thousands of Florida residents. 

 

I would like to invite you to come to Tomoka CI in Daytona some Monday night especially within the next couple weeks to see for yourself what the godparent program is doing. 

 

It is VERY important for you to come within the next couple weeks because you will get a true view of what the impact this godparent program has on inmates as the inmates that are  now in this godparents program are nearing the end of their time in the program. (April 21st is the last meeting for this group) 

 

The reason that I’m writing you is that the D.O.C. has stopped godparents from writing or visiting inmates. I understand the reasoning behind the D.O.C. stopping the godparents from writing letters to inmates, BUT godparents are NOT staff. We are volunteers. We are not paid to go to the prison and “feed” these men spiritual food. We do this because we want to show “love to the brethren.” 

 

I (and every other godparent I know) feel that godparents SHOULD be allowed to write (if not also visit) inmates because when the godparent program ends for them, many are still "boys" (if not still “infants) in the Lord and they need further follow up to get them to the place where they are strong enough to "stand" spiritually on their own. During these godparent meetings we cannot just preach to them. We have to gain their confidence first and that takes time ESPECIALLY in the prison environment. 

 

Because of a few misguided and/or selfish individuals that have abused our privileges, the D.O.C. has set “rules” that make everybody else suffer. Why do they make rules that punish “the innocent?” Why don’t they settle for punishing the offender? 

 

Back a couple years ago (group 2) there was one young man that had served 9 years of a 16-year sentence before coming into the godparent program. His family lives in Massachusetts and literally disowned him for being in prison. They wouldn't write to him and didn't visit. He went 9 years without a letter or a visit. Monday nights was his hope and he looked forward every week to his godparent coming to see him and he would get a letter from her a couple times a month. On the last night of his participation in the godparent program, he cried because he wouldn't have any more visits to look forward to until he was released in 7 more years. 

 

In that 7 years the hate and bitterness that IS prison life is most probably going to overshadow the 6 months of love and caring that he and other inmates like him were shown by their godparents. 

 

Almost all of these men are going to be released back into society someday. Do we want them entering society coming out of an environment of hate? Or one of love, concern, and caring?

 

They CAN come out of prison with the feeling of love, concern, and caring.

 

PLEASE say you’ll come.

 

I think that the Lord allowed your daughter to get caught so that you would be able to relate. She came VERY close to being sent to prison. Were just one more element added to her situation she could have been sent to prison for life.

 

PLEASE!

 

God bless you Governor

Subject:	Healthy Families Funding

Dear Governor Bush,

    I am contacting you on behalf of the Healthy Families/ Ounce of Prevention program in Martin County.  First of all I would like to thank you for your unwavering support of this vitally important program, and I appreciate your efforts to fully fund the Healthy Families programs statewide by including $12 million in expansion funds in this year's budget.

     I have had the awesome privilege to see the successes of this program through the eyes of the people we serve.  On April 3 of this year I accompanied a Family Support Worker and a participating family to Tallahassee to bring their message home. This young mother shared with the audience that she grew up in her hometown with five close girlfriends and today she is the only one who still has custody of her children. She credited Healthy Families for helping her to become a stronger parent, and stated she was grateful for Healthy Families and glad she gave it a try.  I think this truly is the reason this program is necessary for building strong families.

     As you are aware, Healthy Families is the only statewide, voluntary, community based child abuse prevention program that embraces the entire family and has documented outcomes that demonstrate the program's effectiveness in promoting self-sufficiency, improving medical care for Florida's impoverished children, and preventing the occurrence of child abuse and neglect.

    I urge you to continue your strong stance in persuading Senators and Representatives to include the additional funding for this program, so that Florida's children can remain safe and healthy in their own homes.

 

Sincerely,

Nancy Peck

Program Manager

Subject:	RE: Medicaid Task Force Call - Today at 3:30 p.m.


The Medicaid directors of the Governors' Task Force met in Washington
yesterday for five hours.  Bob Sharpe was here in D.C. and attended.  Dennis
Smith and a team from HHS/CMS participated for the majority of that time.
Dennis delivered some additional financing options as a framework for
discussion.  In addition, he presented a crosswalk between NGA's
recommendations and the Administration's proposal.

The bottom line is that the Administration has made a big effort to move
toward the Governors, addressing many concerns that have been expressed
previously.  They continue to be open to additional flexibility and other
alternatives on Medicaid financing.  It was apparent that the Medicaid
directors liked most of what they heard.  However, it also continues to be
painfully apparent that Washington staff "does not see how we can get beyond
the differences on financing."  In fact, the D's wanted to cancel the
Governors' call believing that there wasn't enough to discuss.  We pressed
for it, believing that we lose if the D's are defining the next steps
without input from the Governors.

After today's presentation by CMS, the ball is clearly in our court to
respond to the Administration's good faith effort to take this process
forward.  The Washington staff will meet today following the Governors' call
to look further at the financing piece.  For the Governors' call, we believe
it is important for there to be:

**acknowledgement of the good faith effort by Dennis Smith to modify and
expand the Administration's proposal to address issues raised by Governors'
Task Force.

**a Task Force recommendation to CMS for an alternative financing proposal

We believe this will box the D's into continuing to work on this reform
effort, making it increasingly difficult for them to walk away.  While they
are trying to play out the clock, we can continue trying to gain a
significant amount of consensus that may be the starting point for
legislation.

This discussion will be followed by a legislative update by Ray Scheppach on
the budget resolution and its implications for fiscal relief/dual eligibles,
and a Medicare drug bill.

Kim, you have every right to be mad and frustrated. I couldn't believe it when the news of the management actions became public. If there is good news, it is that management had to file that information with the government. I wish I could do something about this since I know that there are thousand of Florida families that will be impacted. 

Jeb Bush




Dear Governor Bush,

While I realize that honesty, integrity, good conscience & competent leadership cannot be legislated, corporate leaders must somehow be held accountable for decisions formulated with deception and greed.  Arrogantly pressing union employees to expeditiously vote (in violation of at least one union's Constitution & Bylaws), on a 6-year term, company savings package, which would sacrifice employment, salary and work rules, was offensive enough.  Doing so, under management's calculated guise of impending company bankruptcy, was deceitful.  Add to that, the after-the-vote revelation of bankruptcy-proof pensions AA's CEO & top management team had stealthily awarded themselves, through the manipulation of SEC filing dates, made the Tentative Agreement process completely appalling!

As a Florida constituent, I would like to see at least one of my elected officials step forward and release a public statement, admonishing the egregious business practices of the top management at American Airlines.  In a recent local news article, it was reported that nine thousand American Airlines employees reside in Miami-Dade County, alone.  American Airlines is Miami-Dade's lead employer.  

I believe the majority of our fellow residents support putting an end to corporate corruption.  I also believe, Floridians in recent years, have felt empowered by your innovative leadership, Governor Bush.  You have demonstrated a strength of character and uncommon courage by acting on your vision for governmental change, while upholding your values.

It's going to take some years of resolve to change the corporate structure & mindset in this country.  No doubt, a challenge of this sort is not going to be easy, but it must have a starting point.  As evidenced in so many ways in recent years, Americans are tired of being lied to.  We want to see an end to the proliferation of wrongdoing by a system which rewards it. We want our leaders to have integrity to face that which stands in our way, and the courage to lead us through it.

Governor Bush, you have done a fantastic job overhauling and improving many facets of the state of Florida.  Your Christian foundation, no doubt, has been a large influence in your leadership.  With that said, I leave you with this:

Christ came to all of us to lead us to His Father, yet He served His people.  Christ came to change our lives for eternity, yet He sacrificed His own life, first.  

All Jesus has asked, is for us to be more like Him. He has given us that choice to make for ourselves.

In Him & fondly,
Kim Gosnell
Jupiter, FL

Dear Governor Bush,

Thank you for taking the time to reply to my concerns.

You asked in your email, "What is the solution to avoid bankruptcy that will create such hardship for families associated with American Airlines?"

In all honesty, Governor Bush, I am not qualified to answer this question with an educated, financial response.  Simply put, I am a mother of two young girls, and wife of a 757/767 pilot currently employed at American Airlines.  My knowledge base is such that I have actively read and listened to analysts' proposals &opinions about the pros and cons regarding filing a Chapter 11 at AA.  Much of what I've come to learn about the aspects of this Tentative Agreement, I've learned from listening to the discussions my husband has had with his friends, and coworkers. 

It is no secret that AA is bleeding money.  The company cannot continue to exist in its current model.  Costs must be reduced or eliminated. All of this is understandable and acceptable.

What is unacceptable, is the permissive culture which has been embedded in corporate America for much too long, and although I am but one person, dog-gone-it, I just can't go to sleep another night without attempting to find someone who will listen, and hopefully, have on his or her person, a bullhorn!  No longer is there a moral decency to anything.  And for me, this day, I'm giving it my best shot.

I'm a "spirit of the law" kind of person.  I don't like loopholes or technicalities.  I believe in fairness, but not necessarily in equality.

So, when American Airlines proposed to (scammed) its three unions the current TA, I immediately felt disgusted with what was pushed upon us.  Beginning with the fact that:
1)  Didn't AA management see this beast coming?
   a.)  we know they did...we all did...
2)  Why wasn't there a plan in place months ago?
   a.)  we wrongly assumed that those being highly compensated (to say the least) among the corporate "heads" were diligently working on it.

In the days leading up to the last day to vote, the APA membership became concerned, that due to several aspects of the TA still being ironed out, there had yet to be a final, written agreement available for employee inspection.  Due to lack of reasoning within the union leadership &AA managers, several pilots felt it necessary to appeal before a judge for an injunction to halt the voting process until the contractual language was finalized, but the judge denied the request in the last day or two before the votes were to be counted.

Growing in helplessness, I watched as the Flight Attendants' union was granted an extra day to vote simply because the final tabulation of votes denied their TA.

Then...the largest blow to fairness came when the 30-40 management bonuses and bankruptcy-protected pensions were revealed in the AA SEC filing dated April 15, 2003.  Had most of the employees seen the large chunks of pie the CEO and his upper team members had allocated for themselves, in such dire company times, many union members have stated they'd have never voted to accept something so unfair, had they known all the facts.

The bottom line is that AA has been untruthful and unfair to its employees.  Managers have used their positions to reward themselves, while thousands of jobs were on the line.  

I think it's time that someone calls for some new leadership and guidance at AA.  This is not just a company, but a collection of mothers and fathers and regular people wanting a job with honest pay.  These are decent people working in a service industry who could use a break.  We need outsiders to come up with a fair plan for cost-cutting.  We don't trust the leadership at the helm anymore.  They are driving this ship into a storm, with their liferafts fully inflated and ready for departure.

Rats.  I apologize for this having been so long.  I've been working on this now for almost three hours, trying to condense my thoughts for you.  You are a *wonderful* Governor, by the way, and I pray for you, Columba, your children, your parents (whom I've especially adored since high school, and have held as personal role models in so many ways throughout the years)...and of course, your brother, the President (& my husband's Commander in Chief...Paul is a LtCol, USMC Reserves) &Laura, who is God-sent to this Nation, for these times.  You are a family of love and prayer, and sense, and fairness.  I have never for a second thought your family was here by chance, and I don't believe any one of you does, either.  It gives me such comfort knowing that you deeply care for the people you serve.

Well, sir, if you've read this far, again I thank you.  

Please accept my apologies once again for grammatical errors, and the like.  I need to get to bed (SAHMom), and want to send this off to you tonight.

God bless you for your sacrifices!

Sincerely,

Kim Gosnell

Dear Governor Bush,

Thank you for responding to my note.

We don't support the Bill(s) because of:

The 10 to 20 year delay proposed for compliance with phosphorous limits.
The proposed increase in phosphorous limits.(The science behind phosphorous
limits is available.)

The real threat that Federal funding might be diminished or lost.

The bill violates the Clean Water Act, the consent decree the state entered
into with Judge Hoeveler to settle the lawsuit begun under your father's
administration, and, in its apportionment of costs, the Florida
Constitution.

Specifically the bill limits the responsibility of the sugar companies to
what is practicable--an undefined standard that in common language means,
"Do your best, fellas" and would be productive of litigation.  It also may
still put off limits for the use of more acreage for STAs, which everybody
knows IS the most practicable way to achieve lower pollution numbers.  Also,
it goes directly contrary to the promises made by a state agency, the SFWMD,
to Judge Hoeveler last fall to meet the original Everglades Forever Act
timeline.

On the payments side it appears that the sugar companies are writing their
own recipe for how much they should pay when, the last we looked, the state
constitution said that they should pay all the cost of cleaning up their
impacts.  This inevitably means the rest of us will have to pay more.

Also, from a procedural standpoint, this unilateral, sugar-driven action by
the state legislature violates the consensus process that was so successful
from 1994 until now.

Thank you for listening,

Sincerely,
Erick Lindblad

Dear Governor Bush, 

As a parent, educator, and community member, I am urging you to support increased, adequate funding for education that will avoid drastic budget cuts now proposed in education.

If appropriate funding is not provided, the quality of educational services in our district will be greatly affected which will have a devastating effect for the future of our state. 

At this time the proposed cuts will result in the following cuts for Palm Beach County Schools:

·        Magnet Programs

·        7th Period Day

·        Full-time Kindergarten

·        Teacher Aides

·        High School Sports 

I am gravely concerned. If these cuts take place, the educational opportunities for students throughout the district will be negatively impacted. Please, for the sake of Florida students, take into consideration the following issues: 

     ·        the importance of sports and athletics in a student's overall growth, 

·        the need to keep 7th period day to meet student's learning needs, 

·        the importance of maintaining full-time kindergarten to prepare students for 1st grade, and 

·        the need to know budget dollars now so that teachers can be hired, supplies ordered and delivered and students properly scheduled before school starts on August 13th. 

I hope you make the right decision for all of us.

Lakeland, FL  33801


Dear Governor Bush, Toni, and members of the Legislature:

I am writing to thank our governor, Jeb Bush, for recognizing the need to
protect Florida's most vulnerable assets, our children.  I commend you for
your efforts to commit $12 million to Healthy Families Florida, the only
community-based child abuse prevention program in the state!  Your actions
have proven that you are sincerely concerned about the future of Florida.
Now, I would ask that the legislature please follow suit.   
	
I am a supervisor of a team of family support workers and family assessment
workers.  Daily we visit families who are in need; parents who don't know
the value of bonding with their babies by looking into their eyes and
talking to them; parents who don't realize that a baby cries for a reason or
how to recognize that reason; parents who may not see the importance of
immunizing their babies against terrible diseases.  These things may sound
basic to you, but these are things that an unbelievable amount of parents do
not realize!   These are usually parents who have very little support within
their own circles and feel like no one cares about them or their babies.  We
at Healthy Families help them see things in a positive, new light and give
them hope in times when they thought there was none.  We see the fruits of
our labor when we see happy, healthy, non-abused children!  This program
works!  There are thousands of children out there who are living proof of
that.  Healthy Families Polk alone serves more than 700 families per year!
Yet there are still so many out there who don't get the services because
they live in the wrong zip code or they don't speak English, etc.  

Florida needs more healthy families and Healthy Families is here to meet
that need!  Our outcomes have proven our effectiveness, and that should not
and cannot be ignored or denied.  Please do the right thing and fully fund
Healthy Families Florida!  Our communities cannot afford to be without it.


Sincerely,

Patrice Bryant

Florida Department of Education Names Marion County Superintendent James Warford as K-12 Chancellor
TALLAHASSEE – Florida Education Commissioner Jim Horne today named Marion County School Superintendent James Warford as Florida’s new K-12 Chancellor.  
 
 A biosketch and photograph of Warford are attached. 
 
“Under Jim Warford’s leadership, Marion County Public Schools have seen dramatic increases in student performance,” said Horne.  “We are fortunate to have someone as dedicated as Jim leading our state’s public schools.  I look forward to working with him to provide Florida’s teachers with the resources and accountability standards they need to afford our children a world class education.”
 
Warford has been successful in implementing new education programs. “Jim’s proactive approach to education policies has resulted in tremendous improvement for students in his district,” said Gov. Jeb Bush.  “He has made Marion County a model for school improvement and brings a wealth of educational experience to the Department of Education.”
 
As Superintendent, Warford led his district from three “F” schools, eight “D” schools and only one “A” school in 1999 to nine “A” schools, 13 “B” schools and no “F” schools in 2002.  Prior to his tenure as Superintendent, he taught for 14 years at Vanguard High School in Ocala.  Warford has also worked in his family-owned electrical manufacturers representative agency and consulting firm.
 
“It is a great honor to serve Florida’s school children, teachers and school districts in this capacity,” said Warford.  “I bring a real passion to this position and plan to focus like a laser on reaching Gov. Jeb Bush’s goal that every child is reading at grade level. That is the only way they can have access to all the opportunities this great country provides.”
 
As K-12 Chancellor, Warford will oversee the Division of Public Schools which includes such areas as school improvement services, curriculum and instruction, school safety, federal Title I programs and teacher certification. He earned a bachelor’s degree in communication from Western Kentucky University and a master’s degree in educational leadership from Nova Southeastern University.
 
“The educational successes seen in Jim’s school district indicate his ability to lead our K-12 public school system,” said State Board of Education Chairman Phil Handy. “The Board looks forward to working closely with Jim in every way possible to dramatically raise student achievement in K-12 schools throughout Florida.”
 
Warford currently serves on the board of directors of various organizations, including the United Way of Marion County, the Public Education Foundation of Marion County and the Marion County Economic Development Council.  
 
Warford’s wife, Susan, is a teacher in Marion County. They have three children.

Governor, 

I sent this e-mail to Mr. Stutler in your office, but also wanted to e-mail you about our concerns regarding the Wekiva legislation. As I'm sure you know -- and as you frequently lament during Cabinet meetings on property acquisition issues -- we have trouble squaring the private property rights issue with the rampant land speculation and planned development that opponents of the legislation envision for the basin. I am hoping that you and/or Mr. Stutler can detail your concerns, if indeed they still exist, so that we can move pro-actively to protect the Wekiva's springshed and provide new mobility options for the Central Florida region. Thanks.

Mr. Stutler, 

Sorry to bother you, and hope you got my phone message this morning. I'd very much like to discuss with you some of the concerns you have expressed to lawmakers -- I'm presuming on the governor's behalf -- regarding the Wekiva Task Force recommendations. This, of course, is an issue of critical concern to us here in Central Florida and we've been working closely with Secretary Struhs and Secretary Castille to protect the water resources that nourish the basin from land speculation and over-development while, of course, providing badly needed mobility options. Hence, if the governor has new "property rights" concerns about the task force recommendations mirrored in the Senate bill, it would be enormously helpful if we could discuss those and help guide debate toward swift resolution. Thanks so much.

                  Dear Governor Bush,
I am distressed to learn the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERF) is
in danger.  As a resident fo South Florida I am a strong supporter of repairing the
damage we have done to Everglades.  This unique environment should be protected
for many reasons.  I see hear no tangable argument for doing more damage to it.
Like the French opposing our actions in Iraq, are the people who want to see the
CERF destroyed going to benefit from inaction?  Please support the CERF.

Subject:	EFI Funding/State Budget Update


I am writing to thank you for responding to the 'call to action' in support of funding for Enterprise Florida, and to keep you informed on state budget negotiations taking place in Tallahassee.  As of this e-mail, there still seems to be a lack of agreement between the Senate and the House on the grand total of funding upon which to build the state's budget for the next fiscal year. The House contends that the state's budget should be built on existing and available revenue, while the Senate urges that additional revenue sources are necessary and should be identified. While both sides have stated that negotiations over specific programs and projects cannot begin until they agree on a starting point, official budget conferees have b een appointed. 

Earlier today, the Senate appointed their budget conferees. They are as follows: 

	Senator Pruitt, Chair 
Senator Wasserman Shultz, Vice Chair 
At Large: 
Senator Diaz de la Portilla 
Senator Jones 
Senator Klein 
Senator Lee 
Transportation and Economic Development: 
Senator Webster, Chair 
Senator Atwater 
Senator Hill 
Senator Sebesta 
Senator Siplin 

Last week, the House appointed budget conferees. They are as follows: 

	Rep. Bruce Kyle, Chair 
At Large: 
Rep. Lindsay Harrington 
Rep. Sandra Murman
Rep. Ronald Greenstein
Rep. Kim Berfield 

Transportation and Economic Development:
Rep. Leslie Waters, Chair
Rep. David Russell
Rep. Andy Gardener
Rep. Will Kendrick
Rep. Greg Evers
Rep. Donna Clarke 


Again, I thank you for your support and willing participation in advocating for the future of EFI and economic development programs for Florida.

Subject: Judge Hoeveler Orders Expedited Hearing May 2nd in Miami 

Press/For Immediate Release Joette Lorion     (305) 279-1166
Miami/April 23, 2003 

       Judge Hoeveler Orders Hearing to Discuss State Everglades Bill on May 2nd

The Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida announced  today that Judge Hoeveler has ordered a federal court hearing to be held on the Everglades legislation being steam rolled through the state legislature.  A hearing on the status of the Everglades cleanup was to be held on June 10th, , but Judge Hoeveler expedited the hearing in an Order received by the Tribe today. The  hearing on the status of the Everglades cleanup plan will now be held on May 2nd in Courtroom 9, at 301 North Miami Avenue in Miami, Florida beginning at 10:00 a.m. 

At the hearing, the  Tribe will raise concerns that if the amendments to the Everglades Forever Act (EFA) are adopted, there will be no guarantee that the state will meet the compliance dates adopted by the Judge in an amendment to the 1992 Consent Decree that settled the 1988 Everglades lawsuit.  In the original Everglades lawsuit, the federal government sued the state for not enforcing water quality standards in the Everglades.  The Tribe claims that this bill, which could soon  become law, shows that the state can not guarantee that the December 31, 2006, deadline to meet long term water quality standards will be met and enforced.  (The original date to meet final water quality standards was July 2002, and the EFA delayed that date.)

Dexter Lehtinen, the former U.S. Attorney for the state of Florida who filed the original 1988 lawsuit on behalf of the federal government, has represented the Miccosukee Tribe in the case since 1994.  Mr. Lehtinen, General Counsel for the Tribe on these matters, says the 500 member Tribe has kept this case alive for nearly a decade and will be in Court on May 2nd to see that the state's bill does not jeopardize Everglades restoration. "Judge Hoeveler has been overseeing the Everglades settlement agreement for over ten years.  The Tribe is pleased that he is concerned enough about the Everglades legislation that he has decided to expedite the hearing, so that it can be held before any legislation becomes effective.  The Judge clearly stated in his Order amending the original Consent Decree that adopted the EFA deadlines, that he did not expect any more delays. It appears from this Order that he meant what he said."

The Tribe, who has lived in the Florida Everglades for centuries is an acknowledged leader in the battle to stop pollution of its homeland.  It filed a motion to enforce the original settlement agreement in the Hoeveler case after the EFA was passed in 1994, and has been carefully scrutinizing the Everglades clean up effort in Court ever since. The Tribe, which is treated as a state under the Clean Water Act, was also the first to adopt a numeric 10 ppb water quality standard for phosphorous for its Everglades, which the EPA deemed protective. 

According to Miccosukee Tribal Chairman Billy Cypress, "Delay is the enemy of the Everglades.  Every year the state fails to provide the quality of water the Everglades needs to survive, more of it is destroyed.  Those pushing this destructive Everglades bill don't see the damage caused by the delay, but our members who live in the Everglades do. Our entire culture and way of life depend on the Everglades having clean water. We will not tolerate  more delay.  We will not let the Everglades, which is 'the world and life of the Miccosukee' people, die."

 Dear Gov. Bush, 
U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler -- who signed the intial Everglades
consent decree --  today scheduled an emergency hearing for May 2, writing
that he has been reading news coverage of the proposed legislation with
"considerable apprehension" and believes the Legislative action could affect
the Everglades consent decree.
 I'm hoping to get some comment from the DEP or your office.

Help Us Convince the Senate to Fund 
Statewide Economic Development!

E-mail or fax Senator Daniel Webster and ask him to adjust the Senate's 
budget for Enterprise Florida (EFI) to match the Governor's recommendation. 


Based on initial budget recommendations released by the Florida Legislature, Enterprise Florida (EFI), the state's innovative public-private economic development organization, could be in serious jeopardy.  Unlike the Governor and the House, who have recommended funding at near-continuation levels of approximately $11 million, the Senate has recommended that EFI receive approximately $6.6 million - a 40 percent reduction that threatens its very viability. 


Economic Development is Key to Florida's Future 


  <http://www.harvesthost.com/accounts/flcc2/ecast/images/arrow1.gif> 	Aggressive economic development programs like those employed by EFI play a pivotal role in diversifying the state's economy, and a more diverse economy will make Florida and our employers more resilient to economic downturns. 	
  <http://www.harvesthost.com/accounts/flcc2/ecast/images/arrow1.gif> 	Economic development creates high-value jobs and generates wealth in our communities. It also induces business investment, which accounted for nearly 18 percent ($2.984 billion) of Florida's sales tax collections last year.	

Click here to contact <http://www.votervoice.net/core.asp?IssueID=1717&sessionid=AID%3D136%3AASSOCNAME%3DFLChamber%3AASSOCIDNAME%3DFLChamber>  Senator Webster through our ChamberWatch Alert Center where you will find a letter ready to send.   Feel free to add your own personal comments and simply click "send."  Communicate how important Enterprise Florida is to our businesses and our economy and remind him that Enterprise Florida has consistently produced solid results for the state of Florida:

  <http://www.harvesthost.com/accounts/flcc2/ecast/images/arrow1.gif> 	An Ernst & Young study found a return on investment of $4.37 for every public dollar invested in EFI's programs and operations (FY 2001-02). 	
  <http://www.harvesthost.com/accounts/flcc2/ecast/images/arrow1.gif> 	EFI helped to facilitate projects that will result in 26,171 direct jobs and $1.6 billion in capital investment in Florida (FY 2001-02).	
  <http://www.harvesthost.com/accounts/flcc2/ecast/images/arrow1.gif> 	Despite an economic downturn that affected all of Florida's largest trading partners, EFI helped Florida companies export more than $600 million in products and services, which translates into more than 6,600 new jobs for Floridians (FY 2001-02).	

Programs that spur high-value job creation and capital investment are part of the solution to Florida' s budget crunch. It's more important than ever to fund our state's economic development efforts.  Thank you for your support.  If you have any questions, please call Sheri Green at (850) 521-1244.

many volunteers. I am proud to be one of them. Along with my fellow piers of William H. Turner Tech we had a great time. Being

of All-Aboard. I think you would have loved to have been there to share it with us, but knowing that you cared was good enough.

Scholarship Program Saves Taxpayers Money, Helps Low Income Children
A response to the Palm Beach Post Articles Dated April 23, 2003
700 Word Count 
I read with disappointment your articles attacking the state’s education scholarship program for low income children and me personally in the Palm Beach Post today. I hope you find it appropriate to share my response with your readers. 
In response to your inquiries regarding the program, my staff provided the factual information you requested, arranged interviews with educators in the program, and offered the opportunity to talk to parents participating in the program. While I was not tremendously surprised, I was disheartened to read that you chose to omit any information derived from these sources, and chose instead to highlight your opinions and speculations as the bulk of the stories. 
Some of the information that was provided to you, and then was disregarded in the story is as follows: 
*	The huge savings that the program would provide. Two credible research institutes - Florida TaxWatch and The Collins Center For Public Policy - have issued reports showing that the scholarship program saves taxpayers money. You also make no mention of the savings that come from reduced class sizes in public schools. 
*	A survey of approximately 400 schools in the program showing that 95% administer a nationally recognized standardized test such as the Stanford 9. Since you were provided this information, it remains a mystery as to why you chose to imply schools participating in the program do not use nationally recognized testing to measure educational achievements of students. 
*	The average household income of scholarship recipients is $20,000, and 60% of the students come from single parent homes. These parents have tremendous difficulty paying out of pocket expenses for uniforms, activities fees, transportation and other charges, which they must do. The entire premise for your suggestion that the program costs the state money, instead of saving it money, relied on your speculation that over 40% of the families that are on the program would have gone to private school anyway. This is absurd. 
*	The program has received 40,000 applications from low income parents its first year with little publicity. Are you not interested in why there is such incredible demand from these parents? 
Reporters at the Palm Beach Post interviewed, but declined to mention, two new schools that are doing a wonderful job serving the poorest children. One is a new school in Overtown started in a homeless shelter’s community center. The school’s founder, a Ph.D in education, described to you in detail how the school has saved the lives of its students, some who come from families with hardly any incomes at all. They even started a school newspaper—let’s hope they learn how to have the courage to report the truth. 
While my skin is thick, I feel it necessary to respond to your attacks on me personally. Regarding my “career change,” I was very fortunate and worked very hard to enjoy some business success in life. But when I learned five years ago that less than half of minority children in Florida graduate from high school, I felt compelled to help.  
We created a privately funded scholarship fund that offered to pay only part of tuition to 750 poor kids in Tampa Bay. I was stunned when we received 12,000 applications in four months with no publicity. When I received the heartbreaking letters from those who didn’t receive a scholarship, I decided to dedicate my life to helping them. I couldn’t ignore their voices. 
But somehow you can. Incredibly, you declined to talk to even a single low income parent using the program. Tomorrow more than one thousand parents and children will be in the capitol to show their gratitude to Florida’s elected leaders for their courage and commitment to improving education for low income children. They will have taken time off from their jobs to come from as far away as Tampa, Orlando and even Ft. Myers. They will come to talk of how they are empowered for the first time to make the best decision for their children, just like parents with more money do.  
Do you have the courage to talk to them? 
Sincerely, 
John F. Kirtley
President, Children First America

Mr. Governor:
 
Where is it written that government must pay for health care?  My parents, Alice and Dudley Eifert, died in there late 50's early 60's. Dad worked at Western Electric and was devastated when AT&T went on strike in the early 80's.  Dad paid over $350,000 into social security and never got a penny back! 
 
I was 2 months premature. Mom paid the doctor $10.00 a week for me for years! In fact, I doubt if she paid the final bill before the doctor retired. 
 
I learned in large class rooms in Pennsylvania and I went to a private college. I paid $43.20 / month for 10 years for my BA.  Moravian College charges $100,000 for four years, but with scholarships it can cost as little as $12,000 / year. 
 
When I grew up, we did not have bullet trains nor did we have 33% failure rate in high schools. 
 
What is wrong with society today? Keep the faith and tell The President, he is doing good!

I appreciate your email but disagree. Nothing that the ultimate bill that will pass the legislature will hold back on our historic progress on everglades restoration. In addition, the bill in front of the legislature regarding telecommunications will be harmful. The bill as presented will allow for the PSC to regulate local rates, will allow for the expansion of Lifeline and will expand competition in the areas of the industry that will promote jobs and economic development.

Subject: paper attached State of the Small Business Credit Market


Mr.  Bush,
 
Romerio requested I pass this paper on to you as a courtesy.  Knowledge is always important.  I was told by Dr. Philip Levine, that this is the latest version of their work. It was first released in 1998.  I don't believe the attached document has been released to date.  This is our correspondence, please keep in confidence.  Solutions for discrimination are usually based on incentives to all parties involved, as we see the progress in the mortgage loan market.  There is a 10%-13% denial rate for equally qualified minorities and all others which is very good in comparison.  Women have no problem in this area any longer.
 
I had problems getting financing for my company during the dot-com boom and I wanted to quantify (represent in a mathematical model) the subjective bias-race in the algorithm (model).  He said the variable that represent this data point would be very high in a credible model.  There is a 65% loan denial rate for equally qualified Black applicants.  All other groups are in the single digits.  I think it hovers around 25% denial.
 
He wrote:  
Omitted variable bias exists if a relevant factor that enters into loan

decisions and is correlated with race is not incorporated into an

econometric analysis.  For instance, suppose the econometric analysis does

not take into account the business owner's personal net worth.  Banks

could care a lot about this for a small business loan because if the

business fails (and failure rates for small businesses are high), the bank

could be repaid by the owner's personal resources rather than from the

business.  We also know that whites tend to have greater personal net

worth than blacks.  Therefore, if blacks that apply for loans have a

smaller personal net worth, on average, than whites, then banks would

legitimately reject more black loans.  This is not discrimination. 

Discrimination would only occur if two otherwise identical applicants were

treated differently because of their race and this is not the case in this

example.  In our work, we have done everything that we could to reduce the

likelihood of omitted variable bias and believe that we have convincingly

made the case that discrimination does exist.

 

As for the mechanism, there are elements of the loan process that are

subjective, like evaluating the firm's business plan.  Although we have no

evidence for this, my personal opinion is that loan officers' biases

unconsciously affect that evaluation, reducing the score of black

applicants and increasing denial rates for them.  This is not overt

discrimination, but it has the same impact in that blacks get denied more

than they would if they were white.  Again, this is just my opinion and

not based on any specific evidence.

Dear Gov. Bush,
    I met you at South Florida Commiunity College about a year ago.  I had my daughter Ruth Anne with me and you had a talk with her about her not liking school.  She is now home schooled and seems to be doing better.  The State Atty in town that always took her to school to make sure she made it on time is our new County Judge Peter Estrada.  You could not have picked a better man for the job. He will do great things for our county.  
     My main reason for the visit that day you were here was to try and get some help with my student loans that had gone out of control.  If you remember they went from $30,000 to 100.00 because my ex-husband did not want to pay them.  He spent the money on boats, cars and motorcycles just to name a few things.  He left me with 4 kids and I  don't have the money to pay them.  Everyone you told me to talk to kind of blew me off and in the end they are still coming after me for them.  
     Once again I am hoping that you and maybe your brother (being from Texas) could find some way just this once to forgive me for these loans so I can go on with my life and send my kids through college (with out loans!) although I know you are both VERY busy I am praying that you could  find in your heart to help me.  I have been in law enforcement for 31 years and have been as honorable a person as I can be.  This is just one problem no one seems to be able to help me with.  My ex-husband is now gone and I promise you I am never going to apply for another loan as long as I live!  I know that between you and President Bush and a lot of praying you are my only hope of getting out of this mess I got into while in school.  If I had not been a somewhat abused wife at the time and had stood up to my ex husband this never would have gone this far. 
Once again I beg the two of you to help me and forgive me of this loan.  What ever I can do for you in the future I would gladly do.
   Please do not forget me.

Subject:	Everglades Bill and Judge Hoeveler...

By now I am sure you have learned of Judge Hoeveler's order setting a
hearing on May 2nd, apparently due to his own concerns resulting from media
reports concerning the debate on this bill.  

The telling feature of Judge Hoeveler's Order issued today is his repeated
statement: " I do not propose to deviate from the settlement agreement that
now exists between the state government and the federal government".

The "settlement agreement" he references is the Amended Consent decree,
which embodies the current deadlines and structure of the Everglades
Forever Act. 

Jeb, when we met in your office this was the problem I was attempting to
inform you about. This is why Audubon has maintained in a steadfast manner
that the only acceptable way to consider amendments to the Everglades
Forever Act is to involve the U.S. Justice Department, Department of
Interior, and the Enviornmental Protection Agency in a transparent way, on
the front end of the development of legislation. 

The fact of Judge Hoeveler's intervention gives a sound and defensible
reason to now take steps to bring everyone to the same table. 

I would propose:

(a) Legislative leaders be advised that it is your desire that prior to
further legislative action, a summit with key federal representatives take
place.

(b) That those federal agency representatives, representatives of DEP, the
Governor's office, SFWMD, key environmental groups involved with this
legislation, the Miccosukee Tribe and the sugar industry discuss (together,
same room, same table) what, if any, amendments to the current Everglades
Forever Act might be appropriate.

(c) That this effort have as its primary target the development of a
consensus among the parties to the Amended Consent Decree, so that a united
state-federal agency position can be represented to Judge Hoeveler on May 2.

(d) That legislation be deferred until this consensus is attained,
recognizing that an extended Legislative Session, or Special sessions are
highly likely in the near future due to other unresolved legislative
issues.  It should also be recognized that three more legislative sessions
will transpire after this one PRIOR to ANY enforcable requiements of the
current Everglades Forever Act coming into play on Dec. 31, 2006.

As I have indicated in the past, we will be glad to cooperate with an
effort such as that outlined above.

I believe that the key federal representatives who should be invited are
Mr. Keith Saxe of the Justice Department, Ann Klee & Rock Salt of Interior,
Philip Ungaro and Regional Administrator Palmer of EPA Region IV.

Charles

Everglades pollution bill alarms U.S. judge 

BY LESLEY CLARK AND CURTIS MORGAN 
lclark@herald.com 

TALLAHASSEE -A push by Gov. Jeb Bush and the powerful sugar industry to loosen pollution standards in the Everglades could be challenged by a Miami federal judge, who said Wednesday the measure may threaten ongoing restoration efforts. 
In a strongly worded order, U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler demanded that the state appear in court to discuss the matter May 2, the same day the Legislature is scheduled to end its annual session. 
Citing Herald reports of the deal, Hoeveler said he views the proposal with ''considerable apprehension'' and twice noted in a four-paragraph order that he has no intention of abandoning a 1992 Everglades cleanup settlement agreement he orchestrated. 
''I think we should immediately have a hearing on this subject and you should make every effort to attend before this legislation becomes effective,'' Hoeveler wrote. 
The politically connected sugar industry has angered environmentalists and members of Congress from both parties in recent weeks with its aggressive efforts to convince the Republican-led Legislature to soften water-quality standards in the Everglades. 
The legislation has moved swiftly through House and Senate committees with little objection from either party, guided by a battalion of sugar industry lobbyists. 
The measures would push back enforcement deadlines for cleaning up the Everglades by at least seven years -- and the House version would boost the acceptable amount of one key pollutant by 50 percent or more. 
WELCOME NEWS 
Environmentalists and members of Congress have decried the effort, saying it endangers an $8 billion federal-state Everglades restoration effort. 
On Wednesday, those same critics viewed Hoeveler's order as an injection of reason into the debate. 
''I would hope the Legislature would put the brakes on this, realizing the federal courts are now concerned,'' said U.S. Rep. Clay Shaw, a Fort Lauderdale Republican who has urged his state counterparts to abandon the measure. 
The extent of the judge's legal authority to affect the legislation is unclear. The judge noted that the 1992 agreement extends only to federal land in the Everglades National Park and the Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge in Palm Beach County. The state insists it will meet the pollution cleanup deadlines in those places. 
A spokeswoman for Bush said the governor remains committed to Everglades restoration. 
''If this is going to become a legal issue, we're going to leave it up to the court,'' said Bush spokeswoman Alia Faraj. 
The state expected Hoeveler's interest and is prepared to defend the legislation, said a spokeswoman for the state Department of Environmental Protection. 
''We are in compliance with the consent decree and expect to remain in compliance,'' DEP spokeswoman Deena Wells said. 
Her words were echoed by Robert Coker, the senior vice president for U.S. Sugar Corp. 
''We are confident that at this hearing, facts will be presented showing that Everglades restoration is not only on schedule but substantially ahead of schedule,'' Coker said in a prepared statement. 
Charles Lee, vice president of Audubon of Florida, said the judge's surprise decision to schedule the hearing before the close of the legislative session sends a clear message to the sugar industry, lawmakers and the governor. 
The status hearing had originally been scheduled for June 10. 
'I think the words for the day are, `Here comes the judge,' '' Lee said. ``He clearly has the authority to step in and we're glad to see him step in where the state's leaders have failed to.'' 
As the federal judge who heard the landmark 1988 lawsuit by the federal government that forced the state to clean up polluted storm water flowing into the Everglades, Hoeveler has retained considerable clout over state water-quality standards. 
As recently as September, he held hearings on the cleanup at the request of the Miccosukee Tribe, which argued the state was lagging well behind a December 2006 deadline to clean up the Everglades and would not meet a super-low standard for phosphorus, a nutrient used in fertilizer. 
Most scientists believe phosphorus levels above 10 parts per billion would create a biological ripple that could change the Everglades: First, tiny organisms like algae die, then exotic plants oust natives like sawgrass and, finally, the altered habitat changes the wildlife. 
`ON TRACK' 
But Hoeveler declined to step in at that time, after receiving an upbeat assessment from the state agencies managing the cleanup, the South Florida Water Management District and the state DEP. 
''We are on track with complying with the settlement agreement performance measures,'' district attorney Ruth Clements told the judge then. 
Those agencies now predict it will take at least another 13 years to meet that standard throughout the entire Everglades, which is prompting the disputed legislation. The water district's governing board also had endorsed a push by the sugar industry to adopt a standard allowing up to 50 percent higher levels of phosphorus, or 15 parts per billion. 
Miccosukee attorney Dexter Lehtinen, who as U.S. attorney in Miami brought the original lawsuit against the state, said he was pleased with the judge's scrutiny. 
''It's obvious he's going to pay careful attention to it,'' Lehtinen said. 
John Fumero, the water district's chief legal counsel, said the district looked forward to appearing before the judge and would prove it was in ''substantial compliance'' with the settlement. 
While he admitted it would take the state years to clean some other areas, Fumero said cleanup was on schedule in the areas that Hoeveler oversees -- the national parks. 
''They have some of the cleanest water in the whole Everglades,'' he said.

Subject: Proposed funeral & cemetery legislation


Gov. Bush

HB495 by Rep. Brown and it's companion SB2016 by Sen. Pruitt which provides
for the abolishment of the Board of Funeral Directors & Embalmers at DBPR is
very controversial with funeral directors across the state and not in the
best interest
of the consumers of Florida. The majority of  funeral directors want to be
judged by their peers
and continue to be regulated by their own professional board that has
existed for many years.
They also want to continue having appointment of board members made directly
by the Governor.

Rep. Dennis Baxley and I are friends, however we disagree on this particular
issue.
Unfortunately he has a vote and I don't. I am getting calls daily from
funeral directors
across the state opposed to these bills.

Funeral directors also do not want to lose the 24/7 online licensing
capabilities and technology
advances made at DBPR with the reengineering project. Dept. of Financial
Services online
capablities are limited. The PUBLIC as well as licenses will be better
served at DBPR.
This proposed legislation which is being driven by powerful special
interests in the funeral
and cemetery business provides for more government and less personal
freedom. The professional
associations are divided and much disinformation is being put forth.

Rep. Detert's HB907 which was amended today onto Rep. Dean's HB1641 contains
consensus issues that are non controversial within the "death care industry"
and provides
for some needed legislation that is in the public interest.

HELP, please do what you can to support only Rep. Dean's HB 1641, otherwise
VETO is the word.

Dear Commissioner Horne,
 
I wanted to inform you about a new American government / leadership project that I am currently working on called "Ask Government"
 
The program is available to all schools across the country as a way for students to learn about and participate in their government as its happening.  The format will be an hour-long live webcast with senior leaders in the legislative, judicial and executive branches of the federal government.  Students will have the opportunity to ask questions about the branch of government as well as current events to the guest via email or phone.  Schools can currently register to participate at www.askgovernment.org
 
Unfortunately, we could not get this started sooner.  I know this would have been a great opportunity to have students' concerns and fears about Iraq and homeland security addressed by some senior members of the administration and congress. 
 
I am a Gulf Breeze High School, Florida alum and graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy.  After leaving the Navy, I went to work for an all news radio station in Washington, DC where the idea for "Ask Government" was spawned (along with some input and advice from my mother, Carolyn Dzombar--a social studies teacher in Florida).  We are relying on word-of-mouth to let schools and teachers know about this unique and exciting opportunity.  Any assistance you can provide that will help to include Florida schools in this opportunity would be greatly appreciated.  If you have any questions, comments or ideas, please do not hesitate to contact me at 301-648-9546 or bday@askgovernment.com
 
I want students to get excited about their government and I want them excited to learn about it.

Hi Jeb,
I have been hearing on the news where school disticts face large budget cuts. I have not heard them mention however, what huge cuts there will be in welfare. Are there going to be huge cuts in welfare? If not, why not?
Those who attend school are trying to make something of themselves. Those who sit all day and do nothing but smoke crack are not.
Why is it the ones who sit and do nothing face no cuts? 
Next is the high speed rail...what a joke! I agree this needs to be voted on again. The only other item I would like to see voted on would be who ever votes for a tax increase, let them be the ones to pay it. If 52% of the people vote for a tax increase, let that 52% pay it. I'm done with tax increases. If Joe Millionaire goes to the poll and votes for an increase, then Joe Millionaire needs to pay it. Is that not fair, letting those who vote for an increase be the one who pays it?

 Dear Governor Bush:

 I am a resident of Miami-Dade County, your home county, and staunch
 supporter of restoring the "River of Grass," the Everglades.  It would
 be a disgrace to our State to allow greed to derail the goal as expressed
 many times by Florida's citizens.

 I appreciate and thank you for your stated commitment to restoring
 America's Everglades. We need your leadership now to keep this vision
 possible. The recently approved legislation in Florida's legislature 
endangers
 this goal. Please veto any attempt to weaken the Everglades Forever Act.

 This bill, written by supporters of the sugar industry, is not what the
 Everglades needs. In fact, it delays and weakens the enforcement of
 water-quality standards, and delays the construction of new water
 treatment areas. The bill also puts the clean-up costs squarely on the
 shoulders of taxpayers like myself, in spite of the Constitutional
 amendment requiring polluters to pay for this clean-up.

 Please, I urge you, reject the sugar lobby's claims that its bill is 
reasonable.
 By weakening and delaying the standards, limiting the allowable cleanup
 tools, and rejecting the "polluter-pays" concept, this bill is a major
 threat to South Florida.

 Federal monies and Florida's taxpayers have already invested millions
 of dollars to help restore the Everglades. The state's willingness to
 adopt Big Sugar's bill that delays and weakens phosphorus clean-up
 will erode support for this historic project.   Please do not  endanger
 the $8 billion federal-state agreement, already in place, to clean 
 up the River of Grass.
 
 Do not endanger the future of the Everglades, please reject the sugar
 industry rewrite of the Everglades Forever Act.  Please do not listen to 
those 
 46 lobbyists hired by the sugar industry.

    Dear Sir, first off I would like to state I am honored by your immediate response to my letter to you yesterday, concerning my sister, Donna Brizedine. I also would like to apologize for being  so hasty in writing to you without finding out what disabilities my sister had. I just got off the phone with her and the following is what I found out. 
    Her husband Tom was upset with the VA in New Orleans that did not provide travel expenses to and from Foley, Alabama, their home. Donna is in the process of getting her records and her disabilities, in order, to go in front of the VA review board to plead her case for VA assistance. The results of her bodily tests should be back today or tomorrow and she has a psychological evaluation set for May 1st. The disabilities are as follows: hypertension, hardening of the arteries, these causing a failure of her right kidney and a stint had to be installed. Her regular doctor believes she has a very good case for the review board. I do not know. 
    Again I would like to thank you for your quick response, you sincere concern, and will let you know the Donna's results as soon as she receives them.

As you are aware, Governor Jeb Bush is requesting a $12.2 million increase in funding for Healthy Families Florida. Why? Because Healthy Families works. By providing in-home visitors to new parents, Healthy Families Sarasota has a proven record of success in keeping at-risk children and families out of the state’s child protection system. In Sarasota County, 98 percent of participating families have maintained healthy parent/child relationships and have stayed out of that system.

Child Development Center manages Healthy Families Sarasota. Its Family Support Workers are dedicated individuals who help more than 400 families each year in setting goals, learning effective parenting skills, and making plans for a happy and healthy future for both parents and children.

I hope I can count on your support for this important funding increase.

Hello Governor,
 
Here is a quick update:
 
HB 1687 - The DOS & DCA merger is on Approps today and should be on the floor early next week.
 
HB 119 - The in-state tuition / Education Access is very shaky.  Rep Kyle does not want to hear it in Approps (today is their last mtg) even though it passed its previous 4 Committee stops unanimously.  I have brought up the merit/urgency of this legislation to everyone in leadership to no avail.  Unless it gets withdrawn from Approps by tomorrow this bill in all likelyhood will die. Even if the Senate version comes over, if we haven't cleared the Approps hurdle, it wont go anywhere.
 
I believe the best hope this legislation has is for you to speak with Speaker Byrd and communicate to him the need for this legislation to be heard in a fair and open manner.  We need your help to get this over the goal line.
 
Un cordial saludo,
jcz

OPM launches program to diversify senior executive corps 
By Tanya N. Ballard  

To help increase diversity in the Senior Executive Service, the Office of Personnel Management has created a new program to help develop a more diverse pool of candidates for positions in the government's top management corps.   On Thursday, OPM Director Kay Coles James joined with Rep. Danny Davis, D-Ill., to unveil a new Senior Executive Service Candidate Development Program. SES members administer public programs at the top levels of the federal government. Positions are primarily managerial or supervisory and candidates undergo a rigorous selection process.  The new program will focus on training qualified women, minorities and people with disabilities to take on senior executive roles at agencies. After they complete the program participants will be placed in SES positions. Part of the impetus for the program came from reports by the General Accounting Office, which found that the SES was not representative of the workforce or the population, James said. A February report concluded that a pending retirement wave in the SES would provide an opportunity for agencies to diversify the senior executive pool.

Jeb, 
Apparently Mr. Horne has access to a crystal ball there in Tallahassee that we 
aren't privy to here.  None of us, including the School Board know anything about all that classroom accountability you shared with me.  For example; FCAT scores have gone DOWN in Marion County in about 80% of the categories (as compared with 
State averages) since Warford became Supt. here.  Regarding CIM (Cont.Imp.Model) 
only half my children's teachers are even doing it.  Maybe you didn't see ALL the negative newspaper articles about how the Curriculum administrators had issued tests that didn't even match the weekly work or the answer sheet for teachers had the WRONG answers.  Therein lies the reason we need Dr. Evelyn Kelly (college professor and author of  articles ON CURRICULUM ) as interim Supt. to clean this mess up.  OBVIOUSLY, since Mr. Horne was all excited at the press conf. about Warford he knows something GREAT about this year's FCAT scores we don't know yet.   I look forward to those improved scores (as compared to the State improvement not just a look at us alone) because I have eaten a lot of crow from people ticked off with me for persuading them to vote for Warford.  My name has been mud. If the scores finally went up I will be thrilled so I can carry my head proudly around here again.  I realize Jim's a GREAT speaker (like those AMWAY motivational folks on info. commercials)  but you gotta put legs to it to impress me. 
God bless Mr. Horne if he's finally got some results vs talk out of Marion County.   I look forward to seeing those improved scores!   I sure have prayed enough for good scores! 

Hope your family is doing well.  Personally, I think we should build our schools on the moon and send all children there at age 16 until they are 21.  I'm sure they would 
probably sniff moon dust to get high then?  My oldest son is at UCF - will be a senior in engineering next year.  However, I could write a book about some of the stunts he pulled that has made my head spin round and round.  He got into some SERIOUS trouble the same day Noel got into trouble about a year ago.  He didn't tell us but a friend phoned me three days later asking if I knew?  Rocky and I went flying in to Major's room to confront him and he said "When I walked in the day I got into trouble I overheard you and Dad feeling sorry for Mr. Jeb for what his daughter had done.  I 
KNEW I could not tell you I got into  BIG trouble (needed a lawyer) on the very SAME day as her!  Almost all the wonderul Godly men in the Bible had trouble with their kids!  Major has gotten back on the right track but the last two years were not fun with him.  He is even about to join the Young Republicans at UCF.  His fraternity is quite patriotic so he's surrounded by good influences.  Us parents must be in constant prayer for one another.

Tom Daschle's Duty to Be Morally Coherent 
A Weekly Standard Exclusive: The Senate minority leader is ordered to stop calling himself a Catholic. 
by J. Bottum 
04/17/2003 12:00:00 PM 


TOM DASCHLE may no longer call himself a Catholic. The Senate minority leader and the highest ranking Democrat in Washington has been sent a letter by his home diocese of Sioux Falls, sources in South Dakota have told The Weekly Standard, directing him to remove from his congressional biography and campaign documents all references to his standing as a member of the Catholic Church. This isn't exactly excommunication--which is unnecessary, in any case, since Daschle made himself ineligible for communion almost 20 years ago with his divorce and remarriage to a Washington lobbyist. The directive from Sioux Falls' Bishop Robert Carlson is rather something less than excommunication--and, at the same time, something more: a declaration that Tom Daschle's religious identification constitutes, in technical Catholic vocabulary, a grave public scandal. He was brought up as a Catholic, and he may still be in some sort of genuine mental and spiritual relation to the Church. Who besides his confessor could say? But Daschle's consistent political opposition to Catholic teachings on moral issues--abortion, in particular--has made him such a problem for ordinary churchgoers that the Church must deny him the use of the word "Catholic." Much of the discussion about Daschle's standing has gone on in private over the last few years, although Bishop Carlson and Senator Daschle had a very public spat about partial-birth abortion in 1997. During the run-up to a Senate vote on the issue, Daschle proposed what he called a "compromise," banning the procedure while allowing exemptions for any woman who claimed mental or physical health reasons for having such a late-term procedure. Pointing out the way the exemptions gutted the ban, Carlson called Daschle's proposed compromise a "smokescreen" designed solely to "provide cover for pro-abortion senators and President Clinton, who wanted to avoid a veto confrontation." Daschle, in turn, rose on the floor of the Senate in Washington to denounce his own bishop back in South Dakota for speaking in a way "more identified with the radical right than with thoughtful religious leadership." Carlson later told the Sioux Falls Argus Leader that he remains mystified by Daschle's position on abortion. "NARAL claims him as one of their number-one supporters. I don't understand how he can be in touch with South Dakotans as much as he is, and yet consistently have a pro-abortion record." This year, on January 16, Bishop Carlson received additional ammunition for his discussions with Daschle when Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger's office, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, issued in Rome a "Doctrinal Note" on Catholics in political life. "A well-formed Christian conscience," the note declared, "does not permit one to vote for a political program or an individual law which contradicts the fundamental contents of faith and morals." The Doctrinal Note marks at least the beginning of the end of the Vatican's toleration of what the pope's biographer George Weigel has called "Cuomoism" in the American Church: the effort to finesse abortion by declaring oneself personally opposed but politically supportive of laws allowing abortion. Catholics have a "duty to be morally coherent," the Doctrinal Note declares, and the Catholic fight on the life issues--abortion, euthanasia, and cloning--is not some merely prudential question, to be decided by political give and take. The Catholic Church doesn't take political positions--except when politics intrudes into something, like the right to life, that ought to be beyond the power of politicians. Bishop William Weigand of Sacramento was the first American bishop to use the new note from Rome. At a pro-life Mass on January 22, he spoke of California Governor Gray Davis's claim to be a "pro-choice Catholic." After describing the efforts by Davis's pastor to get the governor to see the moral incoherence of his position, Weigand declared, "As your bishop, I have to say clearly that anyone--politician or otherwise--who thinks it is acceptable for a Catholic to be pro-abortion is in very great error, puts his or her soul at risk, and is not in good standing with the Church. Such a person should have the integrity to acknowledge this and choose of his own volition to abstain from receiving Holy Communion until he has a change of heart." (Russ Lopez, a spokesman for Davis, responded with the hilarious and deeply revealing complaint that Bishop Weigand was "telling the faithful how to practice their faith." In Lopez's mind--as, indeed, in the minds of many--the promise of the separation of Church and state, in which no political figure gets to tell believers how to practice their faith, has turned into a need for the separation of Church and Church, in which not even a religious figure gets to tell believers how to practice their faith.) There's quite a list of pro-abortion Catholics in Washington--beginning with Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic minority leader in the House--who could use similar instruction in "the duty to be morally coherent." Just in the Senate, there's Biden, Collins, Daschle, Dodd, Harkin, Kennedy, Kerry, Landrieu, Leahy, Mikulski, Murray, Reed, and more. But at least Tom Daschle has now been forced by Bishop Carlson to assume some responsibility for moral coherence--even if it is, unfortunately, a coherence achieved in the wrong direction. The diocese in Sioux Falls would not say what brought the issue of Tom Daschle's Catholicism to a head at this moment, although one South Dakotan suggested it may have to do with Daschle's crossing of yet another line recently when he began direct fund-raising for NARAL. Senator Daschle's office has not yet responded to a request for comment. It's a serious thing when a bishop breaks a pastoral relation, no matter how tenuous that relation may have grown. But Bishop Carlson is right that the time has come to banish Cuomoism from American politics. This isn't a matter of favoring Republicans or Democrats. Regardless of their party, public figures who aren't going to oppose abortion shouldn't call themselves Catholic anymore. A native of South Dakota, J.

Governor Bush:

It is my pleasure to recommend to you Jim Yancey for the position of Superintendent of Schools for Marion County.

During the two years that Mr. Yancey has served as Deputy Superintendent I have found it a pleasure to work with him.  As Chairman of the School Board during that time I found that he honestly and accurately replied to requests for information and that he carried out the decisions and directions of the School Board with the real intent of the School Board in mind.  He has also brought numerous recommendations to the Board that have helped to meet the Board's goal of leading the State in student performance.

Mr. Yancey has a long career in public education moving through the ranks until just before his appointment as Deputy Superintendent serving as the Principal for the largest high school in Marion County.

I strongly believe that Jim Yancey would be a good choice to fill the remaining term as Superintendent of Schools for Marion County.

Dear Mr. Bush,
    Marion County School Board superintendent Jim Warford has recently
been appointed to a position in the educational leadership of the State of 
Florida. Our county is faced with an interim superintendent until election
time comes. I am writing to recommend the placement of our current
assistant superintendent of Marion County, Jim Yancey, to this position. 
   Mr. Yancey has been active in Marion County schools for many years.
He has always been an advocate for constant student growth and 
achievement. The teachers that have had the privilege to work with him 
can tell that he is also an strong teacher advocate. This is something that
I feel our county is in need of. We all are working toward the goal of high
standards for student achievement and would like very much to have a superintendent that recognizes our efforts.
    I have been a teacher in Marion County for eight years. My position is currently the Teacher of the Gifted Program at Reddick-Collier Elementary. The students that I work with deserve an appropriate education just as any child in the public school system needs. I feel that Mr. Yancey respects these needs.
    A school system is only as good as the people that work within that system. We have some excellent schools, with excellent teachers. Please help us to maintain and push forward with the goal of "all students can achieve" by appointing Mr. Jim Yancey as interim superintendent for Marion County. 
 
Sincerely,
Mrs. Kelly Mickel Hubner
Teacher of the Gifted
Reddick-Collier Elementary

Dear Jeb and staff:

This school safety matter noted in the Orlando media has been a problem that has continued for the duration of your entire time in office. Frank Brogan was responsible for the changes in State law that allowed storage rooms to be used as classrooms and Lt. Gov Toni Jennings the Sen President was a part of the reason that legislation passed.

A review of the current record in Tort law and government accountability will reveal that you as Governor and your Executive staff are liable under Civil Rights Laws and Constitutional Law for their failure to enforce state legal standards on subordinate elected officers such as the Dade and Orange Co. school Districts.

The state fire marshal and the Commissioner of Education are looking at personal tort liability under changing case law that may make their years of documented non action actionable in tort as individuals for school children's injury due to their failure to insist on enforcing state school safety laws protecting millions of Fla school children.

Current litigation in the recent lounge deaths by fire is seeking to broaden this individual liability to include elected officials who failed to act to enforce state law.

No action plan from schools




By Mary Shanklin, Mark Schlueb and Leslie Postal
Sentinel Staff Writers

April 24, 2003

Orange County school officials scrambled Wednesday to eliminate hundreds of fire hazards, but county fire inspectors say they're still not moving fast enough to protect children.

Focusing on the most easily fixed problems first, school security officials called for installing fire alarms and adding strobes and other warning devices where they are missing or broken. But the schools have yet to produce a firm timetable for dealing with more substantial issues, and officials continued to express confusion about the magnitude of the crisis.

The words and actions came after Orange County's fire marshal recommended sections of some schools be shut down if "serious life-safety hazards" weren't resolved.

A review of county inspection reports showed, for instance, that 25 schools didn't have working emergency windows, including nine that didn't have any window exits at all. At Sadler Elementary alone, 28 classrooms had windows that could not be used as emergency exits.

In other cases, school driveways aren't wide enough to accommodate fire trucks, and fire hydrants are blocked.

Such fundamental fire-safety problems have festered in a system that for decades has allowed Orange and other school districts to police themselves. Until January, the law let districts conduct their own safety inspections and report violations only to other school personnel.

Fire officials said school buildings that house hundreds of children each day deserve the same level of fundamental safety as shopping malls, restaurants and offices.

The School Board is expected to discuss the situation at a workshop Tuesday. School Board Chairman Rick Roach said he wanted to reassure everyone that the schools are safe.

"My initial and immediate concern, from a parent's perspective, is, 'Are our children safe?' " Roach said. "That I can feel comfortable with."

But Orange County officials said some of the problems are very serious and need to be addressed as soon as possible.

"I am very concerned about this situation. They have the responsibility to ensure the safety of children, and they need to step up and accept that responsibility," said Orange County fire Chief Carl Plaugher, who has been working with the district on resolving the issues for more than six months.

"It's a very serious matter and it needs to be attended to quickly."

The chairman said he was not sure which buildings had problems serious enough to warrant closing portions of them.

"That part is hard to understand," Roach said.

He and other school leaders insisted backup safety systems were in place to assure no student's life would be endangered in case of fire.

"If something fails, we have a backup," Roach said. He pointed to monthly fire drills, student head counts and multiple warning systems.

No action plan from schools

Orange County Fire Marshal Daniel Kucik said he and his counterparts at the state level haven't received the school district's action plan for dealing with the district's most egregious code violations.

"We are still waiting for a response from the school district with concrete dates," Kucik said Wednesday. "If we don't get the plan and the dates, all bets are off."

Jim Goodloe, chief of Florida's Fire Prevention Bureau, requested a copy of the district's plan Wednesday. If Orange County inspectors aren't satisfied with what they get, they could ask state officials to shut down sections of schools where dangerous conditions haven't been addressed.

But "if the plan of corrective action is satisfactory to the county, then there's no need for us to get involved," Goodloe said.

Building codes changed

In addition to shifts in inspection responsibilities, the district encountered a new set of statewide building codes this year, said Pat Herron, Orange County's school facilities director.

It is like watching a worker paint a yellow line on a curb while a car is parked next to it and a policeman comes along and tickets the vehicle, Herron said.

The district and the county began working together on inspections six months before required. The Fire Marshal's Office finished its initial review of schools in unincorporated Orange County last summer, finding numerous "life and fire-safety" problems.

The problems included classrooms converted from storage areas, unsafe cooking equipment and portable classrooms so close together that a fire could spread quickly from one to another.

Substantial corrections made

The district tackled many of the problems, and in November the Fire Marshal's Office noted "substantial corrections."

Fire Marshal Kucik wrote a Nov. 25 letter praising the district's efforts and saying he was "confident that the appropriate safety measures have and are being implemented to satisfy the deficiencies identified."

Problems were not fixed

The good feelings didn't last, though. A new round of inspections, detailed in letters this spring, found a host of violations, many of them of the same type and at the same schools cited last year.

In July, for example, Aloma Elementary School was cited for not having proper emergency windows. It was cited this month for the same problem.

In an April 4 letter, a frustrated Kucik said the district's "inability to terminate past practices . . . multiply the fire code violations daily." He said the district had to provide a "plan of action" within 30 days of receiving his letter.

District officials pointed to a safety plan they developed in recent years based on annual school inspections by district employees. The plan ranks 1,309 safety violations that will cost more than $5.7 million to fix. About $2 million has been budgeted for those repairs.

Some problems cited by the fire marshal were not included and school security director Rick Harris said employees might have missed some things.

"If the fire marshal found something, then we should have found it," he said.

Harris said he applauded Kucik's office for such thorough work and said the district is trying to respond to concerns.

On April 11, Harris wrote the county explaining that an "immediate action response program" was being set up requiring school administrators to correct some problems, if possible, within 72 hours.

Among the plans is a "fast track" system to correct the numerous problems with inadequate exits, the letter said.

Some parents said they were worried about unsafe conditions.

Donna Barley said she was concerned about the safety of her son, who attends the Magnolia School, a school for severely mentally disabled students. The county Fire Marshal's Office cited the school for a lack of fire sprinklers in nine rooms. Barley said that's disconcerting -- many of Magnolia's students are in wheelchairs.

"As the parents, we would certainly want to know," she said. "It does take a longer time to take the children out because they just can't get out on their own."

Barley, vice president of the school's PTA, said she had never heard the sprinkler issue discussed.

"This is the first I've heard anything about it," she said.

Subject: Hello from Robin Safley
Governor, I hope this note finds you well or as well as can be expected with the legislature in town.  I wanted to share with you a project that I am working with and ask for your support.  It is titled Labels for Literacy and is a project of the American Action Fund for Blind Children and Adults and is supported by the National Federation of the Blind and many other individuals and organizations.  On the other side of my government service it was real important for me to dedicate my time to a cause that at the end of the day would truly make a difference and in this project I have found that.  Labels for Literacy is a program designed to make products more accessible to the visually impaired community and put more Braille within the everyday reach of children to assist in combating an extremely low Braille literacy rate.  Since 1963, the percentage of legally blind children using Braille which is their primary reading medium has dropped from 51% to 10%.  The studies show that this is not due to a lack of learning potential among blind children, but rather a lack of resources and Braille material available to them.  
 
Prior to agreeing to work with this project I did my own check and spoke with Craig Kiser, Division Director of Blind Services, who happens to be blind to determine if this was a viable concern?  To my dismay, it truly is and not just for children.  Blind adults desperately want more Braille, it is just amazing.  Although the advancements in technology have helped them in their daily lives a great deal, it can not ultimately take away the need to read.  Just like us, listening is not literacy, and the lack of Braille in their environment limits them.  
 
Now of course I thought of No Child Left Behind.  It would assist so much if someone with your passion and commitment began to speak about the importance of Braille and your encouragement of making Braille more readily available.  I have spoken with Kathleen, Mary Laura and Liza.  They have all been and are being very supportive.  I just wanted to touch base with you personally, so that you would understand my enthusiasm.  Kathleen has some brochures on the program.  The brochures are geared to consumer goods companies and labels for their products however after talking with Craig Kiser there is a need that is even greater.  Hurricane maps, books, brochures, museums….the list is endless.  Your leadership could truly make a difference.  
 
Thanks,
 
Robin

Governor:
First, thank you for the confidence you, and Commissioner Horne, have placed in me. Now I must urge you to move as quickly as possible to appoint Deputy Supt. Jim Yancey to replace me upon my resignation. The quicker the better. As I've told you, Jim Yancey is a Republican who is absolutely committed to your goals. As superintendent, he will stay on our message and stand up for us. Carolyn Roberts has a long history with him. Most importantly, Yancey is the only person who can keep Marion Co. on the right path. If Evelyn Kelly were appointed, the wheels will come off this school system.  Community and business leaders will distance themselves and all we've done will unravel. Kelly is being put forward by a vocal, but radical, group with a very personal agenda. She has neither the vision or ability to fill this critical job. Carolyn Roberts has a long history with this family.

Jeb, Marion County is very fortunate to have not one, Jim Warford, but two, Jim Yancey, very qualified gentlemen  running our school system. It would be in the best interest of our county for you to appoint Jim Yancey to fill the very large void left by Jim Warford. That move is also Florida's gain. I've known Jim since 1970 in our football playing days back at the University of Florida. He has a wonderful family and has family values that parallel the Bush family. He is the most qualified to carry on the programs that Jim Warford has implemented. At first these were not very popular but are slowly being accepted. I have voted for your both times around and I know you will do what's best for Florida and Marion County. As a side note, Your brother, our President is the greatest!!

Honorable Señor Gobernador Bush;
Es para mi un verdadero placer, y tambien un privilegio dirigirme a Ud., aunque se que quizás no sea Ud. quien  lea este correo electronico.  Quiero decirle que es Ud. para nosotros un ejemplo y una inspiracion a mi vida y la de muchos que conozco.  
El motivo deeste es que yo estoy cursando el doctorado en teología y divinidades y viendo como Ud. siempre se ha tomado la molestia de visitar las cárceles y aún eventos llevados a cabo
bien sea para recaudar fondos o alguna celebración, creo que Ud. si puede ayudarme.
Yo no le estoy pidiendo donaciones.  Solo le pido que se me de una oportunidad para poner en practica
lo que Mi Señor me ha concedido.
Primeramente, vivo en el condado de Palm Beach.  Ahi hay un porcentaje de hispanos muy alto y yo he
estado donando mi tiempo, o sea, como voluntaria en las carceles del Palm Beach Sheriffs Office.  Por ahora, estoy como "Bilingual Coordinator"; desde 1993.  Ha habido una posicion para "Senior Chaplain" y se le ha otorgado al Capellán asistente que ahora tiene aproximadamente un año de estar trabajandoalli.
Yo no espero que le quiten una posicion a una persona para darmela a mi, pero habiendo enviado mi resumé y llenado una aplicacion creo que por lo menos me hubieran entrevistado.  Yo no envie la aplicacion antes, porque decia que estaban entrevistando personas que ya estuvieran dentro o sea,
que estuvieran trabajando ya con ellos.  Cosa que yo se que cualificaba porque aunque era trabajo voluntario estaba ahi por 10 años.  Yo necesito trabajar en lo que se que puedo hacer.  A mi me ofrecieron trabajo pero de "clerical" y yo de oficina no tengo experiencia.  
yo pense que no tenia oportunidad, lo cual espere para enviar mi resume y la aplicacion.
Ahora bien, mi deseo es que ud. me ayude para que este departamento tan siquiera me considere y
me den la oportunidad para una entrevista.  Yo soy una persona preparada y se que puedo hacer mi trabajo muy bien, porque la experiencia la tengo y la preparacion tambien.  Sin dejar de mencionar Que soy un ministro con credenciales para capellania y se como llegar y manejar cualquier situacion que se ofrezca. 
Tambien ahora mismo no tienen en el departamento de Clero a nadie trabajando ahi a tiempo completo.  Todos los dia que yo voy, los reclusos estan esperando con ansias que alguien llegue a su
ayuda.  A mi me da mucha pena porque cuando uno esta de voluntario no tiene la misma libertad.
Bueno, mi Honorable Gobernador, me despido suplicandole ayuda.  Una carta de recomendacion o una llamada se harian la diferencia.
Ellos dicen que no tienen posicion pero se necesita una persona bilingual y si ellos desearan podian hacer una posicion para mi.
Le di toda la informacion del doctorado, y credenciales para que ud. entendiera mi preparacion.  No importa que este sobre-cualificada.  Si ellos desearan ayudar a esos reclusos, me podian dar a mi esa oportunidad.
Un millon de gracias. Que Dios nuestro Padre Celestial sea con ud. y los suyos.

Subject:	Fw: Sugar Plum [In the end, the tensions between the two Bush administrations could work to the president's advantage.] (The New Republic, 4/24/03)

Governor Bush ... below is what I consider an accurate and balanced article
... an excellent synopsis of the current dilemma we face in Everglades
restoration ... I'm sure I'm not privy to everything but, with what I know,
I just can't figure out why one would risk committing political hara-kiri
over what, even though portrayed by some as catastrophe, is in reality
rather insignificant ... the sky seems to be always falling to consummate
devil's advocates who want to preclude even the possibility of the event
with the .0000000001 percent probability from occurring ... ignoring the
impact on many others ... if we are to be successful in Everglades
restoration, our imperative is to seek and implement reasonable, balanced
solutions and I can assure you that your present course of action is not
one.  Following the standard procedures of the Clean Water Act would have
been the prudent and painless course of action ... still is and I am
confident that there are ways to do it that make sense for everyone
involved.  Why toss away all the credit for all the good work done to date
in cleaning up the water? Why throw us back into the litigious quagmire???
If you would articulate your reasons and strategy then maybe we would have a
chance to understand ... until then your course of action is sure to remain
a total mystery to many ... and a catalyst for great controversy.

I recommend that you put the proposed legislation off for at least a year
... keep striving to meet the Dec 31, 2006 deadline and establish a
Governor's Commission of all the relevant interests and force it to come to
agreement on a reasonable and prudent course of action for satisfying the
requirements of the Clean Water Act ... I honestly believe that the prudent
decision at this point is postponement followed by balanced debate and,
hopefully, consensus.  Trust me, where this is headed is not good for anyone
... we need a timeout and your the only one who can call it at this point.

Sincerely,

Terry

Governor,
Thank you so much for forwarding this request to your schedulers. I did hear from Carolyn King and fully understand the demands of your schedule will not allow you to attend.
Is there a  possibility that you can send a letter to be read at the dinner showing your support for all the foundation does to not only recognize the importance of the healthcare field, but encourage our young citizens to choose it as a career. As well as recognizing the outstanding nurses in their fields.
Thank you again for all you do.
All my best,

Governor,
We in Palm Beach County have a very exciting event taking place May 8-9. This will be a two day nursing expo to address the nursing shortage hitting our country, state and county. 
Palm Healthcare Foundation, a not-for-profit, community healthcare foundation is dedicated to the good health of Palm Beach County. Its mission is to raise and distribute funds for healthcare programs, projects and services in our community and is presenting this event.
The expo was created to recognize the nursing professionals as well as students entering this field.
Palm Healthcare Foundation has awarded  numerous scholarships to students every year and envisions this expo to be a vehicle to garner more students in the healthcare industry.
The event will be capped off by a dinner and awards ceremony  titled "Celebration of Nursing. Lifting Spirits...Touching Lives".
If you happen to be in Palm Beach County on May 9 we would love for you to attend the dinner and encourage those in nursing and those entering the profession to continue their exceptional work.
Knowing how hectic your schedule is, I'm sure those attending would be thrilled to receive a letter commending Palm Healthcare Foundation,  the outstanding nurses and healthcare professionals.
I would greatly appreciate anything you can do to show them your support.
All my best,
Kathy

Dear Governor Bush: 
    The Sadowski Affordable Housing Act is very special to me.  Not just 
because it is named in honor of my husband but because it has assisted so 
many hard working citizens of our state with affordable home ownership and 
rental housing.
    I know this is a difficult budget year and that all funds are being 
carefully scrutinized.  As I sat down to write this e-mail I thought about a 
comment from your inaugural address calling on all Floridians to help others 
and to nurture our families and our communities.  This program truly answers 
your call.
    Governor, please reconsider your position regarding this trust fund and 
urge the House members to retain the dedicated documentary stamp revenues in 
the affordable housing fund.
                
                                        Sincerely,
                                        Jean Sadowski

From: AUSLEY.LORANNE@myfloridahouse.com 
Sent from the Internet (Details) 


I am thrilled to report to you that today the Governor signed HB 1739 .  As you may recall, under this legislation, students with a documented disability and an IEP who have completed their coursework, but have not passed the FCAT after two tries (in 10th and 11th grades) will be eligible for a standard diploma, if their IEP committee determines that the FCAT does not accurately measure the student's abilities.  This bill is effective as of today.  This is quite a victory for these students, so we need to make sure that all those who can take advantage of this new law are aware of it.
 
Please pass the word, and we will provide any additional information as we receive it.
 
Thanks for your hard work on this issue - I know we would not have been successful without the many calls, letters, visits and emails all of you have made to your elected officials.  We still have much more work to do to address all of the challenges faced by people with disabilities in Florida, but we can be proud of our accomplishments for this legislative session.

Subject:	Healthy Families Florida

Governor Bush,
 
I would like to express my strong support for your proposal to increase Healthy Families' funding by 12 million dollars so that we prevent thousands of children and families from ending up in the system.  It will cost all Floridians much more money if these families have to be referred to other programs within the state.
 
There is no doubt that Healthy Families works.  The latest results from an independent evaluator show that Healthy Families is working to prevent abuse - 98% percent of the children served had no child maltreatment within 12 months after the family completed the program.
 
As a citizen and resident of Miami-Dade County, I applaud your commitment to the children and families in our community that are the most needy and desperately rely on the services that Healthy Families provide.
 
Best Regards,
Oren Wunderman, Ph.D.

Attached in Word is the proviso language from last year.  I have also attached a draft of proposed language for the 2003 proviso language.  I have no pride of authorship and the 2003 proposed language is for your review and comment.  We need to have agreed upon language submitted as soon as possible.  I suggest we meet at Representative Sorensen's office at 9 AM tomorrow, April 25th to finalize the language.

The changes include providing for deposit in the Florida Keys & Key West Areas Trust Fund if the bill passes.  If the bill does not pass, DEP will be charge of distributing the funds.  The funds will be distributed in accordance with the proviso language.  The dates of compliance are changed to March 1, 2004.  I used percentages instead of dollar figures.  I am assuming the funds will be distributed 25% each.  I eliminated distribution to Layton and Key Colony Beach.  If I am in error in this regard, let me know. All the other verbiage from 2002 should be the same.

I understand what you are saying but what are the expenses now and projected as well as deficiencies in growth from the rest of the countries economic slowdown.  I understand that we are getting somewhere in the neighborhood of 3800 new families moving to this state a month but tourism has and will continue to slow down with the economy then the coffers will dry up and once again to keep the police, teachers, firemen and other public assets they will require more in the form salary and raises than are on the table.  Teaching for example is not a hot job topic because the pay is bad and I know this because I am around them.  I know Sheriffs pay is bad why because I know cops and talk with cops.  I did not even mention the mandatory class size and pre I requirement, where is that money coming from along with the bullet train.  That is a lot of stuff and if the budget is growing like you said why are there the cuts that are getting ready to take place.  ---- Original Message -----

Thank you Ron. Interestingly, the legislature is about to reach an agreement on a budget which will grow by close to $2 billion. The K-12 portion of the budget will grow by over 6%. I didn't see the news so I don't know what cuts are being referred to but my guess is that the legislature will fund a per student increase during these tough times. Unfortunately, much of that increase will go to lowering class sizes in lieu of incresased pay.

Good evening Governor.  My name is Ron Reid from Tampa and I just saw the proposed cuts in education on my local news.  I am on a local SAC committee with one in school and another one on the way to school in two years.  I must say although I appreciate your valiant efforts to turn back the thought of  taxes at every turn.  The game is over and it is now time to initiate a state tax.  There is no other way, the economy is a nightmare and is not going to get any better anytime soon, revenues are down, homeland security costs are up, teachers and cops salaries are pathetic and in reality it is not cheap to live down here in Florida anymore.  I believe it is time to stop pussyfooting around and play it like the Marines in going straight to Baghdad.  This state government needs to get straight to the point and go with a state tax.  I know it will be ugly but so is the thought of laid off workers and workers continuing to work without raises and decent compensation.  Hey if you can fill the coffers then you can get creative in stopping the legislators from turning the needed windfall into pork barrel projects.    Thank you for being reachable.  Ron Reid

To: The Honorable Gov. Bush
Dear Gov. Bush:
I know that this is a very hard year for you with the economy and all the 
things that everyone wants from the government.  And I am also asking 
something of you.
When you are allocating money and putting it in the different funds, please 
continue to fund the Med Waiver program for developmental services.  You 
promised when you were elected that you would help these individuals and 
many have been helped.  However, there has been no movement on the med 
waiver list for several years.
My grandson, William Roberts, Jr. (Billy) is autistic.  He is 8 years old.  
He has been on the med waiver list for 3 years. His parents divorced 6 years 
ago and in order for Billy to receive treatments he needs I had to 
remortgage my home.  Billy has insurance and it pays some but again, my 
daughter has had to fight every step of the way to get coverage and it will 
not cover behavioral therapy at all which is one of the things these 
children need so badly.
Please, please fund the med waiver services for individuals that need it.  
Also, support the Autism Insurance Bill as insurance and government should 
work together on these needs.
Thank you.

Dear Mr. Governor Bush:
Please support the Garcia Ammendment, the homosexual agenda needs to be stoped.
God did not create homosexuals, God and us Christians love the homosexual as
a person, but not what they practice, it's an abomination, it's a sin and God

The main reason for this e mail is to request your support for one of our most dedicated Republicans in his quest for appointment to the Board of Pilot Commissioners. 
 
Don Molitor has served as an elected official on the Cape Canaveral Port Authority from 1994 until 2002. Don's knowledge and dedication to the  maritime industry is only equal to his dedication to his Family and Community.

I know that you view the mentorship of our youngsters as a very important mission.  That's one reason I decided to become a mentor.
 
I know this is a busy time of year for you, but I was hoping you could find time to autograph a photo of yourself for Kenny as a congratulations for making the Honor Roll.  I know it would mean a lot to him.

thank you for writing. The session is not finished so I don't know what the ultimate policy will be. The internet program will cost less than what it takes to educate a student in a tradional public school, so I don't think that it is an outrage. I do think that students taking advantage of the K-8 proposal should take the FCAT.
 
I don't agree with cutting arts programs. My record has been consistent in this regrard. However, if students want to accelerate their education and gain a degree quicker, with higher standards (as the bill requires), so that they can go on to college, we should not hold them back. That will not stop schools from continuing to have arts and sports programs which are very important. 
 
YOur school district (I am assuming you go to school in the three or four school districts impacted, but I don't know since you didn't say where you go to school) has not used all of the taxing authority available to it. Its class sizes are therefore higher than others. The amendment that passed requires lower class sizes. I support creative ways to implement the amendment like the ones mentioned above. 
 
I appreciate your writing me.

Dear Mr. Jeb Bush,
     I am an 8th grade student at one of your "A" schools. I have just read the news paper and read that a voucher program is going to allow kindergarten - 8th grade students to stay at home and go to school on the Internet. This doesn't really bother me, but what does is that my parents taxes are going to be paying them 4,800. That's an outrage! Furthermore, how do you really no that the kids are doing the work, there unattended.
      Another situation i don't understand is about the public schools loosing there electives, and extra curriculum activities well i am going to high school next year, and I wish to excel in there marching band/concert band. When I heard that they might be cutting the 7th period I was crushed! Don't you know that most students earn scholarships from sports and electives? Some times sports and clubs are students only motivation to go to school. I predict that the drop out rate will immensely increase that's defiantly not good!
     Would you please tell me why we have money to pay students to have "virtual school" and pay them to go to private schools, but we don't have enough money for 7th periods, and poorly schools (public schools). 
       I vehemently urge to read this letter, and think about some of the things it says
   please write back

Subject: I'm a $10,000 bonus teacher


My name is Mary Monroe and I'm a $10,000 bonus teacher who transferred to "F" school (Forest Hill High School) to help with FCAT Reading scores. I teach 9th grade intensive reading and intensive language arts. I am deeply concerned about the state of education today:
1.  First, the time restriction you put on 9th graders for the FCAT reading test severely hinders their success. There were given (I believe) 50 minutes for 54 questions. That's less than 1 minute per question without the reading time even allowed. I taught my students excellent reading comprehension skills, including visualizing, underlining, key concepts, re-reading and much more. Because of your background in ESOL, you should realize that students who are new to this country even more than two years REQUIRE MORE TIME IN READING AN D PROCESSING INFORMATION. Why not end the time restraints and SAVE MONEY and the disgrace of LABELING students FAILURES, which is a stigma that is VERY HARD TO OVERCOME. You also LABEL SCHOOLS and this is EXTREMELY DAMAGING.
Now I read in the paper that your legislature is "broke" and students will have to go without electives, band, sports and the "essentials" that make school rewarding while you give parents $4,800 VOUCHERS for their kids to stay home and go to school on the internet or to private schools that do NOT MEET THE STANDARDS OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS, yet are automatically considered BETTER! One of the benchmarks in FCAT reading is to recognize faulty and invalid premises and your educational plan is full of invalid suppositions. 

I challenge you to come to a school you labeled an "F" and see how these students struggle against unfair odds. They are from all countries -- Cuba, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Haiti -- AND THEY NEED PROCESSING TIME. Since the FCAT is a CRITERION-REFERENCED TEST, time should NOT be a factor.

I would be happy to be on a teacher panel that could tell you exactly how it is in the "trenches" of our public schools. My sister is Pat Striska and brother-in-law is Joe Striska, of the Florida Campground Association. They recently had lunch with you. 

The state of education is based on a faulty premise -- these kids need time to read and process. Why rush them? We allow them unlimited time after they "fail." Why do we feel it necessary to label people?

With everything in education falling down around you, do you like to be called an "F" governor? With lack of money for basic services, inequities abounding, faulty premises and much more, your A plus plan is a failure.

Throwing money at education is not the panacea for the social problems of the parents.  If we do not legislate to stop rewarding poor choices in society, we will not have improvement ever.  
 
If a mother with two children in an elementary school signs a piece of paper stating that she can not afford to feed her children breakfast or lunch, and then continues to have five more children by five different men, none of whom she ever intended to marry or get financial support from, it makes it exponentially difficult to educate her children.  Where is the responsibility factor?  Where are the consequences to her choices?  Where are the standards?   Where's the birth control in exchange for the meals?  It's only logical.  If you don't think so, please send some of your young family members to attend these schools and see if you don't change your mind.  
 
When your family member is sitting in a classroom with crack babies bouncing off the walls, screaming, yelling, jumping out of windows from the second floor, throwing things at the teacher, threatening to slit the teacher's throat and shoot her dead, I hope you will change your mind.  Please come visit.  I'd love to arrange a special tour, the real tour, not the dog and pony show that schools give you.

Subject: First Serve Tennis Program


Dear Governor Bush, I emailed you a couple of weeks ago to ask for your support by attending a tennis practice at Fourth Avenue Recreation Center for under-privilege kids in the First Serve Tennis Program.  Fourth Avenue, which is the newest site in Tallahassee for the First Serve program that you kicked off last February at Jake Gaither, has well more than 25 eager participants.  These children are so anxious to meet you in person and have you watch them play so they can feel a sense of pride in their on court accomplishments.  They have been playing since October 1 of last year at Fourth Avenue and since February 1 at Jake Gaither and are quite enthusiastic about improving their skills.  As a result of the First Serve Program, a number of these children have improved their grades in school as well as their behaviors on and of the court.   In addition, some of these children have gained much needed self-respect which I feel is pertinent in order for them to achieve in life despite their environment.
 
I would sincerely appreciate it if you would find some time in your very hectic schedule to come out and meet with these children one day after school before school actually lets out on May 29th.   Please have one of your staff contact me when your schedule permits you to come to Fourth Avenue between the hours of 3:30 - 5:30 p.m., Monday through Thursday.  
 
I appreciate the support your have given to this very viable program and hope that you will consider coming out to meet the children.

I have great concern and we are filing affidavits but my wider concern is
for the people that live here in my community. If this is a place where
stray dogs are taken  and serve as a lost and found under animal control
they should have to follow the same rules and laws the rest of us. who is to
say they won't keep other peoples dogs away from them. Many of the people
who wanted to speak out were actually afraid if they did this woman would
hurt them in some way.
I just think we need some clear rules here.

Subject: I'm not sure how this can happen


Sorry to bother you
We have an issue down here. I'llkeep it short and to the point.
A fews years ago the City of Boca gave our local animal control away to a
rescue group called Tri-County Rescue whichis a private non profit group. I
found it very sad that instead of pulling together a bunch of rescues and
ask them to work together this one group got it.
I basically stay away from these folks. I get a bad feeling fromthe people
that run the place. I know they stole a dog from a house in jupiter. and I
also was called there one day to take a golden that a depressed woman
brought in and her husband went the next day to get the dog back. They
wanted me to get the dog out of town and I refused. They went on and on
about how the mentally ill should not have dogs -just really ignorant
people.
I have had volunteers tell me that when a lost dog is brought in they take
off the collar and they believe that if you've lost your pet you do not
deserve to get it back.
Thats the big picture-because here I am spending all this time talking to
people about microchips.
Now according to the Palm beach County Commissioners office -even though
they function as a lost and found for the county basically they can do what
they want if they get a stray dog.
Which means if one of my dogs get lost they have no responsiblity even if he
has a microchip to call me and tell me they have my dog.
The immediate issue is a homeless veteran name William -he had a dog named
Brownie who wandered away from their campsite.
I'll never forget William after Sept 11- standing on his corner dressed in
red white and blue. i wish I had taken a picture because he broke my heart.
Anyway Tri-county has Brownie and they will not give him back. Brownie was
Williams constant companion. He was a lost dog found in Hialeah and I dare
say they have saved each others life.
There was a local story and a few of us have stepped forward to help.
Me, the jewish librael, Chauntel a canadian who is a volunteer for the local
palm beach county police and 3 people from Christ the rock Church.
We have asked that Brownie have an independent exam because the shelter
clams he had many medical issues.
We have offered and made our offer known that we are willing to set up an
account at a local vet for Brownies vet care.
A bunch of us gave William the 70 dollars orginally to get his dog back but
because he did not have a tag they said he could not claim ownership.
we have a lawyer and we have signed affidavits that  we can identify Brownie
as his dog.
I think we are being good neighbors and good citizens.
Heres what I think
I think that all stray dogs should go to animal controls and not shelters
and be kept for the requisite days.
I think this place needs to be repremanded in a bog way to be so mean to a
man. They basically came out said the homeless should not have pets and also
the mentally ill.
( I as a practice place pets with depressed folks because its good for them
and gives them a purpose)
thanks for your time
I hope your family is well.

Governor:

I again offer this advice, as unwelcome as it may be.  This continued, predicted divisiveness is bad for everyone. 

"My advice on this issue has been freely given from the start of the Legislative session, but the process leading up to this bill pre-dates that by some time, as you know.  I've been quite consistent in predicting where this would end up, and, unfortunately, that's where it seems to be going.  I would still strongly suggest pulling the plug and getting back to objectivity and science: call on rational, objective thinkers and they will respond to a well-formulated alternative to this needless legislation.  Let's not end-run the public process that got us this far in Everglades restoration."

You can still step back and urge both sides to achieve resolution, where noone else can do so.  Starting negotiations from the original form this bill was never going to get us there, but starting from where we all previously were could.

Regards,

Stuart

I have been viewing the HERALD coverage of the proposed legislation by the
State with considerable apprehension. I do not propose to deviate from the

legislature which may indeed affect the settlement.

I think we should immediately have a hearing on this subject and you should
make every effort to attend before this legislation becomes effective.

Again, I say that I do not propose to deviate from the settlement
agreement. Now I cannot control what the parties do as to the other parts
of the Everglades, but the National Parks are and will be controlled by the
settlement and amendments thereto which have been memorialized in the
settlement decree. I would like to propose a hearing immediately and

Dear Governor Bush,

I wanted to take a moment to let you know about a grassroots organization I started in Miami, FL called eMail Our Military. We’ve been proudly supporting our service members since the Gulf War in 1991 and would love any advice or assistance you can provide so that Floridians can assist us in sending and showing support to our military service members.

eMail our Military was created as a response to the DoD’s cancellation of the “Any Service Member” mail programs in 2001. eMail Our Military provides a safe way for people to continue the tradition of "Any Service Member" mail with a much more personal touch. It’s an opportunity to let America's military know how much we appreciate what they do on our behalf 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.

We're currently supporting the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, National Guard and Coast Guard and have been doing so since the Gulf War in 1991! After September 11th, it was suggested we take our campaign to the internet to allow people all over the world to join us in supporting our troops. If possible, we'd love to get the word out to Floridians so they can join our campaign and send a message of support.

Our campaign is hugely successful and we’re fortunate enough to say we are currently working with Disney and super model Estelle Reyna to get care packages and mail to our troops. We hope Floridians will find eMOM a place to support America's troops, show their Pride in America, and as President Bush suggested, get involved in the effort here at home. We’ve been so successful in fact that we now have a location in Newport News, VA near our largest Naval base but we still need help.

  

To Learn More About the eMOM Campaign, please visit:  <file://www.eMailOurMilitary.com> www.eMailOurMilitary.com on the web

I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

Dear Governor Bush,

   I know you are in support of Healthy Families Florida and strongly care for the welfare of the children of this state. As the Program Manager of Healthy Families Clay and as a citizen of St. Johns county who supported you in your re-election,  I command you for all your efforts to fully fund the Healthy Families Programs statewide by including $ 12 million in expansion funds in this year's budget.

   As you know, Healthy Families Florida is the only statewide prevention program that has solid research to demonstrate its effectiveness regarding children growing up nurtured, parent's moving toward self-sufficiency, and families becoming empowered to create safer and healthier homes for Florida's adults of tomorrow.

   I urge you to continue to advocate for additional funding by convincing Senators and Representatives of the worthwhile and urgent cause to keep Florida's children safe and their families prospering. In these times of economic hardships it is understandably more difficult to show support for a variety of good causes but Florida's children cannot wait!  I have great confidence in your leadership and thank you for being Healthy Families Florida's most powerful advocate.

Jeb,

Thought I'd follow up on an earlier note I sent about Manatee. I was very
disappointed this past Easter Sunday.  After service at the First Baptist of
Cocoa I over heard a conversation from some of our youth. It was a beautiful
day and in past years there had been outings to Ski Island. Seems this year
the Manatee Zones have eliminated this very healthy recreational outlet for
our youth. Eventhough the Manatee and skiers have coexisted in this area for
years.  My point again is that the Manatee Zones are restricting healthy
outlets for our youth and are NOT a significant benefit to the Manatee
population.

Letter to the Editor, St. Petersburg Times

Dear Opinion Editor and Jeb Bush,

Even California, Texas, Illinois and Florida papers and radio shows are
highlighting that Pinellas County (6th Judicial Circuit) is Florida's
most corrupt county.

We urgently need a federal special prosecutor like you requested and
named for Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach...... these counties are
Disney World when compared to corrupt Pinellas County.

This police and judicial corruption "infection" started in Pinellas
County when most of the county commissioners were in jail.....now rogue
police officers are murdering us and battering us without any meaningful
Internal Affairs investigations or punishment... "our complaints.... all
unfounded" as we are bleeding and bruised or dead.... (this is no joke).  

Other counties put these felonious criminals wearing badges in
prison.... not in Pinellas County they don't.  The unholy criminal
alliance between corrupt Pinellas law enforcement, a corrupt "do
nothing" State Attorney and a corrupt "cover-up" judiciary makes a
tightly knit Pinellas County criminal enterprise of repeat official
offenders with no accountability.

Unlike the killer infection, SARS, you, as Florida's Governor can stop
this killer infectious Police Corruption and the continued Judicial and
County Official's crime spree with just a phone call and a stroke of
your pen...... Please take action today as both infections are just as
fatal to the public's civil rights and lives.

The people who voted you into office are being regularly battered and
threatened on a daily basis by an abusive and oppressive government and
threatened by "law enforcement thugs" if we dare to expose these crimes
to the governor or the media.  Even our free speech is being censored at
public county meetings under threat of battery and arrest.  

If you will protect our lives and families, we will provide your Special
Prosecutor Task Force with "names and proof"...... we need our
governor's action now.

Dear Governor Bush,

I would like to thank you for your support of the Healthy Families Program.  I became involved with Healthy Families for a very personal reason.  I had the experience of taking in a pregnant teenager who's family had kicked her out because she was pregnant.  I lived with her and saw first hand the potential for this young girl to become an abusive parent and a burden on society.  With the help and support of my family she finished school,took parenting classes, got proper medical care and gave birth to a healthy baby girl.  This young woman is now a loving, self sufficient mother of a beautiful 3 year old girl.  I
shudder to think what might have become of her and her baby if she had been left alone,abandoned by her family and with no one who cared about her or her child.    

When I heard about Healthy Families and what the program did for these kinds of women and families I had to get involved.  Since that time I have become aware of just how much this program is needed.  How cost effective this program is for the state and the country and how many young lives it affects.  I get to see first hand the success of this program and I am happy to be part of it.  

I hope you will continue to support this program and increase the funding for this program so it can continue to expand.  There are so many more families that need the help and support of Healthy Families.  Each time I hear a story on the news about a child being shaken to death or being abused I think, that could have been prevented if Healthy Families had been in that home.  

Please put the state funds were it will do the most good,
in prevention.  If you can build a strong family from the very start then there won't be a need for crisis intervention later.  The statistics prove this program works and is the most cost effective program available.  I hope you will continue to support this program.

The ongoing destruction of the everglades is unconscionable and should be stopped. 
One of the reasons I voted for you was because I thought I could trust you to restore the everglades

Don't let the sugar industry, which is largely responsible for the destruction, stop the restoration for another

Dear Governor Bush -

I am writing to you to ask you to VETO the pending legislation that is being pushed by the sugar industry.  I believe that if passed it would 1) delay the cleanup of the Everglades until the year 2026 and 2) increase the allowable levels of pollution which is now set at 10 parts per billion. Florida stands to lose the Federal Government's 50% share of the $8.4 billion cost of cleanup if the delay and the phosphorus pollution level is allowed to go through. US Representatives from Florida, Clay Shaw (R) and Porter Goss (R) have called the bill "flawed."

Dear Jeb,
       Good afternoon! I am writing to let you know I will be going to Washington, DC. I will be receiving the prestigious award The Latina Leader of the Year for the State of Florida 2003. I also will be a speaker on the issues of crime, Juvenile Delinquency, justices and human trafficking. 
       
       Two weeks ago I was involve in the rescue of a Hispanic girl kidnaped four years ago in Sarasota County. With my coordination and the incredible speed of the FBI, we rescue a Cuban girl from Yucatan Mexico. Looks like we do have other victims from the state of Florida and this cannot be allowed. 
      
        I have been trying to meet with Mel Martinez because I need a center for the Hispanic Community in Sarasota. I call Paul Sharff the Chairman of the Republican Party in Manatee County, because Mel will be there tomorrow morning. This man is an undesirable and unscrupulous man who the party should not have as a representative.
       
        We, Hispanics have the right and obligation to participate in the elected process and run for any office that we think is proper and makes changes to enhance the need of our state. He lack the sophistication and culture diversity that our party needs. By attacking me, he made a big mistake. My legion is to children and focusing on Hispanic girls age 9-16. I will d what is deem and honest to due. His close mind and discrimination against women and Hispanic will eventually will come and hunt him.
       
        I will be pursuing to write a letter to the Manatee Republican Party and publish it in the newspaper. He should never insult or try to think he is the most powerful man or more important. I have a say, I must live today as if tomorrow would be my last day in Paradise. In addition he should be humble since when he dies he will receive the same recompense as everyone else. "Los gusanos" 
       I thought you would like to know. I am not going to tolerate any abuse or descrimination for the simple fact that I dare to do what many people talks about doing and will never dare. It is my duty and obligation to put light where darness exist. As always God bless you and take care. After returning from DC I would like to have a meeting with you.

Hi, it's Carissa again.  I am sorry to bug you, but this time the favor is for me.  My ex and his girlfriend are continually harrassing me by email and making threats as well.  They are continually breaking terms of service and the privacy policy of yahoo and hotmail services.  My ex's girlfriend continually makes up fake ID's and fake children and comes into the yahoo groups that I'm in in order to nose into my life.   They continually stalk me on the internet and make slandering comments about me.  It's been a never ending battle with these two for I think about eight months now.  My ex has got his girlfriend brainwashed so much that he lies to her and tells her lies about me so that she'll do as he asks.  My ex is a very controlling, manipulative, abusive in every way individual.  I'm sick of my privacy being invaded and my feelings not being accounted for.  I have been run out of three yahoo groups online because the owners choose to keep her in the group even though I was there first.  I know that may sound childish, but her reason for being in the group is not to be an active member, but to harrass me and slander me.   She is taking on many yahoo ID's in order to trick yahoo group owners and lies about her life and her kids.  If you could please help me with this, I'd be forever greatful!  Her name is Jessica Cartier and his name is William Komar and they live in Glen Aubrey, NY.  I will be calling attorneys Monday morning about all of this to see who will help me.  I have very little money, so I'm hoping someone will help me pro-bono.  I would like to file harrassment, slander and internet stalking charges against them both and possibly win a restraining order against them as well.  I have a son by William, but William and I were never married and there are no court arrangements for custody or visitations.  I have been told by his psychiatrist that it is in the best interest of my son that it stays this way.  I'm the custodial parent and William only pays child support every three or four months and doesn't even pay all that is owed to me and he also still owes the State of Florida money as well.  Like I said, I would like this resolved as soon as possible as it is causing stress in my family.  Both Jessica and William have made threats to three other yahoo group owners as well.  I would appreciate all you can do for me!
Your Cousin,
Carissa

Dear Governor,

Updating you:

I was officially rejected by the Park Patrol again today.  For the past 6 months I have been trying to find out exactly why I have been rejected and all I get is a "run around."  No one will provide me with a straight forward honest answer and it getting very frustrating.

I have put a concerted effort into getting back into law enforcement.  I moved to Florida 3 years ago -- had to be a resident for one year before I was eligible to take the EOT Law Enforcement class which I did -- passing with grades in the 90's and now that I'm certified it's impossible to attain a position in law enforcement  which is absolutely ridiculous during this time of national concern.

The only job I have been able to get is as a "greeter" at Burlington Coat Factory and I lost that position three weeks ago due to cut backs.

I feel I have been unfairly evaluated.  I bring a substantial amount of useful qualifications and talents to the table but these attributes seemed to be over looked.

My attorneys are strongly advising me to contact the media and initiate a law suit. (Gee what a surprise there.)  

However, since you already are looking into this important matter I wanted to make sure I did nothing to bring any negative publicity to you or our party.  

I have aspirations of running for office in the future and the last thing I need to do now is "shoot myself in the foot."

So, I will sit tight and wait to hear from you.

Thanking you again for your time and consideration in this very Important  personal matter.

Sincerely yours,

Hello Jeb, hope everything is well with you and your family. My family and I
are fine and today we are leaving for a mini-Disney vacation to celebrate my
son's 4th b-day. A little bit here a little bit there to help the Florida
economy. Anyhow, I was invited to the May 9th 38th annual Federal Employee
of the year luncheon. The person inviting me knows how highly I think of you
and mentioned you were the guest speaker. I am planning on anttendig but
have to manage my hours. The invitation states 11AM to 1PM with reality
check of 2PM. Since I am a contractor and don't get paid if I am not
actually working I wanted to arrive close to a time you think you will be
giving your speach. If this is at all possible and doesn't violate any
security rules please let me know.Otherwise I will do my best to show up
around noon.

Speaking of being a contractor, I must thank God that the USPS extened my
contract to September. I would have been out of a job by now. I have been
looking for a job all over the world (no kidding) since September of last
year. It is not like I don't have credentials. I have a Master's degree,
several high-tech computer certifications and am even a professor at the
University. I have even done everything regarding State contracts from
getting minority certified to erolling in myfloridamarketplace.com, Ariba,
Epylon, SPURS, DMS you name it I am there registered and legit. I really
don't have the capital to sell goods to the State so I registered more for
Computer services and more specifially I am looking for year to year
contracts or more for my services but I have not seen any bids come through
my email. The ones I do see have "Single Source" and are preassigned. I also
interviewed with John Ford and David who were representing the State
Technology Office (STO) for a project management position related to
converting the State over to Cisco Voice over IP (VOIP). Last I checked
everything was still in the process. So I was wondering, it is my
understanding that the rebuilding of Iraq will require a new high-tech super
highway infrastucture and they will be needing brave engineers to work and
rebuild the computer infrastreucture. Do you know anyone who might hire for
this or a way for me to bid a single source individual (myself) to be part
of a larger team. I'm not afraid to work!

God Bless, your friend,

Hi Jeb,

Thought you would be interested in this from Gun Owners of America web site.
BTW, that guy you said would be contacting me about finding legislative
history has never called nor emailed me.

As Semi-auto Issue Heats Up...
Official denials, attacks and silence abound

"The president supports the [semi-auto ban], and he supports reauthorization
of the current law" -- White House spokesman Scott McClellan (The Washington
Post, 4-12-03)


Tuesday, April 22, 2003

Hats off to all of you who took action last week in response to the White
House's distressing announcement.

After GOA alerted activists like you, we saw almost 10,000 e-mails generated
to the White House IN THE FIRST 24 HOURS ALONE.

Many websites posted the GOA alert, and Internet news agencies picked up
GOA's message as well.

WorldNetDaily.com ran with the story and quoted GOA's Executive Director as
saying that this ban was "anti-Constitution and anti-homeland security"
since these guns are clearly protected by the Second Amendment.

The Brady Campaign responded by attacking GOA as a "radical gun group" that
was calling for these guns to be "legal and available to all."

How ironic. Aren't they the "radicals" who are out of step with the American
people?

After all, the overwhelming majority of the American people correctly view
the Second Amendment as safeguarding an individual right. The Brady Bunch
doesn't think it does.

Meanwhile, a poll on the KeepandBearArms.com website reports that 90% of the
respondents will NOT vote for President Bush in 2004 if he signs a bill
reauthorizing the 1994 Clinton-Feinstein ban.

This would not be a surprise. Former President Clinton found out just how
unpopular this semi-auto ban was when he lost control of the Congress as a
result of it.

"The fight for the assault-weapons ban cost 20 members their seats in
Congress," he told the Cleveland Plain Dealer after the election, and is
"the reason the Republicans control the House."

Well, he almost got it right. The real number of Congressmen who lost their
seats because of that ban was over 60, according to the Dec/Jan 1995 issue
of Campaigns & Elections magazine. And contrary to Clinton's assertion, the
semi-auto ban doesn't cover real assault weapons at all.

Poor guy... Clinton never could get his facts straight.

But he was right about one thing. The ban did cost him control of the
Congress as gun owners abandoned the Democratic Party in droves.

Understandably, the recent Bush administration announcement has touched a
sensitive nerve in the pro-gun community.

Knight Ridder and The Washington Post carried the above statement by White
House spokesman Scott McClellan, and a mini-firestorm has resulted.

Some have speculated that with the President riding very high in the polls
as a result of the war, the White House was using the opportunity to reveal
its support for a very unpopular gun ban.

This may explain the timing of the announcement. Regardless, the official
response from the White House has been less than encouraging.

Some of you reported that White House operators accused callers of not
knowing what they were talking about -- that there was no Scott McClellan at
the White House and that no such announcement had been made.

(Yes, Scott McClellan is a spokesman for the White House; and you can read
the original news story at
http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A11013-2003Apr11 on the Internet.
McClellan's official title is: White House Deputy Press Secretary.)

Others reported that White House staff would not discuss your concerns
unless you could give them the exact law number or the exact section from
the US Code. We have provided the White House with the appropriate
information, so hopefully that won't be a problem anymore.

ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR ACTION:
Last week's GOA alert has resulted in thousands upon thousands of e-mails
going to the President. There is still no official retraction from the White
House, however.

If you haven't sent the pre-written e-mail to President Bush yet, please go
to http://www.gunowners.org/activism.htm to do so. For those of you desiring
additional ways to contact the President regarding the semi-auto ban, you
can use the following information to call, fax or snail mail him:

The Family That Eats Together ...
By RACHEL M. ANDERSON
Tribune correspondent 
 
Monica VanLandingham, 30, of Belleair leads a busy life. She has a husband, two kids and a rapidly expanding business, but she still makes the effort to sit down for dinner with her family every night. 
``Eating together gives our family a chance to reconnect after being apart all day,'' VanLandingham says. 
 
VanLandingham owns and operates two Playtime Express child-parent play-group centers, one in St. Petersburg and the other in Dunedin. She and her husband, Ken, are parents to 3-year-old Jacob and 21- month-old Max. 
 
``As busy as we are, it's hard to sit down for dinner every night,'' she says. ``But we make the effort because it's a good time to catch up.'' 
 
The VanLandinghams are part of a growing trend that shows family dinners are coming back into style. According to a New York Times/CBS News survey of parents, 46 percent ate dinner as a family during the previous seven nights. Also, every family ate dinner together an average of five times a week. 
 
A 1979 survey indicated the average American family ate together three nights a week. 
 
The VanLandinghams stick to a format. One ritual includes asking Jacob to tell Daddy what his favorite part of the day is. 
 
``Jacob really likes it when the conversation revolves around him,'' VanLandingham says. 
 
Cathy Griggs, 49, of Plant City says her family has a longstanding tradition of eating together. 
 
``It's a good time to catch up, for everybody to get on the same page.'' 
 
But it isn't always easy. Griggs, her husband, Paul, and their 18-year-old daughter, Katie, are constantly on the go. 
 
Cathy is a sales representative for Unisource, a paper distribution company in Tampa, Paul is a teacher at Lithia Springs Elementary and Katie is a senior in the International Baccalaureate Program at King High School in Tampa. 
 
Katie also runs cross country and track, participates in the thespians and Girl Scouts and is a member of National Honor Society. 
 
``Since we're all so busy, we don't get to see too much of each other during the day. Dinner time is when we catch up and get our family time in,'' Katie says. ``We typically discuss how our days went and current events.'' 
 
Katie's brother, Christopher, 21, ate at home nearly every night, too, before leaving for college. He is a junior at Emory University in Atlanta. 
 
Jean Winchell, 48, of Brandon comes from a large family and says eating together is a tradition she grew up with. 
 
Her oldest daughter, Stephanie, 17, talks about her dance recitals, friends, school and work. Jena, 14, talks about friends, school and how she did in soccer practice. 
 
``Dinner time is when we really get to connect as a family,'' Winchell says. 
 
Leading a busy life is no excuse for not sitting together for a meal, says Lian Dolan, a 38- year-old mother of two in Pasadena, Calif., who co-hosts a national radio show with her four sisters. 
 
Dolan also writes books and is a spokeswoman for Hamburger Helper, but she still manages to find time to eat dinner with her husband, Berick Treidler, and sons Brookes, 7, and Colin, 5, almost every day. 
 
``Families are so busy these says,'' Dolan says. ``It's easy to dismiss dinner as too much effort, but it doesn't have to be. 
 
``You can just pop something in the oven and while dinner is cooking, go do other things,'' she says. ``Just so long as when dinner is ready, everyone sits down together.'' 
 
Dolan says she learned the importance of the family meal through her own upbringing as the youngest of eight children. 
 
Dolan says she has great memories of sitting at the table as a young kid and ``just learning about life. I enjoyed listening to my older brothers and sisters tell stories about their experiences.'' 
 
Today, Dolan and her sisters, Julie, Liz, Sheila and Monica, share their childhood experiences with radio listeners. 
 
They talk about how family time around the dinner table should just be about family. No TV. No phones. Nothing but a shared meal and a little small talk. 
 
``Let your children talk to you without any other distractions,'' Dolan says. ``Make dinner time just about them and conversation.''

Dear Honorable Governor Jeb Bush,
I am writing you concerning the appointment of a "new" Superintendent of Schools to finish out the term for our outgoing superintendent Jim Warford. I have known Mrs. Evelyn Kelly for many years and I believe she is even more qualified than our outgoing superintendent Warford.  Mrs. Kelly taught both of my sons in Jr. High and she is far more approachable than Mr. Warford.  We need someone in office that will be more compassionate about our children and their education. Someone who will make themselves available to parents who have a true concern about schools and school policies here in Marion County.  WE desperately need an "Educator and not a coach" to represent the school board here in Marion County. For the future generations of Marion County and for the educators here, put Evelyn Kelly in office and watch this educational community flourish!  I honestly  think you will never regret putting Evelyn Kelly in that position. She is a super teacher and she would make an EXCELLENT SUPERINTENDENT!!!!

Dear Jeb,

 

You may have been reading about a charter school in Brevard that is imploding on itself.  I have visited, and am trying to assist gently without enabling.  There really is a philosophical question about whether or not to throw good money to bad.  Any thoughts on this you may have would be welcome.  In fact any thoughts you have on the charter school movement in general would be appreciated.  I just want to be sure we (Commissioner, you and I) are all on the same page.

 

On a separate note, I spoke to Sarah with regard to Dennis.  She has not found anything yet, but is hopeful.   I like Tallahassee and look forward to the whole family being together again.  In fact this weekend, being the Greek Orthodox Easter, my family has come up to Tallahassee to be with me:-)

 

Many Blessings,

Alex

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I would like to tell you about my 2 year old grandson,Kevin.He has cerebral palsy. His brain injury was do to a birth injury. He cannot use his hands or legs,speak or able to feed himself.My daughter is unable to work. Kevin is a full time job.His injury is due to repositioning him, when the doctor should have performed a c- section for delivery. 
Your proposal for a $250,000 cap on doctors, for people to receive for an injury as severe as my grandson, is a drop in the bucket for what it cost for Kevin's care and health insurance for the rest of his life. Not to mention my daughter and husband's life. When someone is neglectful,someone should pay, and $250,000 just doesn't do it.
It is like a crime. I don't say they should get several millions of dollars. But a cap of 1 million is more reasonable.
You are protecting bad doctors in the state of Florida. It would be best to weed out the bad physicians out of practice. Good doctors have to pay higher malpractice insurance rates to cover for the so called bad doctors. THE BAD DOCTORS ARE STILL WORKING IN THERE FIELD.. GET RID OF THEM!
Mr. Bush, I voted for you and thought you were for the people of Florida. I am finding out differently.
My daughter,husband and Kevin were at the Orlando conference,for the handicap last year, they sat in the first row,you were there. How could you stand there and support all the programs you are not weeding out the bad physicians that should be practicing. My grandson Kevin would not need these programs if it were not for a certain doctor who did wrong in the past. 
My daughter has to pay out of pocket for many of Kevin's services. You saw Kevin in Orlando. If you saw him again,he is one beautiful child, you would have to change your mind on putting a cap of $250,000 on a malpractice insurance. My daughter and Kevin deserve more. I would like you to walk in my daughter and Kevin's shoes, they deserve better.
 
Thank you,

I am pleased to share with you that the TD Commission just completed an exhaustive and national search for a new executive director. 
 
The Commission was fortunate to find one of its own to fit the job needs and address the challenges of the future. Therefore, I am pleased to share that we hired your appointee Mr. John Stanley to replace JoAnne Hutchinson on April 25, 2003. 
 
That also means we now have a new position open on the Commission for the Community Transportation Coordinator slot.  I would be happy to work with your appointment staff and apply my understanding of the system to help you select a new replacement for Mr. Stanley.
 
Sincerely your soldier,

Hello, Gov. Bush:

As I understand it, the net effect of these bills, should they ever get to your desk, would be to make law the DSM manual and to open the door to arbitrary arrest and detention.
The US Congress has already repudiated the DSM manual as unscientific.
And our Constitution is intended to protect us from arbitrary arrest and detention.
Please don't allow the psychiatric lobby to make their manual law or to move their practitioners above the law.

Dear Jeb:

I have had all weekend to think about these letters my agency received.  I still am stunned as to the action taken by the Department of Corrections.  At Walton Correctional Institution, C1756, we received the highest success rating for the State of Florida in the annual report.  Our last audit which was totally random and was only one month ago, we received a 97%.  Pam Denmark visited our program a few months back and told our program director and the Warden that we had a good therapuetic community program.

The only program the Department of Corrections had any questions regarding was the C1931, the Mental Health program.  So why would we lose all 3 programs when only one had issues?  This sounds like racial discrimination.  We have always handled our problems without ever going to this level.  Sorry, but this is what it feels like.

Dear Jeb,
 
I'm sure the battle for tax dollars is really intensifying as the session draws to an end, and that's the reason for this email. 
 
Recently,  I met with members of the Gulf Hammock Hunters Assoc.  This grassroots organization of about 650 people was created about two years ago to "ensure that the wildlife management area relationship between the state, landowner and public is successful."  Last year, through their efforts, 49 tons of garbage was removed from woods and roadways in that area.
 
Their concern is if the state's proposed budget eliminates all funding to pay for leased wildlife management areas in Florida, including Gulf Hammock (Florida's oldest-- established in the late 1940's) that the area will become a "private hunt club" and eliminate the Gulf Hammock as a "public" hunting area. 
 
Without a steady stream of lease dollars from the state, the lessor, Plum Creek Timber Co., will look for other opportunities to insure these assets are income producing.  This poses the real threat that this unspoiled land as a conservation investment for  Florida's future generations will be lost.
 
This entire region is known as the "Nature Coast," and only through preservation efforts such as the "State-Paid Landowner Lease Program," will it remain so.
 
In closing, when Appropriations Chair, Bruce Kyle, can request $706, 693 for a golf course building for his hometown college, certainly, funding for leases to help preserve Florida's unspoiled lands, $404,377, should remain.
 
Please give serious thought to keeping the Gulf Hammock Wildlife Management Area open to the public.
 
Thanks,
 
Sam Lyons

Dear Governor Bush,
 
Last April, 2002 I spoke with you briefly at Edison Community College about re entering the military and how to get help in obtaining a waiver. You instructed me to contact your office and they referred me to Colonel Glenn Sutphin. I've been waiting since then for a waiver, so in the mean time I decided to try another route for a better career and I have applied for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Training Academy in Havana, Fl.
I believe you told me at the time that if my objective was associated with the State Of Florida that you might be able to help me.
I'm more than qualified for the position and my past record is as respectable  as it could possibly be. 
My only regret is that I was not able to complete my courses at Edison because I have a family that I love and had to drop my classes to go back to work. 
My wife and my four sons are the reason I keep trying so hard to do better and I just need a little help from someone higher up to get my foot in the door.
If there is any way you might be able to help me I would greatly appreciate it.
I've just sent a completed packet for the Academy to a Lt. Charlie Bishop and his phone number is 850-539-9656 ext. 105.
I hope that my past military and civilian experience will reflect my abilities and make it possible for me to attend the Academy but I always seem to hit a snag somewhere.

  Dear Governor Bush,                                                   
                    My name is Kimberly Fulenwider and you were kind enough to speak with me today in Pensacola concerning the Medically Needy Program.  Thanks so much for listening to my concerns and encouraging me to write to you. 
                     I am 48 years old and have been enrolled in the program for about 10 years.  I was forced to file for disability after a long ago wreck crushed both Tempromandibular joints and various other bones in my face. I have endured 11 major surgeries in 7 different states, countless procedures, feeding tubes, and endless physical therapy only to end up with constant, chronic pain. I am grateful for how far I've come and the ability to eat real food again, but I am truly a prisoner of pain. Both of my condyles are 3-inch stainless steel bars...my fossas are metal...I have steel plates riveted to both sides of my skull and my face has, I believe, 33 screws in it. Everytime I move my mouth whether to talk, swallow, cough, etc....it causes me pain. I have a CONSTANT headache and severe pressure behind my eyes. I am very sensitive to weather (pressure) changes and often have such sharp pains in my ears that they take my breath away. I am chronically fatigued as I find it difficult to sleep longer than 2 hours at a time. It has truly been a horror show. 
                    My 21-year marriage did not survive partly because my ex-husband's company was constantly on his back because of the money I was costing their insurance. Finally they refused to cover me at all.  We used our children's college savings and finally ended up selling our home to pay for medical expenses.  Because I was unable to work, we also lost our second income. And yet, I didn't file for disability until the marriage actually ended...
as I kept hope that with each surgery, it would be the LAST one, and I could return to work.
                     My function is much better now, but I live in constant pain. My 2 doctors of 12+ years have been wonderful to me and have tried to give me SOME quality of life through the use of monitored narcotic medication as well as anti-rejection and anti-inflammatory drugs. As bad as I hate to admit it, I am dependent on these meds to live. Without them, I simply could not tolerate the pain. 
                      Just this past summer, the Medically Needy program told me I could earn about $400 per month (gross) without losing my benefits. I went right out and found a part-time job working just 2 days a week as my budget is so tight and I was delighted to be able to help myself.  I can't, however, use my skills as a dental hygienist or as a surgical assistant because I would earn TOO much, and you have to stay "POOR" to receive ANY help.  So, I'm working in the floral dept. at Walmart and it's "killing" me. I had no idea I would be required to unload pallets with 20-25 boxes filled with heavy water-and flower filled buckets...break down the buckets with box cutters, mop floors, carry ladders, scrub coolers, etc....but there's not many places where you can go in and say I'd like a job and by the way I can only make...which doesn't translate into many hours, etc. ...certainly not in the medical field.  It is so hard on me physically that it takes me two days to recover from the two days I work.....but I need the income.
                     Now I find out that I'm going to be responsible for my own "share of cost" which is $1,148.00.  My income, with my little Walmart salar, is around $1,500.  As you can see, there is no way I can live on $400 per month.  My total drug cost for each month is around $2,500.  Without the help of my medication, I will have to quit my job as I won't be able to do anything but lay in the bed and cry. If I lose my job I will have to leave my home where I've rented for 10 years. I am desperate for a solution....and fear that I will have to take my own life to bring an end to the pain once and for all.  
                       Governor Bush, my story is just ONE of thousands .....real people with real problems who would not be in this program to begin with if there was not a legitimate need.  As you know, you are screened and double screened to determine real need in the first place.  PLEASE do what you can to find enough money in the budget to continue this much needed program.  Those of us who don't have our health are so very tired of our constant struggle just to stay afloat.  Without the medications our physicians have determined that we need, we have no quality of life...no hope left at all.
                          I am thanking you in advance for your time, interest and compassion. I am,
                                                          Sincerely Yours,
                                                           Kimberly A. Fulenwider

Mr. Governor,

I asked you a question at the Florida Literacy Conference in Orlando and you said I could e-mail you with some information to support my suggestion. I do not know how you can find time to read your e-mail, so I will try to put my ideas in outline.

My suggestions to you at the Florida Literacy Conference on 4/11 were:

1.  Would you consider establishing a committee made up of member of the FLC, adult literacy, and adult vocational educators to make recommendations to you concerning target goals for FCAT reading level scores?

 

2. As and adult education teacher, I suggested to you that a high  school       senior who could test to a 7.5 Reading, 7.5 Math, and 7.5 Language grade level  was functionally educated to the degree that they could be considered a high school graduate.

The following quotation by Dr. Tony Kern, Lt Col, USAF (Ret)

 Former Director of Military History, USAF Academy

is evaluated by my computer as 7.9-grade level by the Flesch-Kincaid readability function on my spell checker. 

Dear friends and fellow Americans

Like everyone else in this great country, I am reeling from last week's attack on our sovereignty. But unlike some, I am not reeling from surprise. As a career soldier and a student and teacher of military history, I have a different perspective and I think you should hear it. This war will be won or lost by the American citizens, not diplomats, politicians or soldiers. Let me briefly explain.  In spite of what the media, and even our own government, is telling us, this act was not committed by a group of deranged fanatics. To dismiss them as such would be among the gravest of mistakes. This attack was committed by an intelligent and dedicated adversary. Don't take this the wrong way. I don't admire these men and I deplore their tactics, but I respect their capabilities. The many parallels that have been made with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor are apropos.

A 7.5 Reader should be able to read and comprehend 95 to 100% of this quotation.

 When I worked with in GED prep classes, I promised anyone who came to me with the 7.5 scores listed above that their ability to process information had been developed to the point to where they were limited only by their desire and determination. I would suggest to you that should be the goal of our public education system.

 When I wrote my book, (fictional history about a teacher and a student, and yes, I'd love to send you a copy), I found out that most fiction is written between a 4.5 and 6.5 grade level. This discovery was what led me to research reading levels further. 

 I would welcome any opportunity to act as a direct resource for you in any way you might consider.

April 7, 2003


Governor Jeb Bush
The Capitol
Tallahassee, Florida 32399-0001

Dear Governor Bush:

It has come to our attention that the budget recommendations from the state
Medicaid office expands the pilot Behavioral/Mental Health managed care
programs from the current locations in Hillsborough and Escambia Counties
throughout the state as a cost saving measure.  This provision is also
included in the Current House Budget and in HB 433.

Funds that are currently going to child welfare residential care programs
would go to a managed care entity and would have a devastating impact on
many residential homes all over the state of Florida.

The Florida Sheriffs Youth Ranches enrolled in the Medicaid program in the
early 1990's and relies heavily upon the Behavioral Health Overlay Services
(BHOS) payments to pay for the mental health services that our children so
desperately need.  If HB 433 becomes law, the Youth Ranches will lose
$800,000 annually and will be unable to provide for the mental health needs
of our most vulnerable and damaged children.

As a statewide organization, we have been serving children for over 45
years. The vast majority of our funding is received from private sources
because of the hard work of Sheriffs throughout the state.  Removal of these
funds will cause us to discharge most of the children currently in residence
under the care and custody of the state.  It would also cause us to turn
down requests for service from any child who is seriously emotionally
disturbed or needing more intense mental health services.

I am urging you to reconsider this decision and study the issue in terms of
its impact on children.  I stand ready to help work with you to find other
cost saving measures but would strongly urge you to exclude children in
residential group care from any behavioral health managed care program.

Thank you for your continued support of Florida's child welfare programs.

Sincerely,


Roger Bouchard, President

Dear Governor 

I have been involved in the prison ministry for almost 5 years now and in that time I have participated in several Kairos programs here at Tomoka CI in Daytona Beach. One of these programs is the Godparents program. 

 

I know that you are VERY busy with many VERY important projects and decisions that will affect the lives of millions of Florida residents, but I am concerned with an issue that could also affect thousands if not hundreds of thousands of Florida residents. 

 

I would like to invite you to come to Tomoka CI in Daytona some Monday night especially within the next couple weeks to see for yourself what the godparent program is doing. 

 

It is VERY important for you to come within the next couple weeks because you will get a true view of what the impact this godparent program has on inmates as the inmates that are  now in this godparents program are nearing the end of their time in the program. (April 21st is the last meeting for this group) 

 

The reason that I’m writing you is that the D.O.C. has stopped godparents from writing or visiting inmates. I understand the reasoning behind the D.O.C. stopping the godparents from writing letters to inmates, BUT godparents are NOT staff. We are volunteers. We are not paid to go to the prison and “feed” these men spiritual food. We do this because we want to show “love to the brethren.” 

 

I (and every other godparent I know) feel that godparents SHOULD be allowed to write (if not also visit) inmates because when the godparent program ends for them, many are still "boys" (if not still “infants) in the Lord and they need further follow up to get them to the place where they are strong enough to "stand" spiritually on their own. During these godparent meetings we cannot just preach to them. We have to gain their confidence first and that takes time ESPECIALLY in the prison environment. 

 

Because of a few misguided and/or selfish individuals that have abused our privileges, the D.O.C. has set “rules” that make everybody else suffer. Why do they make rules that punish “the innocent?” Why don’t they settle for punishing the offender? 

 

Back a couple years ago (group 2) there was one young man that had served 9 years of a 16-year sentence before coming into the godparent program. His family lives in Massachusetts and literally disowned him for being in prison. They wouldn't write to him and didn't visit. He went 9 years without a letter or a visit. Monday nights was his hope and he looked forward every week to his godparent coming to see him and he would get a letter from her a couple times a month. On the last night of his participation in the godparent program, he cried because he wouldn't have any more visits to look forward to until he was released in 7 more years. 

 

In that 7 years the hate and bitterness that IS prison life is most probably going to overshadow the 6 months of love and caring that he and other inmates like him were shown by their godparents. 

 

Almost all of these men are going to be released back into society someday. Do we want them entering society coming out of an environment of hate? Or one of love, concern, and caring?

 

They CAN come out of prison with the feeling of love, concern, and caring.

 

PLEASE say you’ll come.

 

I think that the Lord allowed your daughter to get caught so that you would be able to relate. She came VERY close to being sent to prison. Were just one more element added to her situation she could have been sent to prison for life.

 

PLEASE!

 

God bless you Governor

Subject: Insurance Department's attack on 1500 small businesses


Good Morning Governor...As you may have remembered, in early 2000 you appointed me to the Construction Industry Licensing Board.  In July of 2002, I was elected Chairman of that Board, and I am currently serving in that position.  I have never requested anything from the State before, for either myself or my company, but rather only for non-profit organizations that serve the people of Florida.  Today, I and 1500 other businesses need your help.  We need some assistance to overcome the outrageous attempt by the Insurance Department to Steamroll over 1500 FL small businesses.  The following outlines the specifics that I have discussed in great detail with Senator Lee's office, and to a lesser degree with the Department of Insurance.  Senator Lee is pursuing this matter as well with the Insurance Department, but asked that I send you a copy of my concerns:
 
1.	Lang Engineering used a self insured fund (FESA) in the early 90's to provide workers compensation, as there was no other option in Florida at that time.  I'm sure that you remember the crises that there was in the workers compensation industry back then.  The Insurance Department says that ..."we understand that ...FESA members now regret their decision to join an assessable self-insurance fund." How sanctimonious... We had no options at that time...yet does not the Insurance Department have some responsibility to monitor Insurance carries and funds??? Once we had another option in 1994, we went with a real carrier. 
 
2.	FESA was found to be insolvent in 1996, and the Insurance Department admitted that the owner/manager of the fund was a crook, but in spite of that, they let him go free to roam the streets of Palm Beach, and they went after approximately 1500 small businesses, and set outrageous monetary charges against each of us in 1999. 
 
3.	Many of the companies that were insured by FESA did seek legal assistance to attempt to stop the Insurance Department from their bullying tactics against us.  In fact, because of this effort with our attorney, the court ruled in June 2000 that we could pay a reduced assessment, and the State Insurance Department admitted that "Any member who timely paid their assessment would also be released from additional liabilities for any remaining deficit."   We immediately paid our full assessment of $76,213 at that time. 
 
4.	The State now tells us that there were two additional hearings by the court following this where the State Insurance Department pushed the courts to change their position, whereby small businesses would be penalized if they continued their litigation to have this entire matter dismissed, even though we had paid our full assessment.  They never sent us a copy of that hearing result. 
 
5.	Earlier this year, the Insurance Department sought to have The Court approve Final Judgments against approximately 1500 small businesses for $$ amounts averaging almost $10 Million each (Our assessment was $13,640,000)...In other words, full liability against each business.  When they were called on it by our attorney, they said..."We didn't intend to seek Final Judgments against each business, we were only asking the court for their thoughts..." That is an outright lie, as their filing clearly states. The Insurance Department quickly backtracked.    
 
6.	Now the Insurance Department is again seeking to intimidate the small businesses by seeking to have each company agree in advance to "work with them on some additional (as yet unknown) settlement monies" or if we don't agree, they again use extortion tactics and state that the "Receiver will not extend this settlement to any policyholder who, before all settlements have been finally approved by the courts, asks the court to decide whether a final judgment may be rendered."  This precludes us from any further litigation to have this matter dropped...This also again makes us potentially liable for a multi-million assessment.   This smacks of extortion.  Is this how the State should treat its businesses? 
  
7.	Although we have expended thousands of dollars on litigation and also the total payment of $76,213 to the State to settle this matter in full in 2000, the Insurance Department and their attorneys have spent millions of dollars and used the full power of the State in an attempt to bury many small businesses, whenever and however they wish.  This isn't right, it isn't fair and it certainly isn't helping the consumers (including business) of the State who they are supposed to protect. 
 
8.	In conclusion, I would like to suggest a reasonable settlement proposal.  If the Governor's Office can convince the Insurance Department to allow those that paid in full in June 2000 not be responsible for any future assessments, I would not seek to get my $76,213 reimbursed.  That is a fair resolution of this matter, and in fact, that is what was agreed to in June 2000.  We paid all monies in full at that time, and the State sure cashed that check for $76,213 quickly. 
 
Thank you for your assistance in the above matter.  If we cannot get this matter reasonably resolved, it may lead to the bankruptcy of our firm, and many of the other 1500 firms involved.
 
Sincerely, 
 
Robert A. Lang, President Lang Environmental
      & Chairman, FL Construction Industry Licensing Board

Just wanted to say thank you for your leadership in closing the deal with 
Bill Foley and his team. We just spent the last several days in Santa Barbara 
with Bill and many others completing the details and meeting with two hundred 
managers and spouses being asked to move to Jax. 

It went very well and tomorrow morning we'll present the project to the JEDC 
with the FNF decision to bring 750 jobs with a minimum average wage over 
$62,000 and a capital investment of $53 million to start. They will locate 
downtown--in an enterprise zone/brownfield--and bring another Fortune 500 
headquarters to Florida and Jacksonville. (You can probably tell I'm excited).

But what we don't always get to say is how much your influence plays in these 
kind of projects. Your calls and visits carry more weight than you know--and 
long after the contact. We do appreciate your focus on ED and willingness to 
take the time to make it happen.

By the way your team at EFI and OTTED are real professionals and are great at 
following though and working closely with us in the process.

Thanks again,

Jerry

Subject:	Film Commission office is important

 
 
Dear Senators,
 

The film office in Tallahassee is very important to all of us. It is the film office that talks to production companies, helps with locations, permitting, and much more.  Money from filming comes back 7 fold. Services are needed from the community such as food, dry cleaners, car & truck rentals, office supplies, building supplies, home and apartment rentals, production offices, telephone services, security, clothing as well as film equipment, and we employ many people who spend money and pay taxes. All this brings in tax money, much needed money for the state, not to mention the tourists who like to visit the area where their favorite movie or TV series are filmed.

 

Our friends in the State Film Office have done a wonderful job of bringing in film projects to our state. They work many hours with producers, directors to show them the benefits of our state for their filming projects. Remember, we are striving for work that can be done in Canada with help from the government, in some cases as much as 35% of their budget in incentives. Other states that have seen the benefit of films in there state now have similar incentives. We need to keep up or pass them. 

 

When a film comes to a town, locations are selected, cleaned up in some cases and left in better shape then they were found. We are a clean business, no pollution, and great money spent while they are here.

 

So when you are voting on budget issues remember we bring in money to the state not just spend it.

Honorable Bush:

I understand that our Government wants to redesign the
state automobile license plate. When our state
government is in such a budget cut, is this really
something that we need to spend money on. I have the
understanding that it will cost over a million dollars
to have this done. Wouldn't this money be spent more
wisely on something else, like education or even
better yet, how about protecting the citrus industry.
You know agriculture is a $16 BILLION a year industry
in our state- only second to tourism, but not since
Sept. 11, 2001- agriculture has carried our economy.
Of this $16 BILLION over $9 Billion of it is from
citrus, plus the inpact it has in the communities
across our state.

You may not realize it but Florida grows the best
citrus product in the world- nobody can grow it like
we do. Our state should be proud of this great
accomplishment and the job our growers do. 

I ask that you take a strong look at this. Is this
really what you want to do? We need to let everybody
know about this product that we grow so well and that
we support the citrus industry.

Thank You

Dear Governor Bush,

I'm a 16 year old teenager from Jacksonville, Florida and I had the wonderful opportunity of spending a week in Tallahassee this past week with a program called TeenPact.  It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that helped me learn a great deal about how the government works.  One of the exercises we did was to plan a tour with someone in a high office.  I had the awesome opportunity of touring your office, but was disappointed to find that we had just missed you due to a trip to Texas.  I was able to find out your personal email address and I had a few questions that I wanted to ask you.

I was interested in first knowing what your prayer requests are.  I love God with all my heart and I would love praying for you.  Another thing, I was wondering how you are able to influence people around you with God's word?  My last question is what's the toughest obstacle you've ever faced while in office?

I hope that God blesses you for the rest of the time you are in office.  Knowing that I have a Christian leader directing our state gives me a great peace-of-mind and you are doing such a wonderful job!  Thanks!

Sincerely,

John B.

Jeb,

I am sure you are aware that Rep. Harrington and Sen. Dockery have bills that transfer funds from marina fuel tax revenues in DOT to the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission for boating and waterways activities.  These funds are transferred over a 5 year period with $2.5 million transferred next fiscal year to fund waterway signs and markers, public boat ramps, piers and docks, and law enforcement.  The boating industry has been actively pursuing this needed revenue for several years and these bills now have the support of the boating, angling, and environmental community because of a commitment to remove language damaging to the FWC manatee research and management activities.  Although we are not in the practice of supporting "raids" on funds appropriated to other agencies, the rather small amount of funds involved, the fact that waterways are a stated purpose of the marina fuel tax dollars, and the substantial benefit to the boaters of Florida and the economy, has led to our full support.  The focus of these funds will also compliment our desire to regain control of the manatee situation in the State.  By all measures, our ability to police and manage our waterways is terribly inadequate and it gets worse every day.  I understand that you may have problems with these bills and the reallocation of revenues.  If this is so, can we discuss your concerns and have a chance to address them?  


Thanks , Rodney

Subject:	The Gantt Report - FAMU Trustees


The Gantt Report




By Lucius Gantt

     Don't take my word for it but it appears the Florida A&M University Board of Trustees are embarrassing Governor Jeb Bush.
     Newspaper reports indicate recent Chairmen of the FAMU Trustees are trying to micromanage the University.
     Trustees are trying to decide who works for FAMU and who gets a contract to do business at FAMU.
     Florida's best and brightest African-Americans need not apply for a position on the highest of seven hills. Trustees, and some administrators, only want Rattlers that they can control.
     Anything and anybody that the Trustees can't control, they try to destroy. Anybody who will stand up and speak out, they try to silence.
     The only university trustees in apparent disarray are the ones at Florida A&M. There has been a slew of trustee resignations. There have been accusations about purchasing improprieties regarding the acquisition of student housing.
     FAMU Trustees are dropping like flies. Trustees are dropping like rats on a sinking ship.
     Why? Because most trustees want to help FAMU but are being stifled by people who want to be King makers and new age education extortionists.
     Jeb Bush doesn't need zoo lions to take his message to the jungle! Jeb Bush needs Black appointees who will tell the truth. FAMU needs trustees who will do what is best for FAMU and not what is best for trustee egos!
     When all of the current trustees are gone, FAMU will still survive.
     The people who love FAMU will continue to show Rattler pride regardless of who is appointed as university overseer!
     The first FAMU Trustee Chairman thought he was the Rattler Godfather. How do you like him now? You can't even find him. 
     You are big when you have the "title" but if you were an Uncle Tom before being appointed a trustee, you will be an Uncle Tom after your term is up.
     FAMU has bigger problems than showboating bigwigs. FAMU should increase the percentage of African-Americans in FAMU purchasing transactions and get the FCAT tests straight at FAMU High. FAMU should hire qualified professors to replace Roosevelt Wilson and faculty members who retired via the "drop program" and work hard to help Athletic Director J.R.E. Lee move FAMU athletics to Division One status.
     Even if you are a university trustee, you can't pimp the people! (Contact Lucius Gantt at lbgantt@aol.com. Gantt's book "I Talked About The Beast" is now available)

Subject: Call to Action: The Education Budget Crisis


Hello!
 
I am writing because I am alarmed about the budget crunch we are facing in the near future.
 
As an ESOL Resource Teacher at Area 3 in Palm Beach County Schools and a parent, I understand the importance of the programs likely to be cut if the budget crisis is not resolved.
 
Teacher Aides make significant contributions to the ESOL program, KG - second grade, and ESE.  All these kids need lots of hands-on work as well as small group work and some one-on-one.  Teacher aides are the most affordable and professional way to carry out the mission of these special programs.  We cannot do without their help if you expect students to pass FCAT by third grade.
 
Other programs likely to be cut in this budget crunch are magnet, the seven-period day, high school sports and full-time KG.  If you cut full-time KG, how do you expect these children to become literate enough to pass the ever-increasing demands of FCAT by third grade?  As academic demands become more rigorous, the seven-period day and magnet programs become more essential for student progress.  Sports programs are also a key to academic development.  They build teamwork skills, leadership abilities, develop physical well-being (excellent for brain development and funciton), and encourage certain students to just plain stay in school and get good grades.
 
Please work very hard to ensure that an appropriate education budget is passed so we can have the money to hired certified teachers, order supplies and have students properly scheduled by the time school starts on August 13.  Our future depends on it.
 
Sincerely,
 
Carol S. Bowling

I have heard from Steve and many others multiple times over the last 2

I have also heard that the amendment filed by Senator Garcia for an open
heart exemption was for a Tenet facility -Palmetto Hospital in Hialelah
(mentioned below). The amendment was not adopted as of Friday am.

Aside fron the FHA co-authored study about Coronary Bypass Surgery & CON
that Steve mentions below (he one I sent you a summary on) -No one has
spoken about the needs of the public being the priority. A few now speak
reluctantly  about working with us on reforming the "process". 

The Martin Memorial Hospital CON was approved by AHCA and then denied by an
Administrative Law Judge (DOAH) after our decision was challenged by several
competing hospitals.

Will continue to watch..... And will follow up

Subject: Opposition to Open Heart CON special exemptions


Dear Governor,

	Pursuant to Alan Levine's suggestion, I am contacting you regarding
my opposition to special exemptions for open heart CONs for 5 hospitals in
bills  HB 865(by Rep. Harrell) and SB 460(Sen. Pruitt). The substance of
these bills were unfortunately placed on a nursing home bill(SB 1252) on
Friday  with  some needed reforms suggested by Sen. Saunders that the
Florida Hospital Association and my client Tenet have supported. 
	Because I greatly respect you and  appreciate our friendship, I have
been very reluctant to lobby you on client issues. I rarely do so but  I
believe this is a bad legislative precedent. As you might recall, as result
of a question about this legislation from Kathleen,  I briefly discussed
this issue with you and Kathleen when we were in New York.  
	Having represented Tenet and other hospitals for the past 23 years,
I am well aware of some of the problems with the CON process. However
allowing a few select large hospitals an exemption from the process is not
the way to address the problem. My client and HCA have tried to work with
Martin Memorial and Indian River Hospitals to address this issue, but since
the same lobbying team represents them and Boca and Bethesda we have been
unsuccessful in reaching a settlement and separating those who deserve the
CON from those that don't. We have also have spent considerable time with
Alan and Rhonda Meadows trying to suggest cures short of these special
exemptions being placed in   legislation.   Interestingly, since Tenet has
withdrawn from Martin's CON hearing and HCA has made the same offer, the
only thing now stopping Martin from getting an open heart CON is the
opposition of Martin's allies in this exemption legislation, Boca and
Bethesda. 
	 
	If you allow these hospitals to get these CONs in this manner, there
really will be nothing stopping other hospitals from doing the same in the
future no matter the merits of the applications or action by your agency.
AHCA has not even approved at agency level Bethesda's application and Boca
was denied by the hearing officer because they could not meet the agency's
requirements after careful review.
	 
	Many respected doctors who practice in the field, like the Dr.
Vijayanagar, Chair of the State Board of Medicine and Dr. Zachariah oppose
eliminating the open heart CON process for quality of health reasons.
Respected studies published in the AMA journal support claims that without
open heart CONs there is at least a 20 percent increase in mortality in
patients because of the lack of experience and quality control issues.     
	 
	I am sure this looks like a fight between special interests and some
ways it is. However , my client during the past 3 years that we have fought
this legislation has had the opportunity to be included in bills and
amendments which would have provided for them to get open heart CONs in
hospitals like St. Mary's in West Palm Beach and Palmetto in Hialeah( no
hospital in NW Dade has an open heart, and area much larger than South Palm
Beach County). Tenet and HCA have declined because they believe if we are to
reform the process it should be done on a statewide basis and not just for
the wealthiest districts. There also many other parts of the very regulated
health care profession that need reform also beside the CON process. 
	 
	We are working very hard with the FHA( who also strongly opposes
these open heart exemptions) to support meaningful medical malpractice
reform and we greatly appreciate what you are doing in that regard. 
	 
	I am sorry to bother you with this issue but I am sure you will be
asked again for your opinion now that these special exemptions have been
placed very quickly with little notice and no debate in the Senate on the
nursing home legislation. I also saw your recent comments in the St. Pete
Times objecting to special carve outs in the CON process. Nothing can be
more special than this legislation.
	 
	No matter what you decide, I will understand and respect your
decision. 
	 
	Steve.

Palm Beach County Budget Crisis
 
A Budget Crisis is looming for the Palm Beach County schools, and we need your help immediately.  Call or email our Florida Lesilators today and ask them to find additional dollars for our public schools!
 
Under the Florida Constitution, education funding is the responsibility  of state government.  Currently, the legislature in Tallahassee, is considering three proposed budgets for education in Florida.  None of these proposed budgets provides enough funding to operate our school system for the FY-04 school year.
 
The budget deficits are large:$52.3 million deficit-Senate Budget; $66.3 milllion deficit-Governor's Budget; $81.7 million deficit-House Budget.  Only the State Senate has said they are willing to consider providing more money for education.
 
If the legislature does not provide adequate funding, some very important education programs in Palm Beach County may be cut.  The cuts may include:
 
Magnet Schools, 7-Period day, Full-time Kindergarten, Teacher Aides, High School Sports
 
Attached are the names of the elected officials in Tallahassee who we need to contact immediately.  Our Palm Beach Delegation needs your support and needs to hear from you.

Subject: Insurance Department's attack on 1500 small businesses


Good Morning Governor...As you may have remembered, in early 2000 you appointed me to the Construction Industry Licensing Board.  In July of 2002, I was elected Chairman of that Board, and I am currently serving in that position.  I have never requested anything from the State before, for either myself or my company, but rather only for non-profit organizations that serve the people of Florida.  Today, I and 1500 other businesses need your help.  We need some assistance to overcome the outrageous attempt by the Insurance Department to Steamroll over 1500 FL small businesses.  The following outlines the specifics that I have discussed in great detail with Senator Lee's office, and to a lesser degree with the Department of Insurance.  Senator Lee is pursuing this matter as well with the Insurance Department, but asked that I send you a copy of my concerns:
 
1.	Lang Engineering used a self insured fund (FESA) in the early 90's to provide workers compensation, as there was no other option in Florida at that time.  I'm sure that you remember the crises that there was in the workers compensation industry back then.  The Insurance Department says that ..."we understand that ...FESA members now regret their decision to join an assessable self-insurance fund." How sanctimonious... We had no options at that time...yet does not the Insurance Department have some responsibility to monitor Insurance carries and funds??? Once we had another option in 1994, we went with a real carrier. 
 
2.	FESA was found to be insolvent in 1996, and the Insurance Department admitted that the owner/manager of the fund was a crook, but in spite of that, they let him go free to roam the streets of Palm Beach, and they went after approximately 1500 small businesses, and set outrageous monetary charges against each of us in 1999. 
 
3.	Many of the companies that were insured by FESA did seek legal assistance to attempt to stop the Insurance Department from their bullying tactics against us.  In fact, because of this effort with our attorney, the court ruled in June 2000 that we could pay a reduced assessment, and the State Insurance Department admitted that "Any member who timely paid their assessment would also be released from additional liabilities for any remaining deficit."   We immediately paid our full assessment of $76,213 at that time. 
 
4.	The State now tells us that there were two additional hearings by the court following this where the State Insurance Department pushed the courts to change their position, whereby small businesses would be penalized if they continued their litigation to have this entire matter dismissed, even though we had paid our full assessment.  They never sent us a copy of that hearing result. 
 
5.	Earlier this year, the Insurance Department sought to have The Court approve Final Judgments against approximately 1500 small businesses for $$ amounts averaging almost $10 Million each (Our assessment was $13,640,000)...In other words, full liability against each business.  When they were called on it by our attorney, they said..."We didn't intend to seek Final Judgments against each business, we were only asking the court for their thoughts..." That is an outright lie, as their filing clearly states. The Insurance Department quickly backtracked.    
 
6.	Now the Insurance Department is again seeking to intimidate the small businesses by seeking to have each company agree in advance to "work with them on some additional (as yet unknown) settlement monies" or if we don't agree, they again use extortion tactics and state that the "Receiver will not extend this settlement to any policyholder who, before all settlements have been finally approved by the courts, asks the court to decide whether a final judgment may be rendered."  This precludes us from any further litigation to have this matter dropped...This also again makes us potentially liable for a multi-million assessment.   This smacks of extortion.  Is this how the State should treat its businesses? 
  
7.	Although we have expended thousands of dollars on litigation and also the total payment of $76,213 to the State to settle this matter in full in 2000, the Insurance Department and their attorneys have spent millions of dollars and used the full power of the State in an attempt to bury many small businesses, whenever and however they wish.  This isn't right, it isn't fair and it certainly isn't helping the consumers (including business) of the State who they are supposed to protect. 
 
8.	In conclusion, I would like to suggest a reasonable settlement proposal.  If the Governor's Office can convince the Insurance Department to allow those that paid in full in June 2000 not be responsible for any future assessments, I would not seek to get my $76,213 reimbursed.  That is a fair resolution of this matter, and in fact, that is what was agreed to in June 2000.  We paid all monies in full at that time, and the State sure cashed that check for $76,213 quickly. 
 
Thank you for your assistance in the above matter.  If we cannot get this matter reasonably resolved, it may lead to the bankruptcy of our firm, and many of the other 1500 firms involved.
 
Sincerely, 
 
Robert A. Lang, President Lang Environmental
      & Chairman, FL Construction Industry Licensing Board

Dear Florida Elected Officials: 



It is very difficult to to receive documents from the management company of Chimney Lakes Owners Association in Southwest Jacksonville. They sent me a letter back. They list statutes that do not apply to home owners associations and some (FL Statute 617.303) that do not exist. The financial report did not include all the months for 2002 or the information they say is listed in the letter. I will file a small claims law suit again for violating FL Statute 720 as I have done before  <http://www.ccfj.net/chimdocscc.html> http://www.ccfj.net/chimdocscc.html . The citizens of Florida need your help.

The Case Against State Protection of Homeowner Associations by George K. Staropoli 


April 19, 2003

By Marcus Aurelius 

 <http://www.ahrc.com/new/index.php/src/news/sub/pressrel/action/ShowMedia/id/486> http://www.ahrc.com/new/index.php/src/news/sub/pressrel/action/ShowMedia/id/486


Scottsdale, Arizona - Over the past forty years there has been an ever-increasing dispersion of a new social order in America. Its roots are founded in the spread of planned communities and its model of community governance that is an undemocratic, police state insistence on conformity to rules set through the façade of democratic institutions, much like those we are familiar with in regard to those "Peoples Republics" throughout the world. 

Each day, more and more children are living under and learning about this form a private government that does not respect the beliefs, rights and freedoms underlying the US Constitution or US Bill of Rights. 

The proliferation of planned communities and their homeowner associations / Planned Owners Associations / Common Interest Developments form of governance arose from the ashes of and over the failures of utopian views of ideal societies. 

This form of governance is based on socialism with the ownership of common properties and the need for the governmental control and regulation of the members of the community. As with all planned communities, from the utopian communities of the early 1920s to the existing Cuban, Chinese and Korean governments, an enforcement agency is necessary because the foundations of the society and community rest of principles and values found, over history, to be contrary to our human nature. 

According to Forrest McDonald in Novus Ordo Seclorum, the Founding Fathers did not try to reform human nature, but set up mechanisms of checks and balances and a separation of powers that recognized human behavior for what it has been for centuries. Utopian ideals were not made part of the "new order of ages" created by the Founding Fathers, but ideals based on the most prominent political and economic theorists and principles were used to create the greatest nation on earth. 

These associations quickly found that it was necessary to micromanagement of a person's life is required in order to attain conformity with the objectives of the association. And the objectives of these "states", these private organizations based on court rulings that Covenants Codes & Restrictions (CCRs) are valid contracts, are the maintenance of property values through the strict enforcement of the CC&Rs by a governing body so created, without a homeowners bill of rights, without any reference or inclusion of the U.S. or state Constitutions, and with the total abdication of involvement and oversight by our civil government. In essence, they have become a state within a state and protected by the greater civil government to function, operate and violate the laws, values and fundamental beliefs of our country. 

The reader is probably saying to himself, "No, this is not true, just the babblings of a malcontent with a personal issue. There is no radical change or a new order within American society. It is not possible here in America. It could never happen here, the bastion of democracy". But, it's true and has happened here in America, the bastion of democracy. 

How this has come about is well documented in several books. In the early 1990s, two notable books were published by political scientists: Privatopia: Homeowner Associations and the Rise of Residential Private Government, Evan McKenzie and Neighborhood Politics: Residential Community Associations in American Governance, Robert J. Dilger. 

A more recent book, 2000, is Community Associations: The Emergence and Acceptance of a Quiet Innovation in Housing, Donald Stabile, funded by the homeowner association trade group, Community Associations Institute ( CAI), and one of its founding supporters, The Urban Land Institute, a non-profit, real estate land usage organization founded as the Real Estate Foundation, as separate from the FHA. 

As Stabile well documents, the FHA worked assiduously to promote and encourage the use of planned communities as a means to affordable housing under the most efficient use of the land argument of ULI. Yet, there has been no involvement by political scientists or sociologists in this national effort to restructure our society around profit making for real estate interests, with a "good word" by our federal government to promote this new social order. 

In his new book, The Case Against State Protection of Homeowner Associations, the author, George K. Staropoli, reveals his naïve attempt over 3 years in Arizona to call attention to the acceptance, encouragement and defense of these private government organizations by state legislatures, state agencies such as the real estate departments, the builder and real estate agent trade groups and sadly, the media that still refuses to present both sides equally. 

His book documents the harsh reality that our state governments have abdicated the values, beliefs, principles and laws that made America stand out alone as the model of good government; that special interest groups have promoted their views of this social order while hiding the other side of the coin; and that this order has been accepted by the public in general, defending their acts as "protecting their investment values in their homes" and that they are private organizations that are party to private contracts entered into voluntarily and with full knowledge of the consequences by homeowners. 

Staropoli provides substantial documentation relating to violations of U,S. and state Constitutions and statutes; US Supreme Court and Arizona and other state Supreme Court rulings directly bearing on these violations; of attitudes that reflect "better bricks and mortar" make a better America and that fundamental American values, beliefs and principles play second place to this overriding "state" objective of these planned communities. Self-interest, isolation from the larger community and conformity are the overriding values of this new societal order rapidly overtaking America. 

This is must reading for anyone seeking a new home, for students of government, for political theorists and scientists, for historians, for government officials and for the judiciary. This book reveals how this "quiet innovation in housing" has undermined our American way of life and replaced it with an overriding, yet superficial and unproven concern that planned communities are the only means to enhance property values.

Governor: Thanks so much for meeting with Vicki Tschinkel and me earlier this week. We know how busy you are. And thank you again for your leadership on Florida Forever. 

With regard to the open space plan for the Florida Panhandle, we believe this is a unique and fleeting opportunity to save northwest Florida's environment while at the same time creating the conditions for a strong and sustainable economy. Doing this would be a wonderful legacy for the future of Florida and an example of public/private cooperation of national significance.

If this concept has merit in your view, we thought it might be useful to list some specific steps that your administration might take to further its implementation:

1.	Create a task force to review, revise and oversee implementation of the plan. The task force might include key members of your administration, local government, the military, major business and landowner interests and environmental groups. Perhaps the Wekiva Task Force is a model for what might be done. Obviously much pre-planning is required for this to be successful. 

2.	Continue to work with the Department of Defense on appropriating funds for the purchase of conservation easements to create the defense corridor connecting Eglin to the Apalachicola Basin. Mollie Palmer has been very, very helpful on this, but our guess is that actual appropriations will ultimately require high level involvement. Congressman Miller's office is very supportive of this as are the Eglin military and civilian leadership. 

3.	Continue to place high priority on northwest Florida projects identified on the map for ranking and acquisition by Florida Forever. 

4.	Ask DCA to work with local governments and major landowners to create sector planning processes or other innovative methods for areas where growth, military operations and important conservation resources may conflict. The West Bay Sector Plan is an example of the sort of thing which might be done elsewhere. 

5.	Design state-funded infrastructure investment to reinforce implementation of the plan 

6.	Encourage the St Joe Company to work together with the Division of State Lands, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and The Nature Conservancy to set out a long term plan for acquisition of conservation lands by purchase or through mitigation that might dovetail with other elements of the plan.

Thanks again for your leadership.  Have a good Easter holiday.

Headline:  HHS TO AWARD $80 MILLION TO STATES TO OFFSET COSTS
OF INSURANCE FOR RESIDENTS TOO SICK FOR CONVENTIONAL COVERAGE


HHS Secretary Tommy G. Thompson today announced the availability of $80
million in grants for states that provide health insurance to residents who
cannot get conventional health coverage because they are too sick.

The grants would be used by states to offset losses they may incur operating
high-risk pools, which are typically state-created non-profit association
that offers health coverage to individuals with serious medical conditions.
Enrollment in these pools is growing, with more than 153,000 individuals
enrolled in state pools.

"These grants will make it more affordable for states to expand access to
health care through high risk pools for the uninsured," Secretary Thompson
said.  "Individuals who benefit from these pools usually have a history of
health problems that make it extremely difficult to find affordable health
coverage in the individual market."

The funding announced today will be awarded over two years, as authorized in
the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform Act of 2002.  To be eligible, a state
must have a "qualified" high-risk pool that meets the criteria specified in
the Trade Act and must follow such rules as capping premiums at no higher
than 150 percent of the standard charge in the state.  States may be
eligible for a grant that matches up to 50 percent of the losses incurred in
the operation of the risk pools.  Funds will be distributed based on the
number of uninsured individuals in each state.  HHS' Center for Medicare &
Medicaid Services (CMS) will administer the program.

To date, 22 states have high-risk pools that meet the "qualified" criteria.
In November, HHS also announced the availability of grants of up to $1
million each for states to use as seed money to establish high-risk pools.
A total of $20 million is available under that program.

The grants to support state high-risks pools are one piece in the Bush
Administration's broad strategy for expanding access to health care for the
more than 40 million Americans without health insurance.  The President's
fiscal year 2004 budget plan would expand community health centers that care
for the uninsured, strengthen and modernize the Medicaid program, offer
health tax credits to help individuals obtain insurance, and extend Medicaid
and State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) coverage to more
Americans who otherwise would go without coverage.

"Getting health insurance to the uninsured has been a high priority of the
Bush Administration," said CMS Administrator Tom Scully.  "These new grants
for high-risk pools will help get coverage to people who otherwise would not
have access to health care."

Information about this new program and how states may apply for a grant will
be included in a final rule with comment period to be published May 2 in the
Federal Register.  More information about risk pools is available at
www.cms.hhs.gov/riskpool.  More information about the President's
initiatives to help the uninsured is available at
http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2003pres/20030211.html.

understand the reason that funding is being cut for "Florida Wildlife"

Trade bid targets UPS hub


FTAA leaders also want AirTran HQ in Atlanta

Walter Woods   Staff writer 


Organizers trying to coax the headquarters of the Free Trade Area of the Americas to Atlanta also want AirTran Airways Inc. to move its home office here and United Parcel Service Inc. to relocate its Miami hub to Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport, documents show. 

	


Relocating both the AirTran and UPS business have been in the daydreams of city fathers for years, but the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) effort has given both initiatives a new selling point. 


Both ideas show up on a checklist of things Atlanta must do to win the FTAA headquarters, according to a report passed around various city organizations, including the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce and the Atlanta Convention & Visitors Bureau. 


UPS' home office is in Dunwoody, but its $30 million Latin America gateway is at Miami International Airport. The 250,000-square-foot facility routes 30,000 packages a day and serves as a base for 13 aircraft. 


Because of its Latin American hub, Big Brown is the largest air cargo shipper at Miami's airport.

The UPS (NYSE: UPS) business would be a whopper for Hartsfield, which is well behind Miami as a center for cargo. 


Miami's airport was the sixth-largest cargo airport in the world last year, according to the Airports Council International, the association of the world's airports. Hartsfield ranked No. 22. 


UPS said it had no plans to move its Latin American base, which opened in 2001. 


As for AirTran, its hub is at Hartsfield, and nearly half of its passengers and 75 percent of its flights go through Atlanta's airport. The company also has a reservations office and a training center here, as well as a 91,000-square-foot engine repair warehouse. 


A new $14.5 million Atlanta hangar, complete with a 20,000-square-foot office building, will be completed by December. 


But the discount airline's corporate offices are in Orlando, Fla. AirTran has a total of 5,000 employees at airports in the 40 cities it serves and at headquarters in Orlando. 


The company's previous incarnation, ValuJet, was based here. 


The rumor of AirTran (NYSE: AAI) moving here has been going on "for years," a spokesperson said. "There are no plans to move." 


Still, boosters at the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce and the Atlanta Convention & Visitors Bureau would like to see all those Florida operations in Atlanta, and lobbying efforts are under way to make that happen, according to the local FTAA organizers' report. 


Even better, the defections would be a slap at the Sunshine State, specifically Miami, which is lobbying hard to win the Free Trade Area of the Americas office for itself. Even Atlanta organizers concede Miami has an early advantage. 


The moves also would establish Atlanta as a gateway to the Americas, regardless of where the FTAA home office lands. 


"There are a number of tie-in initiatives we're working on to greatly complement Atlanta's profile," said Bill Howard, vice president of the Atlanta Convention & Visitors Bureau, which is behind Atlanta's FTAA effort along with the Metro Atlanta Chamber, the city of Atlanta and the state of Georgia. 


"The No. 1 goal is the [FTAA headquarters], the No. 2 goal is to increase the profile of Atlanta as a global commerce center. The campaign has value in itself," Howard said. 


The to-do list, which includes the UPS and AirTran notions, was drawn up by Gordon Giffin, a partner at McKenna, Long & Aldridge LLP and the former U.S. Ambassador to Canada, with Bob Coggin, the former vice president of marketing for Delta Air Lines Inc., and Roberto Peon, chief marketing officer for BellSouth Corp. international. 


"There will be a multitude of [positive] ancillary developments" from the effort to bring the free trade zone's headquarters to Atlanta, Giffin said. 


Giffin, Coggin and Peon are three of the lead organizers of Atlanta's effort to win what's called the "secretariat," or headquarters, of the Free Trade Area of the Americas, a proposed free trade pact of 34 democracies in the Western Hemisphere. 


FTAA, if it's approved by the member nations, would pull down trade barriers from Alaska to the tip of South America. The trade federation's $14 trillion gross domestic product and 800 million consumers would dwarf the European Union. 


Giffin said international events have not sapped the FTAA's momentum, and member nations are still pushing for the pact to be signed. 


The Bush administration is also still behind the agreement, which was originally set to be signed by 2005. 


But the timetable is moving and the trade zone could be approved next year. The 34 nations signing the pact could select a headquarters in 2004, Howard said. 


The accelerated timetable has put the clock on Atlanta's bid effort, which is scrambling to assemble a board of local CEOs and hire an executive director, hopefully within the next 30 days, Howard said. 


A press conference about Atlanta's bid, with Gov. Sonny Perdue and Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin, is scheduled for early May. 


The stakes are high. The secretariat would create 11,000 new jobs and have an economic impact of $500 million a year on metro Atlanta, the equivalent of attracting a plant the size of DaimlerChrysler AG's facility in Pooler, Ga., every year or hosting two Super Bowls each year. 


Atlanta's effort is currently lobbying to host a newly proposed meeting of FTAA delegates that may be held in September. Brazil and Canada, two large member nations, are pushing for a fall meeting. If it happens, local organizers want it here, Howard said. 


FTAA ministers are planning to gather in Miami at a previously scheduled meeting in November. Atlanta's bid team will be there to crash Miami's party, and are putting together an advertising campaign in South Florida to coincide with the meeting. 


Franklin led a delegation of business leaders to Quito, Ecuador, to the last ministerial meeting in October. 


Howard and others are also trying to host an event in Washington, D.C., later this year with Georgia's congressional delegation and key ambassadors from FTAA nations. 


Atlanta organizers admit they're fighting an uphill battle versus Miami's effort, which has raised about $2 million and has the backing of the president's brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. 


But Atlanta has its own supporters, including Jimmy Carter and Andrew Young, and it's had no problems raising money, Giffin said. Private corporations have pledged about $1 million for Atlanta's effort, while the state has pledged $250,000. 


Mexico City also is bidding for the secretariat, as is Panama City, but organizers have at least one less bid to worry about, namely Houston. 


After months of rumors, a spokesperson for the Greater Houston Partnership, its Chamber of Commerce, said Houston's fathers have no intention of lobbying for the FTAA secretariat. 


"We don't know where [that rumor] came from," the spokesperson said.

Subject:	De-regulation of Talent Agencies

 
Florida Motion Picture
& Television Association
 
RE: De-regulation of Talent Agencies
 
Dear Senators,
 
Once again the issue of de-regulation of Talent Agencies is at hand. I have been involved with the film industry since 1989 and if you could see first hand some of the problems, you would understand why we are so opposed to the de-regulation of talent agencies. Non licensed agencies could open in a town and do business any way they wish. This means charge high prices for pictures, comp cards, classes and even representation. Now this may not seem to bad but in our business parents think little Mary is so cute she should be in the movies. Dollar signs come to their mind and off they go to be taken advantage of and robbed of thousands of dollars before realizing little Mary is just a normal kid with out talent for our industry. Then there is the young guy, age 19 who wants to be a "star" in movies. He signs up to take classes, get pictures and the rest, only to find out after thousands of dollars he is just a normal teenager looking to belong. Then comes the senior citizen who is on a fixed income, normally not very much, sees an article about companies coming to Florida to find white haired/healthy looking seniors for print jobs (magazines ads, brochures, and even billboards) and the next thing you know they have spent any extra money they had on the hope of making some extra money in the film business and having all there friends envy them. Then in all these cases you have the money or lack of it, agencies keeping the money until they feel like paying, all the time earning interest as well as charging high percentage to represent them. 
 
So what is the answer? Well if given a years grace we might be able to find a way to handle the situation. The Florida Motion Picture & Television Association is a trade association statewide and we would like the chance to help fix the problem. May I suggest a clamp down on collecting license fees, put them in a trust fund, and use that money to keep the (for lack of a better word) crooks out of our business. There are many legitimate agencies in Florida and they want to help the cause too. 
 
So I ask you to vote against de-regulation at this time and help us find a way to deal with the situation.

Subject:	Education

Governor Bush, 

I am a parent of a child currently attending a magnet school in Palm Beach County Florida with a second child getting ready to enter kindergarten in the fall.  I am also an employee of the public school system and can not imagine doing anything else.  The education budget as proposed places both of my children's schooling on the chopping board.  As a parent and an educator I see daily the important role these programs serve.  Without kindergarten programs there will be hundreds, no, more likely thousands of five year olds missing out on the opportunities afforded to other five year olds across our country.  They are so eager to learn and their minds are so open to new things.  It is a sad situation to be in to not be able to provide them the educational support they need to someday be able to compete in the world we are creating for them to live in.  Special programs such as magnets, as well as sports and fine arts also provide opportunities for students who may need something just a bit different than the traditional setting.  You advocate choice yet our choices are vanishing right before our eyes.  Please consider the kids for they will be the ones who pay the price.

Your consideration is appreciated,

Linda A. Guzman

Dear Governor Bush,
    I urge you to veto the bills(SB 626 and HB1893) coming before you
regarding the Everglades Comprehensive Restoration Project. As a Florida
resident and registered Republican, I am sickened that you would
jeopardize the 50% Federal funding for the Everglades Restoration by
buckling under to the special interest of Big Sugar. Of course, their
largess around our capitol and the nation's has bought them a very
'sweet' deal in subsidies which keep sugar prices inflated and limits
competition. Beyond lining their pockets at the expense of the American
taxpayer, they are seeking to avoid responsibility for the destruction
of the Everglades. If this legislation goes through, it will put a knife
in what a recent speaker called "the liquid heart of Florida." Not only
do the Everglades constitute a unique feature of our state, but properly
managed they will provide drinking water for South Florida. Agricultural
interests must be made to comply with and the State must enforce the
water quality standards set out in the original legislation. No deadline
extension should be granted. If we lose the Federal Funding, the
Everglades will not recover-ever. Apparently, the Department of
Environmental Protection and the South Florida Water Management district
have bought big Sugar's rationalization that 'close enough is good
enough.' It is not.You, as the Governor of the State, have a
responsibility to protect our State from shortsighted special interests
and to build a record of independent and responsible management of the
unique environmental, economic and touristic treasure that is the
Everglades. The future of South Florida depends on our State's enforcing
water quality compliance, guaranteeing the Federal matching funds and
the gratitude of all for a healthy and beautiful Everglades AND a supply
of water for South Florida.

Sincerely,
Anne C. Pepper

Gentlemen:
 
When a city can not pick up garbage during peace time, how do you expect it to pick up Iraqi garbage? I carried some cement over - pour to the curb. I am 52 yrs old with a bad back. Today the garbage men refused to pick it up. After 2 calls to 630-city, I learned that the compliance adjuster does not work after 4pm.  He can not meet me after I get home from work at 5pm. However the lady at 630 - city wants my work phone number so that the compliance adjuster can bother me at my work. This is a case of the tail wagging the dog. This is wrong!  I am a Republican and I'm sure I pay more taxes than the garbage men. I'm also sure if I can lift the parcels at my age, with my back, work men should be able to lift the parcels! 
 
Please insure a timely pick up.
 
Thank you,

As a citizen of our wonderful state I urge all of you vote NO on the above bills.
The current Workman's Compensation law is bad enough without giving employers more and the working person less.
I was injured in an unusual accident in November of 2002. Because of the type of injuries I have, it is taking several different types of health care providers to assist me in regaining my health. If these bills are passed it make more difficult for me to find good, quality, healthcare. 
I realize that not only are healthcare cost continually going up but insurance costs are as well. Why not look at the real reason these costs are skyrocketing.
When a hospital charges $5.00 for an Advil that costs them .02 them that's a lot of profit!
look at what the insurance companies are doing with their premiums.
My wages have not gone up anywhere near as fast as healthcare and insurance costs.
Currently Workman's Compensation pays me only 60% my salary. Why?
I have never planned on being injured. And I want to assure you that, at 56 years old, I would rather be productive and healthy than injured.
Please listen to the working person and not the big business.
Thank you for your time.

MEDICALLY NEEDY WILL RALLY
AT GOVERNOR BUSH'S MANSION






On May 19 people with mental illnesses and their supporters will converge on the Governor's Mansion in Tallahassee, 700 North Florida Ave., at 2:30 PM. 
They're saying, "We are desperate!"

Thousands of people with mental illnesses have watched helplessly as our state hospitals have closed.  The legislature has heartlessly gutted rehabilitation and housing programs.  And now those same lawmakers are cruelly eliminating Florida's Medically Needy Program -- with a wanton disregard for many people's need for life giving medications.

As one person with a psychiatric disability said, "The state is taking away our life support system without our permission. It's like they're killing us off!"

Florida's Legislature has abandoned us. Now we have nowhere to turn! 
So we are marching directly to Governor Jeb Bush's home.

Yes, we expect him to champion the needs of his state's most vulnerable citizens.

Without his intercession -- his compassionate conservatism -- many of us will slide back into the living hell of madness. To us, our medications are absolutely a matter of life or death. It's sanity or insanity!

And if people are left untreated, the costs to our society will be infinitely greater than funding this Medically Needy Program.

COME MARCH WITH US   
Let your voices be heard on May 19!

Rally sponsored by: The Florida Drop-in-Center Association and Consumer Support Services of Jacksonville. We welcome other organizations and people to join us. For further information call Steve Kersker in St. Petersburg at (727) 823-8404 or Dave Shaver in Jacksonville at (904) 354-2511.

Donations are needed for our bus rental - $1800 total for 57 people to travel by bus from St. Petersburg to Tallahassee, meals included.  Please, help us if you can: send your donation to Florida Drop-in-Center Association, 118 6th Ave. No. #201, St. Petersburg, Florida 33701. -- YOU MIGHT ASK WHY IS STEVE KERSKER ORGANIZING THIS RALLY? Read on and you'll see why:  Fifteen phone calls! That's the number displayed on my caller ID Friday night - and all of them from one caller. 

Stacey Pope was frantic. "When I went to the pharmacy today to pick up my meds, the pharmacist told me that these were my very last prescriptions -- from now on, each month I'd have to pay $459 to pick up my meds."  Steve she sobbed, "that leaves me with just $450 to live on each month."

Stacey was terrified. "How am I going to pay my rent and buy food if I have to spend almost all my income on medications?"

I had no answer for my friend. Like so many other people with severe disabilities,
Stacey had fallen victim to the proposed elimination of Florida's Medically Needy Program - a program that for many years has helped with prescription and medical bills for some of Florida's poorest and sickest residents. 

No immediate answer didn't mean we were helpless, though. Some action had to be taken, and fast. So here's my first response to my friend's plight. 

Yes, it's a flyer, distributed by both e-mail and snail-mail, to over 15,000 interested citizens. SEE YOU AT THE GOVERNOR's MANSION!

If the words national security have ever been breathed into the universe by me or in electronic print it is not in connection with this agreement in the technical aspect mentioned here, but only in the sense that Dr. Cooper's Aerobic Center helps keep America fit and thus more secure, nationally that is.
To allay any misgivings whatsoever I am here clarifying the intent of the agreements, especially in the sense of the phrase national security matters  as are handled by Ms. Rice, and what we'll be doing, which has nothing to do with what she or the President are concerned with as national security.


     It is my intention that all agreements for which I am a responsible party will provide the same in the context in which we are speaking. Directly, simple and straight forward. 

     The language will be as you advise to accomplish this, and as you and your firm will be first sight to the page you will know and be able to steer in the direction we are all seeking and insure to content.

     Barry, I hope this puts this aspect away, but more over, I am not a Citizen of any country other than America and do not plan on changing that status. It is my understanding, that the provisions of the EXXON v Florio (I hope I got that right) would not apply for that reason alone, together with of course the one of exclusion just mentioned of NO NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES BRINGING THE AGREEMENT(S) WITHIN NATIONAL SECURITY FOR THE CHEIF EXECUTIVE!

     As I have just, today, receive an invitation from Enterprise Florida as sponsor for an event which just might bring our efforts to realization, G-d willing,
I am looking forward to continuing. 

     Please help me.

     All the best, and
   
     Very respectfully,



     Steve

Please protect Florida's unborn children the "Florida Civil Rights Act"

The vast majority of Americans (80%), are opposed to allowing their

Subject:	Bills to increase telephone rates

Dear Gov. Bush,

     According to the April 28th edition of the Daytona News Journal two bills are in the Legislature to increase phone rates. (HB1903 and SB654). The article says you are prepared to sign the bill that comes through.

     This is the same legislation you vetoed last year when you were running for reelection. I used your veto as a talking point when I worked for you last summer and Fall. I see no reason for you to change your position.

     According to the paper, the bill would increase basic monthly rates by $3. to$7.25 over the next four years. After that, RATES COULD INCREASE BY TWENTY PER CENT EVERY YEAR. That is absolutely not in the public interet.

     The phone company is using the same hog wash as they did last year when you vetoed the bill. Raising rates will bring increased profits which will bring increased competition which will eventually lower costs for the consumer. If you believe that I know of a few bridges for sale.

     According to the article, the bill is largely crafted by phone company lobbysts. If this is the case it is a GIVEN that the public will not benefit.

     This proposed legislation is definitely not consumer friendly nor is it something you can point to with pride when you run for another office. I urge you to veto whatever bill comes thorugh and give the voter a break.

Subject: DeMint Q and A

What does the DeMint amendment do?

 

The amendment encourages states to develop new, innovative systems that
promote customization of special education.  It permits IDEA research and
innovation dollars to be voluntarily used by states to research and develop
new education systems that empower parents of disabled children.  Giving
states the flexibility to develop new and innovative approaches to serving
the needs of disabled children will help those children receive the
customized and truly special education they need to succeed.

The second part of the amendment allows those states that already have a
customized, innovative program in place to use their federal IDEA funds
along with the state money for the program.  

 

Why is this amendment necessary?

            

Instead of meeting the needs of those children that are truly disabled,
special education is becoming a label for every child that learns
differently or has not been taught basic skills.   Nearly one in eight U.S.
schoolchildren is currently considered disabled.  As a result, education for
truly disabled children is become less and less special.  

In too many cases, parents of disabled children may not receive adequate
services for their children if they are not in a financial position to
threaten litigation against the school.  The complex and adversarial nature
of IDEA discriminates against low-income families who often do not have the
resources to navigate the system.  All parents deserve the ability to push
for the education that is best for their special needs child.  We must give
states the flexibility to offer these options to parents.  

 

Is the DeMint amendment a voucher?

 

            No.  The DeMint plan merely allows states the voluntary
opportunity to develop new education systems that promote customization and
empower parents to find the best education for their disabled child.    

            This amendment gives states the flexibility to develop a program
that will work best for them.  The only requirements are that the program
apply to children that are disabled, be made available to children who have
been in the public school system for the current year, and that the parent
be empowered with decision making.     

 

Does Mr. DeMint support the general IDEA bill?

 

            Yes.  Mr. DeMint's amendment is meant to enhance the larger IDEA
reauthorization and reform bill.  H.R. 1350 will make much-needed reforms to
special education law and improve results for children with disabilities.
The significant reforms proposed in the bill include critical paperwork
reduction for special education teachers, improved early-intervention
strategies, and dramatic funding increases.  The bill will reduce
misidentification of special needs students and restore trust between
parents and districts by reducing litigation.

Dear Governor Bush,
I am writing to you because I am concerned that yet again in order to reform Workers Compensation, big business and state goverment is again blaming the workers for the problems within the system.  Your solution to the problem is to again cut the benefits to the workers or deny health care to the worker. This will make it harder for the worker to get what he or she is entiled too. 
NCCI is a monopoly, is funded by the insurance companies,
and their report to the state on workers comp. rate hikes is based on what? Because their books are exempt from outside review, there is no way for the state to question their request or recommendations. This is wrong, and leaves the door open for NCCI to cook their books in favor of the insurance companies. It looks like another Enron deal to me. It goes back to the old saying, "If it walks like a duck, sounds like a duck, and looks like a duck, then it must be a duck."   I'am against these two bills, and I will be watching to see who votes for them and who is really wanting to help the people or help their own agenda.  Mr. Bush,  I know last year you set up a task force.   I'am sure there were people who were well informed in business.  In order to correct the problems, I think everyone should be represented.  I'd be willing to bet that on your task force, there was not a person who has had to live through the ordeal of being injured and not being able to work and then having to deal with the system. The problems cannot be fixed if everyone's point of view is not involved.
                  Thank you for your time.

Subject:	ETHICS VIOLATIONS OF TED EDWARDS, AGAINST BITHLO COMMUNITY RESIDENTS.

To the hand of TED EDWARDS,
 
As you are aware, a secret meeting has been scheduled for this Thursday at 7:00 p.m. at the government center in Bithlo Florida. I have been made aware of this meeting by one of a select few who were notified by mail this week and noticed that your name appears on this secret notice, which no one else has been provided a copy of, including the elected community representative, other than those you choose to allow to dictate and control our community affairs.
 
This letter will serve as official notice that should you permit this secret meeting to occur as scheduled and you do not provide this writer a copy of the minutes of the meeting and the opportunity to cast an absentee ballot for any vote, decision, selection or election, I will have no choice other than to file a complaint with the Florida Ethics Commission, similar to the one I recently was forced to file on several members of the Lynx board.
Your violation is for misuse of public position. 
(Public officers and employees, and local government attorneys are prohibited from corruptly using or attempting to use their official positions to obtain a special privilege for themselves or others. Section 112.313(6) Fla. Stat.)
 
Naturally, if you permit only a select few oligarchs to vote upon any matter, or to hold a secret and unadvertised meeting not open to the entire community, (for any reason) this would constitute a violation of not only the Commission on Ethics, but also a deprivation of my communities constitutional rights, which carry severe penalties for violation of.
As an attorney, I am sure you are aware that" Where rights secured by the constitution are involved, there can be no rule making or legislation which would abrogate them. MIRANDA vs. ARIZONA 384 U.S. 436,491"
 
I have been made aware by staff of the neighborhood services division that you ordered this secret meeting
and if Bithlo residents have a problem with allowing a select few "good ole boys" to dictate community affairs I should take it up with you.
 
Please be advised that I have provided a petition to Congressman Tom Feeney which was signed by a majority of Bithlo residents and clearly states that they have voted to elect a Community Representative.
Your attempt to undermine the wishes of the majority clearly smacks of anti-Americanism and territorial dictatorship.
It would be noble of you to stop this humiliating and degrading treatment of residents and order the secret meeting canceled unless full public participation is permitted. This can only occur at a neutral meeting place where all are welcome and feel comfortable, The First Baptist Church of Bithlo.Pastor Frank Stevenson has been made aware of past difficulties at the government center and the oligarchy which has been created by TOM KING, GEORGE NIGHTINGALE and DEBBY ASKA, among others.
It is for this reason that Pastor Stevenson has offered the sanctuary of the church as a meeting place for the community. You should be aware that TOM KING has rejected the house of God as unacceptable for community meetings and has caused quite a bit of concern within the community, since TOM KING is not a resident of the community and appears to be anti-Christian as well.
 
As a fourth generation resident of the area, I am appalled and speak for the entire community when I say that this must stop! In God we trust... not TOM KING! None but an enemy of the people would support or permit this to continue and I am graciously offering you this opportunity to correct this problem before it festers and spreads like the cancer it has become for our once great community.
 
However, if you feel it necessary to hold a secret meeting on Thursday night, please be advised that Friday morning I will file numerous complaints and grievances with various agencies and organizations in order to correct this problem. Also be advised that this letter is being prepared for inclusion into this years consolidated plan for 2003-2004, and will be submitted under public comments as provided for in the Federal Register.
I am willing to with hold these comments if you are willing to with hold the meeting Thursday night or in the alternative provide an absentee ballot for my constituents and myself. ( App. 350 +or- )
 
Further, please take this opportunity to inform County Attorney , George Dorsett, that his terrorist threats made to me by sending unsolicited letters to my address clearly violates my rights to religious freedom. I have made this person aware of my desire to be free from his threats, yet, he continues to harass me and keep me in sheer abject terror by his continuing hate mail.Further contact with this writer by Dorsett will result in additional complaints to the Florida Bar. The embarrassment of this action need not be told in this letter.
 
Again, I do not expect you to do what is right, but I certainly will not excuse it.
 
Sincerely,
Cory E. Goodman, Chairman

I have voted for you every time and George W. once. I appreciate you, your service and your stance on issues. I have not emailed you in the past but this is something I'm very concerned about.
 
Please stop Senate Bill 1214 titled the “Florida Civil Rights Act”. My understanding is that this bill will require employers and insurance companies to pay for abortion.
 
I will pray for you as I do all of our leaders, and I trust you will make ever effort to save lives rather than destroy them as abortion does.

Chairman Petway and fellow BoG members,

I would like to propose that we include in the agenda item "Discussion
of Board Structure and Process" the topic of the process of selecting
the Chancellor.  This is an authority that pretty clearly should reside
with the Board of Governors, and that has not been delegated (nor, in my
opinion, should it be) to another entity.  It might be best if this
discussion were held before the Chancellor-Designate's report.  In fact,
there also needs to be some discussion and clarification about even the
title, given the March 24 press release sent by Bill Edmonds (see
below).  It raises some question about whether the BoG would be better
off with its own communications contact, to prevent future appearances
of conflict of interest.

Thanks,
Richard

PRESS RELEASE
FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION
MARCH 24, 2003

Florida Department of Education Names Dr. Debra Austin
as Chancellor of Colleges and Universities

TALLAHASSEE - Florida Education Commissioner Jim Horne announced today
that Dr. Debra Austin has been named as Florida's new Chancellor of
Colleges and Universities. Dr. Austin has spent close to the last 25
years working in higher education, and brings a wealth of talent,
experience and dedication to the Department of Education. A photograph
of Dr. Austin is attached.

"Florida's colleges and universities are blessed to have someone of
Debra's caliber at their helm," stated Horne. "Not only is she a
national leader in higher education, but she also has been a leader in
her state and community. I am very pleased by her appointment, and I
look forward to working with her to help make Florida's colleges and
universities the best in the world."

Thomas F. Petway III, chairman of the Florida Board of Governors, which
oversees the state universities, said Dr. Austin will be instrumental in
implementing the important changes and reforms initiated by Governor Jeb
Bush. "Debra has a reputation as a gifted leader and administrator,"
Petway said. "Her good judgment is a great asset to the university
system, and I very much look forward to working with her to help our 11
institutions grow stronger and to guide them into the future."

Dr. Austin is currently an Assistant Vice President for Academic Affairs
at Florida State University. She began her career as an English
instructor at Lake-Sumter Community College in Leesburg. Since then, she
has served in numerous academic administrative positions, from division
head to chief academic officer to Acting President at Tallahassee
Community College.

"It is indeed an honor to be selected as the Chancellor of Colleges and
Universities for the State of Florida," stated Austin. "As in all
states, higher education in Florida faces many challenges, but there are
also many opportunities to showcase our colleges and universities as the
world-class institutions they are. I can think of no greater
professional honor than to serve as an advocate for institutions that
produce outstanding graduates, engage in exceptional research, serve as
economic development engines for the 21st century and provide enormous
service to our communities."

Dr. Austin earned a bachelor's degree in English from Michigan State
University, a master's degree in English from the University of Florida,
a master's degree in business administration from Florida State
University, and the doctorate in higher education from Florida State
University. She also holds an honorary doctorate from Flagler College in
St. Augustine.  She is a member of several national, statewide and local
organizations, including the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc. and
Leadership Florida, an organization dedicated to improving the lives of
Florida citizens. She serves on the Knight Foundation Community Advisory
Committee and as Second Vice President on the Board of Directors for the
Tallahassee Urban League. A member of Bethel A.M.E. Church, Dr. Austin
is married and has two daughters.

Mr. Bush,
My family and I recently moved here from Connecticut
to escape the extreme liberalism of the Northeast.  My
wife and I are moderate on most issues, and would like
our children to grow up and form their own opinions.  
However, while the rights of all individuals need
protection, the rights of unborn babies also need our
most urgent attention, as they cannot speak for
themselves.  It is up to our clear thinking elected
leaders to speak for us, and for these children. 
Please show the courage your brother has shown in
standing up for what he knows is the right thing to
do.  Do not allow Senate Bill #1214 to be passed into
law, if only to discourage more abortions of these
unborn children.  Every child deserves to be at least
born and given the opportunity to live free in God's
world and our wonderful country.

Thank you,

Dear Governor Bush:

My wife and I have been lifelong Republicans, and I come from a family of
Republicans.  We have lived in Palm Beach, Florida for over 24 years.  We
care deeply about this state.  We voted for you. As such, we are deeply
troubled by your apparent support for a bill to roll back the agreement,
reached by all the parties, several years ago, to clean up the Everglades
and to do it on a timetable everyone supported.  This bill is clearly
nothing but a grab by the sugar industry--an industry that continues to
block every reasonable attempt to force it to clean up its own mess.  Every
major industry in this country: manufacturing, timber, utilities,
automobiles, has cleaned up its effluent, has put scrubbers in its
smokestacks, and has replanted trees when they finish logging.  Why can't
the sugar industry do the same?  This bill was penned by the sugar
industry's lobbyists. It benefits only them (how many jobs are we really
talking about compared to the drinking water for all of South Florida, and
water for the entire Everglades system?).  Your support for this bill
continues the myth that Republicans don't care about the Environment.
Everyone cares about the environment, Democrats and Republicans alike.  But
if you fail to see how this bill will erode your traditional support, you
are blind to reality.  Your support for this bill continues the myth that
Republicans are the party of business and the wealthy.  We don't need this,
and you don't need this.

Ask yourself why the Florida Republican delegation in Washington is opposed
to this bill.  Ask yourself why every environmental organization in Florida
opposes this bill.  Ask yourself why virtually every newspaper in Florida
editorializes against this bill.  Ask yourself why it appears that Sugars'
$800,000 in political contributions are driving this bus.

Do the right thing for all of Florida.  Veto the bill and tell the sugar
industry you aren't in its pocket.  Its time someone did.  If you don't, you
can be assured that Republicans who care about the Environment (and there
are alot of us) won't be there for the Republican party in the future.  The
Future of Florida depends on a clean Everglades done on the original
timetable and with water quality standards set by serious science.

Subject:	Education budget crunch - urgent!

Importance:	High

Dear Governor Bush,
    First of all I want to let you know I and my family are Republican and moved here a year ago from the state of Texas where your brother was Governor!
I have the utmost respect for both you , our President and your family.  Thank God for having you as our Governor and your brother as our President in these trying times.  
   I do understand we are facing an overall budget crunch for the great state of Florida.  Unfortunately, all areas will be hit.  The crunch on the education
of our children is the most worrisome, though.  Both my children have and will be hurt severely with the crunch of numbers for the coming year in education spending.  I do understand the state voted on smaller class sizes and that has had a great impact, yet the future of our children are at stake here.  Only through a continued effort can our children's education get better here.  We live in the Palm Beach school district which will be severely hurt with  the reduction of funds.  I am not very happy with what I have seen here locally yet am still not well enough informed to yet totally pass judgment.  I do know for certain though, the reduction of funds will greatly hurt my 11th graders education.  Chris is gifted in the arts as well as in academics.  His school,
Dreyfoos School of the Arts, which has offered him a high quality education,  may no longer exist if the budget cuts go through.  He is receiving a much better education at the School of the Arts than he was from the local high school.  It is scary to even think of his having to return there.  He is going to visit the Legislature with his school tomorrow along with other students, parents and teachers from his school , this is such an important matter to us all.  PLEASE rethink the budget for 2003-04!
My older son Alan, (freshman in college)  lost out on the Bright Scholar's Scholarship as they would not allow him to take his last semester of sign language over the summer as it was not offered at his school when we transferred here. (by the way, he is extremely gifted in this area and probably exceeded most students at the end of their 2nd and 3rd year !)   Not only is he gifted in sign language, he is also gifted in the arts as well.  He is enrolled at New World School of the Arts in Miami and has been told they don't know if they will have the money to remain open next year and if so, they will probably not have scholarship money available, even though the Dean of the Visual Arts is recommending him for one, because of his gift and dedication.  This young man is paying his way as we cannot afford to help him at this time and daily rides the Tri-rail & Metro-rail from Palm Beach to get to school, leaving the house as early as 3:45 AM to get to class on time, as well as works 2-3 days a week.  This young man  deserves a quality education and  is an asset to the State of Florida.   Alan chose New World over several other schools which would have given him a scholarship out of state, but he loves Florida and wants to remain here.  
    The Arts may not seem important to some, but the impact on our daily lives is around us everywhere.  The Arts are responsible for the fine architecture we see in this beautiful State;  fine advertising is only possible through quality art education; our clothes we wear are a result of art education;  murals, paintings, sculptures; the State web pages are an example of art education; memorials are designed by artists, the list goes on.  Through quality of art education and academics, every aspect of our lives are effected.
   Alan and Chris are outstanding young men that could become  great leaders one day and I hate to think of their leaving Florida only because they can't get the education they deserve here.    
    Please consider their future as well as that of all the other deserving kids of this great State.  Let their voices be heard!!!!

Senate Bill 1214 titled the “Florida Civil Rights Act” passed the Florida
Senate and is headed to the House of Representatives. This bill, if
passed, amends the Florida Civil Rights Act of 1992. 
THE BILL WILL REQUIRE ALL STATE PAID AND EMPLOYER PAID HEALTH INSURANCE
IN FLORIDA TO PAY FOR HEALTH INSURANCE BENEFITS FOR ABORTIONS!

Please register our opposition to tax dollars being used to kill innocent
life and provide abortion on demand.   We are trusting you to stand firm
on the pro-life position on which you campaigned. This legislation is not
a civil right.

Sincerely,
Roger E. Coon

Dear Governor,
       As a Catholic and human being of high moral standards,  I am opposed to all abortion. As a republican, I am Very Opposed  to taxpayer funded abortion on demand. It is a tough enough battle to undo legal abortion, but mandating funding of this horrific act against humanity just might turn me into an activist. I beg you to be high minded and do the right thing.

Dear Governor Bush,

I understand there is a major shortage for the budget, however, please do
not cut (or cut as little as possible) from education.  Full-time
kindergarten, teachers aides and high school sports are especially
important!  If we cut full-time kindergarten, we are sending the message
that young children are not worth our time and money...which is far from the
truth!  They are the future of Florida and kindergarten-age children are
very impressionable!  Also, high school sports is crucial to teenagers.  If
these after school activities were cut or taken away completely, that could
mean disaster for our society as a whole.  Sports are an excellent way to
keep our children active, healthy and out of trouble.

PLEASE DO NOT CUT FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS!

Sincerely,
Concerned mother, wife, student and full-time paralegal,

Gov,

Just got back from Rod Paige's race neutral conference in Miami (yes, they
did invite me and I wasnt crashing!!).  It was pretty interesting
assembly -- many university presidents and/or professors interested in
subject.  All the Florida speakers did a good job.  California was still
complaining about being race-neutral.  Texas was more matter of fact -- its
here, we did it, its working.  In other words, the passion in Florida to
make this program work showed compared to the other big states.

On a side note, David Colburn spoke very nicely about you during his
presentation.  He noted that before you put their feet to the fire, they
were not doing their job.  They were relying solely on preferences and that
was not good and that was not enough.  He really gave you the credit for
creating a whole cultural change at UF and for making it a better place for
minorities.

Governor Bush,

I wouldn't expect you to remember me, but we have met casually on several
occasions.  I am the President of AmSouth Bank in Ocala and an avid
supporter of yours and the Republican Party.  With the recent announcement
of Jim Warford's appointment, there has been a lot of discussion and
speculation surrounding the naming of his replacement for his remaining
term.  Most assume that Jim Yancey will be his successor.  I have heard
rumblings, however, that there will be a major attempt to sway your
decision toward Evelyn Kelly.  This would be a tragedy.  I know you are
aware that Jim Yancey has been a major force in implementing the changes to
our school system, all positive.  He is the natural one to carry out the
programs set forth under Jim Warford's leadership.  I know I am not telling
you anything you don't already know.  I just hope, regardless of the
political clout that the Kelly camp is able to muster, that you will make
the appointment that will be most beneficial to our schools and our
students.  Jim Yancey, in my opinion, is the only one that can sustain the
programs with minimal impact to the progress that has already been made.

Thank you for allowing me to express my opinion and my support for Jim
Yancey.

Sincerely,

Subject:	Tax-funded abortion

Dear Jeb,
You're doing a great job!
Abortion is one of America's most divisive issues. There certainly is not a
strong consensus on the issue. George Gallup, Jr. says 20% of Americans are
strongly pro-life and 20% are strongly pro-choice, and that 60% are in the
"mushy middle" and you can get them to be reported as pro-life or pro-choice
depending on what you ask.
Despite the complete lack of a consensus, a large majority of Americans
(80%) do NOT agree with FUNDING abortions with our tax-dollars. I am
certainly among the 80%. Please do not force me, against my conscience, to
pay for the taking of the life of the unborn. Any way you look at it,
abortion always results in a dead body. I agree with Mother Teresa's
observation---that there is a link in our society between abortion and
violence. She said, "And if we can accept that a mother can kill ever her
own child, how can we tell others not to kill one another?" But, again, it's
one thing to be opposed to abortion in general (which I am), it's another
thing to make me pay for it in my taxes. We're already way overtaxed these
days as it is. Thanks for hearing me out.

Subject:	Important!

Governor Bush,

I am writing to you today over concern that the Florida Legislature is not doing
everything it can to provide adequate funding for our schools. It is very apparent
to me that the voters of Florida have put education as their number one priority.
This is evident in the recent passing of the amendments for Pre-K and smaller
class sizes throughout our state.

Last year, my students made significant gains in their FCAT scores, and I was
recognized by the School District of Palm Beach for doing so. I cannot imagine
being able to accomplish this again if you, as Governor, don’t make it a priority
to invest in our children’s future. Each year as an elementary school teacher
we have additional tasks asked of us. Yet, each year we have to struggle to
get adequate funding for our basic needs. If it is necessary to raise taxes
to provide adequate funding then have some backbone and do it. You may worry
about the economy, but if companies see that our state is committed to investing
in our children then they will invest in our state by moving here. Obviously,
this will provide for more jobs as well as revenue.

I use this quote with my students to motivate them to do there best. It’s by
George Herbert – “ It’s never too late to be who you might have been.” Will
you please consider being a leader for education, instead of a follower of flawed
policies? You ask us as educators to teach our students so that they will learn
and pass onto the next grade. Please take the time to pass a budget that will
enable us to do so.

Thank you in advance for you kind consideration.

Sincerely,

Good evening Governor.  My name is Ron Reid, living in Lutz.  I was taken aback by comments that you made to me in response to an e mail that I sent to you last week regarding the cuts in staff in the education system down here in Hillsborough and Pinellas etc.  I was taken aback because you stated that you had not seen news on the cuts that are going to be taking place.  That was shocking to me  because you as our highest elected official in the state should be abreast of current events especially in dealing with budgetary issues in education.  This was one of the top 5 issues you campaigned on.  I have a letter that was sent home by my daughters elementary school principal outlining the upcoming cuts and if you would like me to send you a copy so you could see the people and programs who could be effected.  This is why I said the time has come for a state tax, your a big guy you can take the political heat to do the right thing.  After all these people who voted in the class size amendment and the pre K amendment don't understand fiscal responsibility and they definitely did not know what they were going to get the state into financially.  
I am also writing to ask you to please don't pay polluters but make them pay.  Don't utilize my tax dollars to clean up their mess in the glades if it was caused by corporations. Thank you for your attention, Ronald B Reid

Dear Tamara:

It's has been several months since General Patrol has been contacted from anyone in the Defense Department regarding the close out of our contract.  Our employees have not received the bonuses they are entitled to and the Defense Department has not made any attempt in negotiating the finalization of the contract as you stated in your previous e mail, "we are in the negotiation process."  General Patrol is willing to reach a settlement regarding the hourly rate.  In order to settle, we would like to request the figures used in the Pricing Proposal's formula to compute the hourly rate.  Based on our calculations and company's figures, the $16.25 rate is too low and should be increased to $20.00 per hour.  Mr. Tony Valenti from your office, worked with my accountant and has in his possession of General Patrol 's figures which when plugged into the formula increases the hourly rate to $20.00 per hour.  If those figures are no longer available, please send us a new Modification reflecting the $20.00 hourly rate for the preboard screener and the corresponding new rates for the supervisors and manager, and we will sign it and return it to you as soon as possible.  Once we have signed the new Modification, then the PLB can be issued along with the bonuses.  

There are several invoices pending which have been submitted for payment several months ago which total approximately $15,758.07.  These invoices are outstanding and are payable upon receipt.  Along with those invoices, there's an invoice in the amount of $245,877.00 for the government's liability.  This invoice does not reflect the increases for the months of August, September, October and November.  Once I receive the monthly increase to the award amount, I will submit an additional invoice for those amounts.  At this time, we are requesting that the outstanding invoices be paid immediately.  

In addition, when the Defense Department took over the contracts, the monthly award increases were not forwarded to our office.  We are missing the award increases for the month of August, September, October, and November.  Please forward the total of those increases as soon as possible.  

I have been in contact with our legislative representatives who will be submitting letters and telephone calls on our behalf to help speed up the process of finalizing this contact.

If you are no longer involved in this matter, and/or if there is a freeze on payments to the invoices, etc., please advise me.  

Thank you for your patience and anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Tom-As indicated by phone, herein an op-ed piece proposed for the Herald.  It has not been, and will not be, shopped elsewhere.  This is the Herald’s issue.  Please note that I know how to properly spell divers(though you may feel free to edit to the more vulgar, improper usage).  Hope to see you in Sarasota.
 
 
DRAFT OP ED PIECE
J. Allison DeFoor, II
 
 
 
Words will not save America’s Everglades.  Not words of harsh political rhetoric. Not words said in a courtroom.  Not words in a legislative enactment. And certainly not words plastered up on a mean-spirited billboard that falsely attack an individual who has given his entire adult life to saving the Everglades.
 
What will save the Everglades are hard work, money, and most importantly, consensus.
 
After he was elected in 1998, Governor Jeb Bush made restoration of the Everglades an immediate and major priority.  Within 18 months, a broad consensus between agricultural, urban and environmental interests was achieved.  Divers parties, ranging from state, local and national interests, even to sovereign Indian nations, all agreed to work together on the massive restoration effort.  
 
The results were spectacular!  First and foremost, the plan for restoration was rolled out in Washington DC to unanimous support.  Funding for this $8 billion 40-year project was secured at first the state, then the federal level.
 
The results on the ground are dramatic as well. 
 
*        Nearly 80 percent of the land needed for the initial authorized projects has been acquired.
*        The first 10,000 acre-feet of water storage are available now – seven years ahead of schedule.
*        An agreement signed by both Florida and the federal government ensures water will be reserved for the environment.
 
These hard-fought achievements occurred with a backdrop of some tough realities.  
Rhetoric can’t sway science or accelerate nature.  We were 100 years getting into this hole and we will be a while getting out of it.  
 
Of all human uses of land near the Everglades, sugar is the most benign.  It is enormously less than harmful than sub urbanization – which would no doubt result from a rapid displacement of sugar farms North of the marsh.  Cities generate more pollution than raising sugar.  An explosion of new development would have disastrous consequences for water quality in the Everglades.  Anyone who questions this outcome should consider fate of Orange County, California, which quickly urbanized after its agricultural industries were displaced.
 
Those now engaged in the harshest rhetoric are not part of the hard work that has achieved so much to date.  Indeed, they have sought all along to undermine the consensus.  Notably, the Sierra Club is currently litigating an issue – completely unrelated to the Everglades – in such a way as they block $100 million a year in funding for restoration.  Some are masters of the old Southern game of “what don’t you and him fight.”  
 
Everyone agrees that the unraveling of the consensus is the biggest enemy to Everglades’s restoration.  Yet, the people who recognize this danger are the same ones who are causing it to become a reality.  The test for everyone involved in this historic effort is whether they can put aside their own deep-seeded distrust of other interests for the benefit of Everglades’s restoration.  It is time to put down the rhetoric, roll up our sleeves, lock arms again, and continue to move forward.

  Dear Governor Jeb Bush
       My son is currently attending Lake Worth High School in the AFJROTC program. I would appreciate it if you would listen to my concern about the magnet programs that may be cut. My son likes the school and all it offers in the AFJROTC magnet . It gives him opportunities that he would never get any where else. Right now, the military needs more people to join, and in the magnet programs, it gives us a chance to learn and get a taste of the military. I am also concerned about the sports programs that may be cut. Without sports, students don't have a way to get stress and anxiety out. With sports, if you go run around, you feel a lot better. Students need a break and just get out and have fun. Sports is a good, chaperoned way to do so. Also, in today's society, a lot of people are obese and that's a problem. America is one of the top countries with weight problems. If you cut the sports, not only will the kids be stressed out but they will be over weight. My parrents voted for you and now it's your turn to keep your promises and help Floridas education systems. We are the future and we need your help.

Dear Governor Jeb Bush,

I am writing on behalf of our future!  The students of America, Florida, and
specially Palm Beach County are at RISK.  Without a solid budget with its top
priority being to fully fund the education of today’s students, tomorrow’s leaders
and workers, Florida is choosing a decline for America.  

Students’ interaction with the tools of tomorrow – technology – will be severely
cut without full funding for Palm Beach County.  Technology has the ability
to directly tutor and support the educational process while increasing a teacher
s instructional time by reducing tedious paperwork and allows more productive
performance by administrators.

Please, do not allow the continually decline of America’s future, support full
educational funding in Palm Beach County and Florida.

We will use all of our creative energies to educate America’s promise.  Please
use yours to fully fund education!

And what about the logic of the situation?

Dear Governor Bush:

  I voted for you for several reasons. I need to see your leadership
concerning Florida's Civil Rights Act.  Please do not disappoint me.You
must stop the House,and have the House let this Act die.  If this
fails,then you must veto the Florida's Civil Rights Act.

Governor, I join the 80% of Americans who oppose taxpayers funding
abortions on demand.  Why should we be made responsible for someone
else's lack of responsibility.  Abstinence is the remedy!

If health insurance companies are mandated to cover abortions on
demand,every ones' health insurance premium will be increased to cover
the present and future costs.  It is not fair to us hard working people
of Florida,who are just making it financially.  Will health insurance
premiums  reach the levels of our auto insurance?  This is why you need
to take action.

Abortionists believe in "free choice".  Abortionist should do abortions
FREE!  These abortionists sell aborted baby parts for over $1,949.00 and
a whole aborted baby for $600.00.

Governor Bush,It is time to protect innocent babies.  One way  to do
this is stop government funding of abortions on demand. The $ 240.9
Million  that Planned Parenthood receives from the government will fund
the Senior Prescription Plan,by using a sliding scale for need,which is
greatly needed. Planned Parenthood made a profit of $466.2 Million since
1987.( This info on Planned Parenthood is from their own annual reports)

Governor Bush, you will be in my prayers. Please show your leadership.
Stop the Civil Rights Act in the House.  If it passes,make certain you
veto it!  Your earliest reply is appreciated.

Governor Bush,
 
I am aware that the funding for education is under deliberation and that my personal school district is in need of funding for the seven hour school day.  Although I am a student and would like nothing more than to get out of school early, I know that the complete school day is vital to my education.  The seventh hour may seem minimal and not worth the money being spent on it.  It is.  The full school day provides a complete education that produces intelligent adults.  We are in the face of danger.  A poorly educated student yields a poorly educated adult; however, an intelligent student grows into an intelligent adult, one who is the future leader, doctor, lawyer, artist, or entrepreneur.  I urge you to consider this.
 
Thank you

Since her retirement she has continued to work to improve education by helping to train new teachers.

Subject: CON Exemptions for Open-Heart Procedures


Hey! We enjoyed your visit last week. There are hospitals seeking a legislative bypass of the CON process because their open-heart CON applications were rejected by AHCA and their subsequent appeals were denied. This isn't their first year to try to get their CON through the legislature, but it appears that this year the legislature will approve their bypass. 

Interestingly enough, while approving open-heart carve outs on one hand in SB 460, the Senate, on the other hand, is in the process of approving SB 2132 that states: "Tertiary health service" means a health service which, due to its high level of intensity, complexity, specialized or limited applicability, and cost, should be limited to, and concentrated in, a limited number of hospitals to ensure the quality, availability, and cost-effectiveness of such service. Examples of such service include, but are not  limited to, organ transplantation, adult and pediatric open-heart surgery...

I know that you are aware that mortality rates in Medicare beneficiaries following coronary bypass procedures in states without CON regulation was higher than in states with CON regulation. Also, in states where CON regulations were repealed, the percentage of patients undergoing bypass surgery tripled in low volume hospitals. 

In the case of open-heart procedures, the free-market philosophy is not in the best interest of the consumers. I encourage your opposition and veto of any bills which permit the legislative bypass of the open-heart CON process. Thanks. William

Subject: Thursday's Celebration of Scholarship Program in Tallahassee
Dear Governor,
 
On Thursday over 1,000 parents and children came to Tallahassee for a “Celebration of Educational Freedom”.  All the children are attending the school of their parents’ choice on the Tax Credit Scholarship Program. They came from such cities as Jacksonville, Pensacola, Orlando, and Tampa, most making a five hour drive. One group even came from Ft. Myers, beginning their trip at midnight the night before. 
 
They were there to give their thanks to you and the legislature for giving them the opportunity to choose the best school, whether public or private. Tom Gallagher, Bev Kilmer and Frank Atkisson thanked the parents for doing the right thing for their children and also for saving the taxpayers money at the same time. 
 
Two moving parent testimonies were heard. Eboni Newman, a single mother from Tampa who earns $17,000 a year, described her daughter who failed 7th grade in public school and displayed severe behavioral problems. With the scholarship she enrolled her in a private school in a low income part of Tampa. “She is a totally different child from were she was last year at this time. I still am involved in the public school my son attends and they are doing a great job meeting his needs.  We are very pleased with that school and the teachers.  My daughter, on the other hand, needed a different educational setting than her assigned public school provided.” said Newman.
 
Carmen Oquendo, a foster mother to two children from a broken home, spoke in Spanish and was assisted by a translator.  “He did not know how to read and he was having lots of problems in the public school. He was so aggressive that he even attacked us in the house sometimes,” said Oquendo of her son. With the scholarship she enrolled him in Peaceforce Academy in Orlando. “In just in 5 months he was reading on a first grade level, his behavior changed drastically and today he needs no medication.” She closed by saying “Please, help poor parents be able to choose the best school for their kids, public or private, just like people with more money do."
 
After the rally all attendees walked the halls of the legislature, visited their own legislators’ offices and filled the galleries of the House and Senate. They were better behaved than the lobbyists working the halls.
 
I know that all these parents would like me to express to you their tremendous gratitude for making this program possible. You are a hero to them. I also want to personally thank you for all you have done for them. Good luck with the rest of the session.
 
Sincerely,
 
John Kirtley

Trauma doctors announce pullout from Halifax hospital 

By MATT GRIMISON 
Staff Writer 

Last update: 29 April 2003 


DAYTONA BEACH -- Lawmakers' inability to deal with skyrocketing insurance rates prompted surgeons to announce Monday that they will stop operating at Halifax Medical Center's trauma unit June 1 -- leaving residents and visitors without the potentially life-saving service.

The six surgeons, who were contracted to operate on the most badly injured patients at the hospital, agreed unanimously to end their relationship with the trauma center, informing Halifax officials in a letter.

They said they are forced to take the step because medical malpractice insurance rates are too expensive to continue the risky surgeries.

The move is a dramatic example of how soaring insurance rates are cutting off access to health care, said Dr. David Ramshaw.

Halifax officials were scrambling Monday to come up with a plan to avoid closing the trauma center, which is the only advanced emergency care facility in Volusia and Flagler counties.

Spokesman John E. Evans said officials have not given up on changing the surgeons' minds but are considering trying to recruit other surgeons to the center.

Evans and Ramshaw both said they hope the Legislature solves the problem by approving a malpractice insurance reform package that includes a $250,000 cap on non-economic damages.

The issue is one of several still unresolved as time runs out in the 60-day legislative session, which was scheduled to end Friday.

A bill supported by the Senate features mandatory insurance rate reductions and gives emergency rooms the "sovereign immunity" lawsuit protection that shields government agencies, but it doesn't have the cap doctors are seeking, which is included in the House version.

Yet Halifax officials said Monday that their trauma surgeons already enjoy a cap of sorts.

Since Halifax is a public hospital that receives tax money, the surgeons are covered by sovereign immunity, which caps award damages at $100,000 per individual and $200,000 per incident. Bigger awards are possible only through a special act of the Legislature.

Evans said he is confused why sovereign immunity, promoted by the Senate and floated as a potential fix for a similar trauma unit crisis in Orlando, is not good enough for the surgeons.

"They don't believe it's enough protection for them, and we have to live with what they tell us," Evans said.

But Ramshaw said the immunity is not ironclad, noting that attorneys have won judgments against doctors who thought they had sovereign immunity protection. Ramshaw said Halifax has refused to give the surgeons written guarantees they would not be subject to paying out lawsuit awards not covered by the sovereign immunity.

Without the trauma surgeons, someone seriously hurt in a car accident would have to be airlifted to Jacksonville, hospital officials said. The extra transport time could mean the difference between life and death for critically injured patients.

Subject: Film office budget


Regarding budgeting for the Florida Film Office....
Florida contains within its boundaries a geography varied enough to allow for filming in a variety of settings.  Additionally, the weather is conducive to nearly year 'round film weather.
Florida has many times flirted with production industry greatness.  Restoring the budget for this office, along with encouraging tax breaks and incentives for film makers is a surefire way to woo film work to Florida on a more regular basis, instead of as sporadically as has occurred over the recent past.   Florida gains no benefit when production goes to other states or countries.
Too many people either cannot leave Florida, or have faith in the potential of its leaders to leave Florida.  You are in a position to reward their loyalty and strength of commitment with a commitment of your own.
Please take the time to make this one of your "pet projects."
It can only benefit everyone here in Florida in the end.  
Thank you for your consideration -

I have been updated on the bills in question and I can not believe what you are doing to the working class people .We are engaged in a war now to help make another country free from dictators and oppressors and to be able to govern themselves as we do.
I know that you sirs, are not working for the people any more, you are working for self-advancement only. The working class people have been working for this country from the beginning , with each new  business that sprang up for the betterment of this Nation , fought and died for it , and getting hurt while working for the company that person is working for, he should be compensated for it because no one ask to be hurt.
A judge in a court of law will tell you that ignorance of the law is not an excuse! Common people like me cannot read the law to its full extent, that’s why we have to hire lawyers that can read, for us, so we wont be ignorant to the laws that are set before us .You know this ,that’s why you are trying to eliminate them,  taking away our right of representation which is unconstitutional !
Do you think that life for us slows down at 62, we wont need as much? At 70, we will not need any compensation at all? I guarantee, your ‘s will be there for you! I’m not saying this just for myself alone, there are many of us out here and it seems that, you are going against all that you were sworn to uphold .
It seems that in one part of world, you will take down oppression to make freedom, then bring it back to us in the form of letting big business and insurance company’s take away ours and become dictators to us.

Subject:	"Quality Improving" - IOM

Mark Taylor reported there are "increased efforts to improve quality", but
the IOM goes on to say, "tens of thousands of patients are dying because
of the care they received in hospitals."

Where is the improvement?  In March, 2001, the IOM said virtually the same
thing (AMNews staff, "...doctors are trying but system needs work")..

With respect to the 20 indicators defined by the IOM, there is still no
change.  In fact, there is no progress on the HealthyPeople 2010
indicators, either.  Sadly, if a poll were conducted, I suspect less than
5% of the adult population would even know such a thing exists.

The idea behind QI is to make sustainable changes in significant ways that
are measurable.  So far, there is no commonly accepted "balanced
scorecard" for holding hospitals accountable for performance.  There is no
transparency of even the ORYX measures of the JCAHO.  The Medicare Cost
report is essentially an "insiders" report, not for public consumption.

Average hospital costs per capita vary between states by an astronomical
amount, from a low of $951 to $5059 (Kaiser Foundation, 2001).

QI teaches as that adherance to "best practice" will reduce variances,
improve quality and reduce costs.  We don't seem to be monitoring our
healthcare system against any benchmarking standard or objective.

The Quality Chasm report (IOM, 2001) endorsed specifically the overarching
statement of purpose proposed by the President’s Advisory Commission: “The
purpose of the health care system is to reduce continually the burden of
illness, injury, and disability, and to improve the health status and
function of the people of the United States.”

By this standard, the existing healthcare system should be transformed to
eliminate the uninsured and underinsured of our country.  The Lewin Group
has done repeated analysis of Universal Healthcare proposals that would
provide BETTER healthcare for ALL Americans at substantially LESS cost
than the nearly 15% of GDP spent currently.

An effective Universal Healthcare plan should be debated throughout our
country within the context described in "Benchmarks of Fairness of Health
Care Reform" by Daniels/Light/Kaplan, 1996.  A community database that
provides citizens with information on "key performance indicators" would
help give Americans the healthcare system we have a right to expect.

Dear Jeb:
 
Enjoyed spending time with you last week.  Wish we had time to do it more often.  You are a great Governor and friend.
 
Attached is the resume of Dr. Neil Euliano (you and I discussed him last week in our meeting) who is seeking appointment to one of the three openings on the Commission on Independent Education.  Neil is an incredibly bright and fine man with awesome knowledge about private educational institutions.  He has been both a financial and personal supporter of our agenda.
 
He has had a very successful career in this field and is liked by many community leaders which is evidenced by his personal endorsements at the bottom of his resume.  I have mentioned Dr. Euliano to Eli several times and I know that Toni Jennings mentioned it to Eli as well.
 
I urge you in the strongest possible way to appoint Dr. Euliano to this board.  You know that I have not asked very often and certainly not made as strong a recommendation in the past.  He will make you proud.

Jeb,
I know I have emailed you before regarding my great concern over SB 460 allowing certain hospitals to avoid the CON requirements, but feel so strongly about this issue that I must reiterate it.
The CON regulations have proven to be of utmost benefit in all States that are regulated this way. The care of patient services cannot be watered down through legislation, in order to circumvent a process that works.
Being a resident of the area being impacted by this ill advised legislation causes me to wonder if the hospitals who have not been able to receive a CON are more concerned about the money than the patients. 
Although I know I should not believe all I read in the newspaper, this morning an article in the Palm Beach Post stated that you would sign this bill.
I am most distressed that this is happening in my backyard and implore you to Veto this bill based on all the facts that prove it would be a detriment to all the citizens involved, as well as regulations that have proven to be successful.

Hi, Gov. Jeb.
I had to pass on this email that was sent out by FL. Citrus Mutual this morning. It speaks for itself, of course.
I certainly shows the lengths to which JD will go to get his slush fund put together!
Bob and I discussed this issue this afternoon. We both agree that even the reduced amount Bob has recommended is the most that can be prudently spent, particularly considering your own efforts on the industry's behalf.
We do not yet know how this will play out over the next four weeks, prior to the Citrus Commission vote at the end of May.
Would you please consider, if necessary, a reluctant request from Bob for a letter addressing your own views as to the necessary funding levels and offering support for continuing his programs at the DOC? I say this request would be made reluctantly because we hate to ask for that kind of favor if it can be avoided. However, JD is clearly mischaracterizing your views and will apparently do whatever else he can to get that fund put together.
Many thanks.

Jeb,
 
I hope you are well. Thank you again for taking part in the Capitol Prayer Rally. We will have all branches of the military involved. A member of the Army asked me today if you would be stopping by their vehicles to say hello  after the rally. They are so proud to serve their country and are excited about being at the Capitol. I was working on the rally and came across this prayer and thought of you. It just seems to fit, if you would like to read a prayer. Your staff said you would make remarks and probably read a scripture, which is great, I just thought I would let you read this prayer and see if you might want to use it. It just seems like something that you would pray. Whatever you decided is fine. Mainly honoring our military in your remarks is the most important thing. Thanks again for having a servant's heart. See you Thursday!

May we balance our concern for justice with a willingness to display mercy, and may our concern for security be tempered with a willingness to take risk which will produce worthwhile change for the good of all people. O Lord,  we pray for Your guidance as we work together for the  best interest of our communities, our nation, our world, and the ultimate goal of peace. When times are prosperous let our hearts be thankful and in troubled times may our deepest trust be in You. Amen.

Dear Governor Bush:

 

Please protect Florida’s unborn children the “Florida Civil Rights Act” will mandate taxpayer-funded abortions in our state.  As a pro-life voter, I do not want my hard-earned tax dollars to be used for the taking of innocent human life.  

 

The vast majority of Americans (80%), are opposed to allowing their taxpayer dollars to be used to pay for abortion on demand, we are no different in Florida.  The government should not be in the business of subsidizing abortions.

 

I voted for you because of your strong pro-life stand, please do not disappoint us, do not allow a vote on the Florida Civil Rights Act!  As our leaders, you have the authority to stop a vote on this pro-abortion bill, please exercise that power to protect innocent unborn children.

Dear Jeb,
 
A friend of mine from Massachusetts has been working with a firm called
AccuRate, a woman owned business from Texas.   From my understanding, this
company checks hospital and doctor bills for errors, then recovers the lost
costs for small self-insured businesses and insurance companies.   They do
this on a commission basis; earning their commission on the amount
recovered.  
 
Currently, the Governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney, is looking at this
program to recover lost funds in the Medicaid program in his state.
According to my friend, the state officials in Massachusetts are very
excited about this program because they feel it could save the state
millions of dollars; plus recover millions already spent and return it to
the state coffers.  
 
For your information, I have attached a couple of the information papers
they have sent to me.   If you feel this program may benefit our state
during this economic downturn, please let me know and I will get more
information to you.
 
I hope this may be helpful.
 
Sincerely,

   I have been thinking more about Florida colleges and universities and was hoping that, if you have time, you could give me your input. What classes do you suggest I take right now in high school and in college? What college do you suggest?

    Once again, I want to thank you for allowing me to be your “Lil Shadow” and I am eagerly anticipating the summer internship. Have a wonderful day and try to keep it as stress-free as possible. Please keep in touch.

I wanted to thank you for allowing Mark Nelson to attend the 6th graduation 
for the faith-based form at Tomoka.  It was a great encouragement to the 
inmate participants and to the citizen volunteers who make the program 
happen. It is extremely humbling to me as a Chaplain that the concept I 
worked to develop with the KAIROS prison ministry five years ago has 
touched the lives of so many and has resulted in eleven similar programs 
within the Department of Corrections.  I really believe such programs have 
been possible because of the foresight of your administration.  Because 
they are volunteer driven they are weathering the financial storm of our 
current economy.

As a manager, I also want to compliment you on what I have seen of the 
People First roll out material through the web casts.  I can hardly wait 
until May 1st when I get to try it for real.  It should do for the 
personnel function what the web based purchasing system has done for 
obtaining materials.  These were two areas that needed to be brought up 
into the 21st century.


I would like to suggest that a similar system be applied to the teacher 
certification process.  I am currently investigating a career change 
because of the new opportunities and great need for teachers in our state. 
 I applied two months ago and my application and transcripts have yet to be 
evaluated.  If the certification process was more like the People First 
application process, the applicant could enter their transcript information 
and the DOE staff could just verify.  Applicants could log in to check the 
progress of their application.  Their are now 6 positions open in my home 
county to teach Social Science and I doubt my certification will be 
approved before the start of school in August.  Just a suggestion for you 
to pass on to the State Board of Education.

Thanks again for all you do.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
Enclosed is an attachment which I have written to both the CEO and the President & Editor of The Saint Petersburg Times.  In actuality it is an indictment of the State of Florida.  Though I am a registered Republican here in Pinellas County I believe that this incident at Eagles Reserve a townhouse development located in Palm Harbor is a serious case of criminal negligence and out right fraud against those occupants.  
 
Though the occupants of this complex are now demonstrating publicly little can be accomplished unless these individuals get their case into court.  Should this happen I am of the opinion if they sue the County and do it in front of a jury, the results will be major. 
 
I am thoroughly amazed that the politicians have not come out in defense of their constituents. I believe their first duty is help the citizens. In my letter I am voicing the opinion that politicians are working for the builders. Unfortunately, you are a politician and am curious what you will do for those who have voted for you.  I do care how many dollars politicians collect without votes they do not get into office. 
 
I am not a resident in this complex nor do I have any financial involvement. I am a concerned citizen.  Please advise me what you are going to do.
 
Yours truly,

Mr. Jeb Bush,
       I would respectively like to inform you of how disappointed I am about this new proposition. My whole life I have dreamed of conforming the perfect resume. I have fulfilled this by getting straight A's for about 97% of my student career, and participating in numerous extra curricular activities, including volleyball and various clubs. If "education is the key," then why would it be the first thing to go in Florida? If we do not have proper fulfillment of our resumes with sports and activities, it will be difficult to find ourselves in the college of our choice. I have dreams to serve in our country's flight squad as a surgeon, and later become a doctor. It will be difficult to obtain the proper education for such a career in a local college. Please, keep in mind my dreams as well as the dreams of my classmates.  Thank you.

Estimado Gobernador Bush, 

La ultima vez que comunicamos fue para dejarle saber sobre el ultimo caso de 
esclavitud que habiamos terminado La Coalicion de Trabajadores de 
Immokalee y el Departamento de Justicia de Los Estados Unidos. 

Hoy dia la esclavitud aqui en Florida el estado que usted representa y gobierna 
sigue siendo noticia al nivel nacional.  Recientemente un articulo del New 
Yorker titulado NOBODIES fechado Abril 21 & 28, 2003 ha sitado a nuestro 
lindo estado del Sol como el punto cero para la lucha en contra la esclavitud 
agricola. 

Creo que no deberia ser solo preocupacion de nosotros los trabajadores el 
tratar de erradicar ese problema, sino deberia de ser un trabajo en conjunto 
con usted como la maxima autoridad de nuestro estado. Ya que como siempre 
le hemos dicho la solucion a este tipo de problema no es construyendo nueva 
vivienda o guardando silencio sino cambiar la relacion entre trabajadores y 
rancheros cosa que podemos realizar juntos.

En los proximos dias le estare mandando copia de este articulo, por si es que 
aun no lo ha visto.  Espero tenga usted el tiempo para leerlo. 

Anticipando una respuesta de su parte y deseando ver nuevos horizontes para 
la erradicacion de este problema, le doy las mas sinceras gracias.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
The schools of Palm Beach County need as much money as they can in order to run the magnet programs, seven day class periods and sports.  These important factors including others which I did not mention are very important towards the learning process of my children and all the other students of Palm Beach County public schools.  If the budgets for the Magnet Programs and sports were to be cut, I would have no idea what my children would do there on after.  Without sufficient funds my children will not be able to learn properly because there will not be proper programs and extra-curricular activities in which they can participate in.  I being a parent speak for myself and all the other concerned parents when I say we do not this type of budget cuts.  A revised budget cut would need to be implemented in order to incorporate the wants and necessities of the Palm Beach County students and parents.

Subject:	Budget Cuts

Dear Mr. Bush,
    My name is Seth Merle and I am a very concerned student. As junior at Spanish River Community High School I feel threatened by the proposed budget cuts to my schools funding. I have recently been informed that I may not have an Auto-mechanics class offered at my school next year and this deeply saddens me. Over the last year I have come to enjoy this class very much and plan on taking the highest levels of it possible while I am still in school. Not having this class would make school not worth coming to for me because it does make my day so wonderful. Also, if funding for school sports were cut off there would be no more co-ed cheerleading, a sport that I was introduced to earlier in the year and haven't been able to pull myself away from yet. Because of this sport it has shown me something I never knew I had inside, a drive to be a male cheerleader. Not only do I participate on the school squad but I have gone so far as to join an all-star team so that I can have the extra practice to be great at what I do. In light of many cheerleading scholarships available I have kept my grades up and my interest high, in coming to school everyday, so that I will be eligible for one or more of these scholarships.
                                                                                                                                A deeply saddened student,

These bills establish a framework of forcing collaboration between the Board of Dentistry and the Department of Health with the respect to the hiring of administrative staff, allocating resources, determining the legal sufficiency of complaints and establishing performance parameters of disciplinary prosecutors.
 
It is in the best interest of the public that these bills pass forward . These will allow the Board of Dentistry to make key decisions which effect the way they can regulate the profession and protect the public.

Dear Governor Jeb Bush,

            In my opinion budget cuts are ridiculous! If budget cuts are made 
for after school programs dozens of children will be forced to roam the 
streets while thier parents are at work. Children deserve to be in a safe 
area and recieve help with their homework when they need it. Another 
disturbing budget cut are salaries. If teachers salaries are cut, there will 
be a shortage in teachers. This will ultimitely lead to larger classroom 
populations, which is the oppisite of what classrooms should be like. 
Teachers are the back- bone to education and without them the future 
generation of children will not succeed in this world. Mr. Bush I honestly 
hope that budget cuts are not made and that the future generation of children 
will get the education and treatment they deserve.

Dear Governor Bush:

 

Please reject the “Florida Civil Rights Act” which will mandate taxpayer-funded abortions in our state.  As a pro-life voter, I do not want my hard-earned tax dollars to be used for the taking of innocent human life.  The government should not be in the business of subsidizing abortions. Please oppose and promise to veto the Florida Civil Rights Act!  

Very truly yours,

RE: TOM BARBER 

Dear Governor Bush: :

I wanted to tell you about Tom Barber, a bright, capable attorney who is seeking an appointment to the Hillsborough County Court.  I know Tom and his wife Diane personally.  I represented them when they sold their home in Pinellas County and moved to Tampa and prior to their move we were all members of the Feather Sound Community Church. 

I am no big fan of lawyers, but I do not have any reservations expressing my strong support for Tom.  He has the kind of integrity, professionalism and knowledge of the law that all lawyers and judges should have.  He is a graduate of an Ivy League law school (Penn) and currently a partner with one of Florida's largest and most prestigious private law firms (Carlton Fields) where he handles litigation on behalf of businesses.  He is dedicated to public service.  After five years at Carlton Fields he resigned to serve as a criminal prosecutor for nearly three years.  When his first child was born he returned to his law firm for financial reasons.  He now wants to return to public service.

 I know for a fact that Tom shares your belief that judges should confine their work to interpreting the law and not engage in legislating from the bench.  As a State Committeewoman, I am completely comfortable that he shares your judicial philosophy and will always do the right thing. 

I understand that the unusually high turnover of judges in Hillsborough County in the past couple of years has caused you to make a high number of judicial appointments there in your first term.  As a result, I have been told that you will probably not be able to make many additional appointments there in the future.  For this reason, I hope you will use this particular appointment as an opportunity to make a long term impact.  

Appointing a highly qualified, experienced, younger person who shares your judicial philosophy gives you an opportunity to shape our state judiciary for the future in a way that will avoid the kinds of problems we have had in the past with that particular branch of government.  As I said above, I hope you will use this particular appointment as an opportunity to make a long term impact.  If I can answer any questions about Tom please let me know.  

Thank you,

Dear Governor Bush:

Please consider our invitation to speak at the Saturday, July 5th, 2003, Brevard County, STAND (Students Taking A New Direction) Rally.   This will be a interdenominational Brevard county-wide event.  We're expecting between 1,500 and 3,000 students attend and participate in an afternoon of great music, speakers, food, extreme sports and a message of faith interwoven with the abstinence message.  This event is open to all students and there is no admittance charge.  The event will begin at 5:00 pm and end at 10:00 pm.  

From the very beginning we have worked successfully to build a broad-base of support across all denominational lines, as well as parachurch and civic groups.  Our big night in Orlando, February 2002, saw over 13,500 students come to the T.D. Waterhouse Centre in Orlando.  What an awesome time to see that many students come to hear great music and a message about God's love and abstinence.   STAND has been blessed to receive the personal endorsement and support of Bishop Norbert Dorsey of the Orlando Catholic Diocese and Deborah Shearer of the Orlando Diocese Respect Life office; Doctor Bill Bright, Founder and Chairman of Campus Crusade for Christ; and the Florida Baptist Convention.  

On behalf of Terry Kemple, our Executive Director and the board of directors of STAND, we thank you for taking the time from your hectic schedule to consider this request.   In the event you are unable to attend, we would welcome Central Florida's own, Lt Gov Toni Jennings to attend in your stead.   My daytime telephone number is 321-494-8075, cell @ 321-258-1991 or email.  

STAND is a Florida not-for-profit, IRS 501(c)(3) recognized Corporation.

Subject:	FW: Budget Update:  Negotiations Halted, Expect a Special Session

To keep you appraised with respect to the current budget negotiations.... 

Late yesterday afternoon, President King announced that budget negotiations 
had stopped and the legislature would likely return in order to work out 
the budget within a Special Session.  President King, quoting lyrics 
from a Kenny Rogers song "The Gambler," said, "You got to know when to 
hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, and know when to walk away." 

Insisting the need to stand by principles, King said that the Senate 
would be required to make excessive compromises in order to agree with 
the House position.  King also noted that many members and staff were 
exhausted and should return afresh to work out the budget stalemate.  In 
the meantime, King hopes that other important legislative issues receive 
much needed attention through the remainder of regular session. 

Today was the deadline for both chambers to exit conference in time for 
the 72 hour "cooling off" period to pass before the budget could be 
adopted before the scheduled Sine Die.

I am intelligent, hardworking and legally versed. Most
victims are old, senile and unable to express the

The situation is heinous and I'd like to make a

Subject:	Dog Murderer GEORGE DORSETT, still hurting our community.

After reading the story in the Orlando Sentinel today, and speaking with Valerie Edgington at length, maybe now you will fully understand why I cannot allow Dog murderer Dorsett to have any further opportunity to ruin my chances of bringing a better future to my community.
 
This knuckle dragging monster has protected child molesters and horse killing county staff of Orange county but refuses to offer any compassion to our residents or local elected community leaders.
 
Clearly, this person adversely reflects on your administration and should be locked away as he has the poor dogs that serve as Valerie's companions and extended family.
 
My constituents in Bithlo feel that if this person had never become involved in our ongoing battle for community control of community property a better outcome would have been achieved by now. It is for this reason that I have advised that I can no longer be expected to have anything to do with this non-resident oligarch.
 
If you have any compassion for the less fortunate you would recuse him from any further involvement in my efforts to bring the problems of the past to a conclusion in the future.
Don't be fooled by his claim that he is not "blood thirsty" when he has already made a motion to murder the remainder of Valerie's dogs. I am confident that he is thrilled over his success in killing several already.
 
Maybe now you will also understand why the cry from Bithlo remains,"LEAVE US ALONE!"

FBI, police search teachers union

By Associated Press,

published April 30, 2003

       
MIAMI - A public corruption task force searched the offices of Miami-Dade County's teachers union Tuesday, scouring computers and documents and leaving with boxes of records. 

FBI agents and Miami-Dade police officers went to the United Teachers of Dade offices to serve a sealed search warrant Tuesday morning and remained there into the afternoon, FBI spokeswoman Judy Orihuela said.

No one was arrested in the search, Orihuela said. The FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office would not comment further.

Annette Katz, the union's communications director, said the UTD was cooperating. "We were just as surprised as anyone" by the search, Katz said.

The union, led by president Pat Tornillo since the early 1970s, represents teachers in the nation's fourth-largest school district.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I wanted to take a moment and remind you that it was exactly one year ago today that I met you for the "End Breast Cancer" specialty plate bill signing.  A day that I will never forget and always cherish!  I know there are issues on the floor with specialty plates, but there are some really good causes with some.  Personally I think the specialty plate program can use improvement in promotions so both the State and individual organization's make more money!  This past year while working on the breast cancer tag it is clear to me that things can be changed for the better.
 
I am also ecstatic to learn that the "Stop Heart Disease" license plate has passed yesterday.  As you know this is my project as well.  I hope to see you soon in a future bill signing. We plan on doing alot to promote this license plate.  The Florida Heart Research Foundation will be offering free heart screenings in the future to our tax collector offices, etc.  I am very excited to be a part of this project as well.
 
Just wanted to share the news and tell you I can't believe a year has passed since bill signing as it seems like it was yesterday!
 
Thank you Governor Bush!  Hope all is well with you and your family.

Subject:	you won't believe this!!

Hello Governor Bush,
My name is Amy McClellan and I am State Committee Woman in Hardee County.  I also have the honor of being an alternative education teacher in Hardee County.  This past Fall I decided that after  almost 7 years of teaching secondary alternative education, I would like to teach elementary school.  The requirement of adding Elementary Education to my certification is as simple as taking the Subject area exam and passing it.  I took the Elementary grades 1-6 examination in October, passed it, and in December, as soon as I received my score, I applied with the DOE to add it on.  My plan was to have my certification in place by the end of this school year in order to make the transition this upcoming Fall.  After 4 ½ months of waiting, April 25th I received notification that my application was denied because I TOOK THE WRONG TEST!!!  I couldn't believe it.  I called DOE and they informed me that I should have taken the k-5 examination.  I have researched the rule and found...
Rule 6A-4.0151.fac
Beginning July 1, 2002, an individual applying for initial certification in Elementary (grades k-5) may present a passing score oneither the Elementary Education (grades 1-6 or grades k-5) subject area examination.  This transition plan to satisfy the subject area ttest requirement for the Professional Certificate is available only through June30,2004.  Effective July 1, 2004, certification in Elementary Education (grades k-5) requires a passing score on the Elementary Education (grades k-5) subject area examination for a Professional Certificate.

Apparently, this rule was either repealed, revised, or rewritten sometime after I took the examination.  The young lady who answered the phone at DOE responded with, "it is not our job to tell you which test to take."  Essentially, I took a test that is worthless.  Time is of the essence.  Positions are being filled for the fall and due to poor communication on the part of the DOE, I am not certified in Elementary education.  

I know that I am not the only person in this state who is in this position.  I sat in a testing room with at least 200 people who were taking the same examination that I was on that day.  That was only one testing site.  Please intervene on the part of these qualified teachers who simply want to be allowed to teach.  A temporary certification at least should be granted to allow these people to be hired as certified in their subject area.  
Sincerely,
Amy McClellan

Subject: ICCF and the Secretariat
Hi:  Know you are busy but here is an idea for gaining the Secretariat.
 
1.       Lula Redriques was appointed as the Director of the International Visitor Program when it was USIA.  She dismantled the Port of Entry in Miami for South America.  It would be very advantageous to reinstate this Port of Entry with a U.S. State Department Office. 
1.       You have Charles Moore of Florida as the Director of the IV Program who is from Tampa. 
2.       Some thing has to be done to give the Miami Council a presence, they need a donated office.  Lula caused this mess and the office is in a home.  The Miami Council could help, but they need an office. 
3.       The Florida Department of International Affairs is a member of the National Council of International Visitors.  You are the only State.  Every Government Official in South America knows the IV Program and many ministers have been through the program.  Ask for an updated list of all leaders and ministers who are in office now who can vote on the Secretariat.  Than use this list as a relationship builder.  NCIV and the Resource’s Office of the IV Program at State should be able to give you this list.   Make sure all Consulates in Miami, especially from South American and the Caribbean know that Florida is a member and supporter of the IV Program of the U.S. Department of State. 
 
To give you an example:  There was a reception with an African Ambassador and other African Consuls.  They saw my pin and immediately opened conversations on who had been in the program or who they knew who had been in the program.  This was an opening in conversation and exchange.  
 
These are my ideas to help.  God Bless Patricia

Subject:	school proposal

I am sure you receive many e-mails similar to this.  However, I still feel it is important to write to you.  We have a 5-year old daughter who will be starting Kindergarten in the fall.  We are very excited for her.  She is in a wonderful pre-school program at the present time and loves "school."  My husband and I are supporters of the public school system.  Many friends of ours send their kids to various private schools.  We researched the public school system, and decided it would be the best option for our daughter and our family.  

I was informed today of the proposed budget cuts.  I am very confused.  One day I am voting whether or not we should have public pre-school and the next day 1/2 day kindergarten is on the agenda.  What will these children gain from 1/2 day kindergarten?  What will they lose?   I also wanted you to know that it was the Assistant Principal at our zoned elementary school who was so encouraging to us about the public school system.  Could a successful corporation run without its assistant?

Extra curricular activities are so important for our youth to get a well-rounded education.  They are our future.  

I am afraid that we are looking to cut costs in the wrong places.  Coming from a person who is excited to get involved with the public school system, I am now questioning my decision.  I am now asking myself if I am doing the best thing for my child.  We have the ability to increase the level of education in the state of Florida.  If any of these proposed cuts pass, I am afraid we will fall to the bottom.  

I am aware of one community along 441 reciveing $500,000 for a new entrance because the county widened US441.  Our priorities are in the wrong places.

Thank you for taking the time to read this e-mail.  

Sincerely, 

Carolyn Rose

Thank you so much for the information you sent regarding St. James Bay Golf

several changes HAVE been made there since Michael Hogan visited and that
her property was not impacted during the last rainfall we had....although
that occurred when the lake had NOT been refilled. However, she feels
certain that the mechanical structures that have been put in, together with
the high berm that was installed, will most likely take care of the problem
even when the lake IS refilled.

Once again, thank you for your response. It warms the cockles of my heart to

After teaching string orchestra class at Belvedere Elementary in West Palm Beach yesterday, I felt I needed to email you again.  Regardless of the reduced pay, compared to Wisconsin, I was attracted to Florida because of the weather, and how you, Jeb Bush, have run the educational programs.  I have been quite impressed with the progress, the FCATs, and how schools are more accountable for what they teach.  Recently, there has been talk of budget cuts, and this will greatly effect the magnet art schools.  I teach private cello and violin lessons and help many students prepare for audtions to make it into the art schools.  Without this opportunity, students would only have the Florida Youth Orchestra, which although wonderful, charges a tuition fee.  Strings students I have taught are always the high achievers--the students who go on to study medicine, science, engineering, and my first student is now a heart doctor at the Mayo clinic!  A look at the results from the magnet schools speak for themselves--many of the area art schools are your "A" schools.  There is much research to back this up:  check out the menc website!

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I have been involved in the education community in Marion County for twenty years as a parent, a teacher and as a school based administrator.  I would like to encourage you to appoint Mr. James Yancey as superintendent of Marion County schools for the remainder of Jim Warford's term.  Mr. Yancey will be able to carry out the many innovative ideas that have been initiated under the leadership of Mr. Warford.  I believe that Mr. Yancey has been an integral part of all that Mr. Warford has been able to accomplish in Marion County and would be the logical replacement to finish out this term.   I could go on to elaborate on the many qualities Mr. Yancey possesses which would make him the best person for this position, but I am confident you have been adequately informed of these qualities by Mr. Warford and others.  Please consider appointing James Yancey superintendent of schools in order to ensure Marion County has the continuity of leadership necessary to continue the implementation the CIM program as well as other initiatives started with Mr. Warford.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
    I would like to congratulate you on your appointment of Jim Warford as Florida's new Chancellor of Education K-12.   It is wonderful that he will be able to share not only his vision with the entire state, but more importantly, he will share his methods of converting vision to reality.  I believe in the Continuous Improvement Model.  The focus on the essential curriculum, the frequent assessments, and the early interventions will help assure that no child is left behind.  
    As your appointment committee is set to meet, I would like to submit my recommendation for Marion County's replacement superintendent.  I strongly support Jim Yancey, our deputy superintendent.  Mr. Yancey has been a guiding force through not only the implementation of the Continuous Improvement Model, but also through the implementation of the many programs and changes of this administration.  I believe his appointment would make Mr. Warford's move a more seamless transition.  
    Again, as a citizen of Florida, I applaud your appointment of Mr. Warford.  As a citizen of Marion County, I will miss him.  I do believe the appointment of Mr. Jim Yancey would keep our vision alive.

Dear Governor Bush,
 Yesterday I was pleased to learn that the Baker Act Reform bill (Senate Bill #2748) had
passed through several committees.Today I was told that it is tied up in Rules and is in
jeopardy of not being heard on the Senate floor at all.
 The passing of this bill is such a needed component to help fill a crack in the mental
health system where otherwise our mentally ill loved ones can fall through. I know that
Jerissa would most likely not be alive today if she were not under court order and without
your compassionate intervention so that she could be in treatment.
 I do not fully understand how the legislative sessions work, but if you are in agreement
with the value and importance of this bill being heard, is there anything that can be done
to assure that somehow it has a chance to be heard?
                                                                   Kind regards,

 I know how very busy your schedule must be and it may be a lot to ask of you, but I was

Dear Governor Bush:

       This letter is written on behalf of Judge Mary Rudd Robinson who is an applicant for a Broward County Circuit Court Judgeship.  Judge Robinson is a highly respected member of the county court bench.  Her level of intelligence and integrity are unmatched.  Judge Robinson's track record on the county court bench has revealed a strict,  but fair judge,  who is zealously loyal to the fair administration of justice.
       Judge Robinson's courtroom is a model of professionalism in which only the highest levels of ethics and practice are accepted.  Fortunately one does not have to speculate about Judge Robinson's likelihood for success as a circuit court judge since the since her success on the county court reveals all of the traits of an outstanding jurist.
       Whether it be toughness in dealing with the criminal element or compassion for the victims of crime Judge Robinson could not be ranked as anyone other than the most qualified for the Circuit Court in Broward County.

Hello Gov. Jeb.
I have a lot of folks in Hillsborough County who are complaing to me
about access to Spanish language classes for foster parents. 
Since you are Florida's Hispanic Affairs Office can you help?
thanks

Hon. Jeb Bush

I delayed geeting back to you in order to give the Organization responsible time to work the problem out.  That was in January.   They have not, and 8 Hispanic Women who are willing to become foster parents have asked me to contact you for assistance.

They are:
 
Matilda Perez       813- 247-5892
Oldami Bravo        626-3841
Juana Masot         241-0250
Maria Reyes          908-2410
Josefa Bernardo    226-0896
Irma Franco           882-8023
Magali Oro             985-8120
Roxana Garcia       786-4439

They have asked for the classes in Spanish and they were told yes but it has failed to materialize.  They tell me when they call the agency in charge they make excuses and now don't even answer their calls.

The agency is FHAN
Florida Home & Adoption Network

Your assistance is greatly appreciated.

Subject:	STOP THE BUDGET CUTS!!!!!

Dear Mr. Bush,

   I know that you are very busy and being bombarded
with calls, emails, and faxes. But as I'm sure you
have learned, this subject matter will affect a lot of
us. I am a graduating high school senior, and even
though I will be leaving the Palm Beach County public
school, Spanish River , my mother Annie Amerson is a
second grade gifted teacher at Del Prado Elementary.
Our standard of living isn't as high as most families
here in Boca Raton, and I know what it feels like to
not have everything that my peers have. But to cut the
budget and allow it to affect the salaries of the
teachers (which are very low to begin with) is, in my
opinion, absurd. Now it will be even more of a
struggle for my family and myself because I am trying
to further my education by going to college. And I am
an only child. It would be hard to imagine what my
life would be like if my parents had more children.
Currently, I am working full time as well as going to
high school to try and save all I can so I will not be
a burden on my parents in the future. Not to mention 
my families' health insurance may be affected as well.
I know that I am only one voice, but I am sure that
there are many others in the same situation. Thanks
for taking the time to read  this. I would appreciate
if you took this into consideration.
                Sincerly,
                     Bryee Amerson

Spam Sent by Fraud Is Made a Felony Under Virginia Law

By SAUL HANSELL



 I <http://graphics7.nytimes.com/images/dropcap/i.gif> n the toughest move to date against unsolicited commercial e-mail, Virginia enacted a law yesterday imposing harsh felony penalties for sending such messages to computer users through deceptive means.

The law would be enforced against those who use fraudulent practices to send bulk e-mail, commonly known as spam, to or from Virginia, a state that is headquarters for a number of major Internet providers, including the nation's largest, America Online. 

  <http://graphics7.nytimes.com/images/misc/spacer.gif> 	
Advertisement

  <http://graphics7.nytimes.com/images/misc/spacer.gif> 	

The new statute adds criminal penalties for fraudulent, high-volume spammers. It outlaws practices like forging the return address line of an e-mail message or hacking a computer to send spam surreptitiously. Those found guilty of sending more than 10,000 such deceptive e-mail messages in one day would be subject to a prison term of one to five years and forfeiture of profits and assets connected with these activities.

Public outrage at spam is causing states and Congress to start looking at stronger measures against it. The Internet industry estimates that spam represents nearly half of all e-mail sent. And a new report by the Federal Trade Commission yesterday found that two-thirds of spam is sent with either false return addresses or a misleading subject line.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
A proposal (H 463) by Representative Bean is working its way through the House to separate the public and private school playoffs in the FHSAA.  This is another attempt by public schools to monopolize high school sports.  One could call it the North Florida Christian School or Bolles amendment since the excellence of our programs and a few others is driving the issue.  To me, it is the same philosophy as that of outcome based education which is little more than dumbing down the standard.

Good Morning,

I heard a few days ago about the resignation of a FAMU board member and have a recommendation to be considered for the vacant position.

Dr. Faye Gary Harris will be retiring from the University of Florida in June and, in my opinion, would be an asset to the Board.  Dr. Harris is a FAMU graduate and a former Miss FAMU.  She is very well known within her discipline (nursing) and in broader education circles.  She is a strong supporter of excellence and accountability and clearly understands the relationship and need for both.  Dr. Harris is also involved in international education.  She will bring much needed knowledge and skills to the Board.  She is intelligent and  easy to work with.  She has a track record of working hard and making good decisions. She also supports and understands the need for the new accountability measures being required of education and educators in Florida. 

Dr. Harris submitted all the appropriate paperwork to your Appointment Office in December when the last round of new board members were being considered.  I think she would make a tremendous contribution to the Board and the University.

Please let me know if you need additional information from me.

Hope you have a great day.

Dear Governor:
The federal judicial nominating committee has submitted to the president  five candidates for the North Florida Federal District Judge vacancy in Panama City.   Although this appointment will be made by your brother, it occurred to me he may seek your counsel in making the selection.  
 
Dick Smoak is a lawyers lawyer.  He is a graduate of West Point and served in Viet Nam as a special forces officer leading insurgent tribesman against the enemy.   He served with distinction, was promoted to Captain, and thereafter reassigned to rebuild a decimated unit of the 101st Airborne.  After his military service he graduated from law school and chose to practice in Panama City.   Prior to my appointment to the judiciary Dick was one of my law partners.  He was an excellent trial attorney.  His ethics and character are above reproach.  Dick is admired by judges and attorneys as a role model for aspiring trial attorneys.    He enjoys an "A. V." rating,  the highest category for skill and ethics, in the Martindale-Hubbell legal directory.   The rating is based on the collective opinion of attorneys and judges in his geographical area.   The sampling is random and non political.  
 
Members of the federal nominating committee are not permitted to make contacts in behalf of any candidate, however, they are allowed to respond to inquiries.   Please contact nominating committee members Roberto Martinez, Richard McFarlain and William Harrison for their opinions of Dick's qualifications.  You may also wish to contact Circuit Judges Don Sirmons, Michael Overstreet and Dee Dee Costello in Panama City.   Like members the committee, they are not permitted to make contacts but may respond to inquiries.  Since I am now retired from the judiciary, there is no restriction against making recommendations. 
 
Dick will be traveling to Washington on Monday for an interview at the White House.     Your recommendation to the White House would be invaluable and greatly appreciated.   One last thing: Charlie Hilton and Earl Durden also support Dick's nomination.   
 
Thank you for considering these remarks.

Dear Carolyn: 


I am delighted that you are now serving on the Florida Board of Governors.  Perhaps you can be 
helpful in enabling the Board of Governors to function as was intended by the constitutional 
amendment. 


Obviously, the Governor and Jim Horne are flaunting the will of the people with regard to 
Amendment 11.  I am attaching three recent editorials which emphasize this point. 


My best to Fred and the boys, 


E. T. 
  


EDITORIAL 
TAMPA TRIBUNE 


Apr 5, 2003 


This Is No Way To Choose A University System Chancellor 


Debra Austin, now the assistant vice president for academic affairs at Florida State University, may make a fine 
chancellor of the university system. 


But her appointment is tainted, if not illegitimate. 


The issue is not the qualifications or character of this veteran educator, but her selection, which flouted the 
state constitution and the will of the people. 


Shamefully at fault is Education Commissioner Jim Horne, who named Austin chancellor even though Florida voters 
last fall overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment restoring a governing body for the university 
system. Gov. Jeb Bush also is culpable. Both have ignored the voters' will. 


The Board of Governors, which the constitutional amendment charged with overseeing the state university, should 
have appointed the chancellor. But Bush sabotaged the amendment by appointing to the board political allies who 
refuse to take control of the university system. His appointees include the woman who ran the campaign against 
the university amendment. 


So Horne was free to name a chancellor - and defy the constitution. 


It is a disgraceful affair but one that is all too typical of the Bush administration's high-handed treatment of the 
state university system. 


The governor spearheaded the effort to eliminate the state Board of Regents, the 14-member, governor-appointed 
body that had coordinated higher education policies. 


Governor-appointed local boards of trustees were given jurisdiction over each university. The state Board of 
Education was given ultimate oversight. The seven-member, governor-appointed panel was charged with 
overseeing all public schools, community colleges and universities - an unwieldy arrangement unlike any education 
system in the nation. 


There was no secret about the reason behind the ambush of the regents, which had angered Tallahassee 
politicians by occasionally opposing their plans for their favorite universities. 


The new arrangement gave lawmakers license to dictate university policy and gave the governor loads of 
patronage power. 


Thus, Florida quickly gained a reputation for a politicized higher education system that repelled top scholars. 
Indeed, Horne had difficulty finding a top- flight chancellor candidate willing to take the job before he chose 
Austin, who is a former chief academic officer at Tallahassee Community College. 


State universities would have been rescued had the administration complied with Amendment 11. The measure, 
spearheaded by Sen. Bob Graham, called for the restoration of a state university oversight board and 13-member 
boards of trustees at each university to monitor most local decisions, including the approval of tuition fees and 
keeping an eye on the spending of grant money. The 17-member Board of Governors was to provide overall 
guidance, making sure there was no wasteful duplication. 


That kind of objective leadership is needed now more than ever, as the state fiscal crisis is forcing massive 
budget cuts and tuition increases. The popular and necessary prepaid tuition program, which makes a college 
education affordable for many struggling families, is in jeopardy. But Bush's impotent Board of Governors offers no 
guidance. 


Bush and Horne ignore the constitutional mandate and continue to do as they please. Horne handpicks a 
chancellor yet boasts about the state's innovative higher education system. In truth, the state university system 
is in shambles, its reputation deservedly in decline. And its future looks very bleak because of an administration 
that refuses to acknowledge its university system blunders or heed the direction of the people. 
  
  


EDITORIAL 
PALM BEACH POST 


Abandoned universities 


Friday, April 11, 2003 


What does the Florida Board of Governors do? Aside from meeting once and rubber-stamping the appointment of Frank Brogan as president of Florida Atlantic University, pretty much nothing, as The Post reported. That wasn't the intent of voters, who in November overwhelmingly passed Amendment 11 to restore statewide oversight of Florida's public university system, but it is as Gov. Bush wants it. 


Voters wanted the new group not to replace the local boards of trustees that govern individual universities but to restore some functions of the former Board of Regents. The Board of Governors was supposed to minimize political meddling in the university system and keep schools from wasting money with duplicate programs. Gov. Bush and the Legislature meddled in 
2000 when they abolished the regents. Gov. Bush opposed Amendment 11.  So he appointed to the new 17-member board people who would fail to implement the amendment. One example is Carolyn Roberts, a former regent who led the effort to defeat it. 


Having ceded its authority to Secretary of Education Jim Horne, the Board of Governors apparently has no problem that it gets no briefings or documents on policy, or that Mr. Horne has provided no offices or staff. There was not a murmur last week when Mr. Horne usurped the board's authority to appoint the universities' new chancellor, naming Debra Austin, an assistant vice president for academic affairs at Florida State University. 


The governors also were silent last week when the University of Florida and FSU announced plans to separate from the other nine schools and negotiate their own contracts with the Legislature for state money. The every-school-for-itself climate that lawmakers created is the opposite of that in states with top-rated university systems. There's no clearer sign of the lack 
of a system than when the two heavyweight schools are able to pull apart and cut their own deals. 


If the governors won't exercise their constitutional authority, only a court challenge is likely to change that. The time for it probably would be after the legislative session, when the legal basis is clearer. Meanwhile, the universities face a collective budget cut of more than $100 million, proposed tuition increases threaten the popular prepaid tuition plan, and the Bright Futures scholarships need reform. So where is the Board of Governors? 
  
  


THE GAINESVILLE SUN 
Article published Apr 18, 2003 


The pretend board 


Florida voters weren't pretending last year when they approved creation of a state constitutional amendment to restore oversight and coordination to Florida's now disunited state universities. 


Essentially, voters were saying - and by a wide margin at that - that Gov. Jeb Bush and the Florida Legislature made a mistake when they abolished the old Board of Regents and broke the state universities up into a collection of rival educational city-states. 


But Gov. Bush seems genetically incapable of admitting to mistakes. 


His blueprint for higher education "reform" has been to vastly increase his own patronage power while setting university against university in wasteful and counterproductive fashion. 


Faced with the mandate to reinstate a system wide oversight board, Bush instead resorted to a "devious plan" - he simply appointed loyalists who have no intention of carrying out their constitutional duties and who can be counted upon to do nothing. 


Thus, the new Board of Governors is a pretend board. It didn't select Debra Austin to be the new university system chancellor - Education Commissioner Jim Horne did. 


It didn't sit down with university presidents and instruct them to stop their cut-throat, every-university-for-itself lobbying tactics. 


It may be that the Board of Governors will never function as it was intended to so long as Florida has a chief executive who is so contemptuous of the will of the voters. 


But at some point, the pretend board's refusal to fulfill its constitutional responsibilities is likely to be challenged in court. 


And it should, because Floridians weren't pretending when they said they wanted a united State University System.

Tom:

This follows my earlier e-mail and copy of my message to Carolyn
Roberts.  I continue to be very puzzled over why the Board of Governors
does not take steps to implement in good faith Amendment 11.  Apparently
you have delegated responsibilities to the Boards of Trustees in such a
way that I see very little function for the Board of Governors.

I am sure that you are aware of the manner in which the state press is
criticizing the Governor and education leaders for their failure to take
appropriate action on Amendment  11.

Moreover, I have seen no evidence that the Board of Governors is doing
anything in this legislative session to try to support the budget
requests of the universities.  This sort of inaction is very puzzling.

Also, I notice that the Chancellor was appointed by Jim Horne.  I fail
to see where he has any authority to appoint the Chancellor.  Certainly
this should be the responsibility of the Board of Governors.

In looking at the agenda for your April 30 meeting of the Board, I see
there is consideration of several academic programs, the adoption of
bond resolutions, etc.  What sort of staff does the Board of Governors
have to examine such issues before they are brought to the Board of
Governors for action?

This is all very puzzling, Tom.

Jeb

The House is talking about forming a study committee to look at the 2nd primary issue and report back at the 2004  Session.  We absolutely cannot wait that long and hope to provide error- free elections.  We would be finding out about the new schedule of elections at about this time next year and under the current proposal would have to start qualifying in a matter of days.  This is a presidential election we are talking about -- please, please see if you can knock some sense into the House leadership.  

Secondly,  if they dont' pass the HAVA implementation bill we stand to lose millions and millions of dollars in Florida to help us pay for needed changes and to reimburse the counties for the millions they spent buying new equipment.  

I know you are busy and the session is winding down but we desparately need your help.

Thanks so much.

To Governor Bush and the Florida State Legislators:

 

PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT MAKE ANY FURTHER CUTS TO OUR EDUCATIONAL BUDGET!

 

FLORIDA IS ALREADY 47TH IN THIS NATION IN SPENDING FOR OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM.  What a sad commentary for a state with so much wealth!

 

If children are our future, we need to educate them.  We already have too many people who are happy to vote for whatever sounds like a good idea, without bothering to learn the facts.

 

It is too easy to add constitutional amendments.  I can’t believe our State Constitution includes things like how pregnant pigs should be treated, and whether we should build a bullet train we cannot afford.  I think it should contain only import issues relevant to the governing of our state.

 

Items should not be placed on our ballots when we do not have a budget to provide for them, no matter how good an idea those things are.  Classroom size and providing free preschool education are prime examples, when our system is already so strapped for funds that most of our children are already receiving an inadequate education.

 

All three of my children have attended magnet schools in Palm Beach County.  Two have graduated and one is in high school.  Although having a child attend a magnet school away from your own neighborhood requires an extra commitment on the part of the student and the parents as well, it is completely worth it to have the students who are truly motivated and talented be able to excel in that type of environment.  When my middle child graduated in the Class of 2000 from her school, there were approximately $2.5 million dollars in scholarships handed out to a class of 239 students; scholarships from sources all over the country.  Many of these students did not have to rely on Bright Futures money, and were able to attend colleges outside the state, thus lessening the burden on our overcrowded university system.

 

I have long believed that too much responsibility has been removed from the schools themselves.  The principal is told what to do by the local school board, which is told what to do by the Dept. of Education in Tallahassee.  And how much money is spent on paperwork, checking up on compliance, and making new rules and regulations which must then be enforced?

 

I have seen interiors of schools painted that did NOT need painting, because they are allowed to be painted every 7 years.  The only thing that particular allotment of money is allowed to be spent on is painting, so they will paint rather than give up the money.  They know that when they DO need painting, they will have to fight for money to do it.

 

I have seen the same thing with landscaping.  Perfectly good plants have been removed and replaced just because they want to use the money they have, and that’s all it can be used for.

 

If we hire good educators and good administrators, we should give them the freedom to make some of these decisions for themselves.  If budget cuts must be made, start at the top in Tallahassee.  If educators on the local level are doing a poor job, the administrators and school board members of that county should be able to find solutions.

 

We already advise friends with school-age children not to move to Florida because the education system is so poor.  If our jobs did not dictate our location, we would move out-of-state ourselves.

 

PLEASE do not allow this problem to become worse than it already is.  

 

Respectfully,

I recently discovered this news and felt that the Palm Beach County does
need the additional money for these important programs. I find it unfair
to those teachers who have to worry about the possibility of loosing
their jobs. School is important but without the intramural sports or the
magnet schools, how are the students suppose to get the fun or learning
they deserve. These programs are helpful in many ways. This could be
another reason to drive the students into the streets for the bad instead
of providing activities for them in school. So that is why I think the
budget should not be cut.

Dear Gov. Bush:  As long-time supporters of all the Bush family public servants,  both with our votes and our pocketbooks,  we urge you as strongly as possible to veto the pending legislation which would postpone cleaning up The Everglades as well as increase allowable levels of pollution.   Also, we must not lose the Federal funding to help with the process.  The Sugar lobby has gone too far even though we are personal friends of the Fanjul family.  This is the only specific request we have ever made to any our governmental representatives in Florida.

He has been very active in community, civic, educational and legal groups.  His integrity is beyond reproach.  He has served the citizens of Pinellas County well and deserves your thoughtful consideration for the Circuit Court position.  
As an appointee of yours to County Court and Circuit Court I know that Judge Mike Andrews has all of the qualities that you are  looking for in a Circuit Judge.

HI, Governor:  Maybe when they sell a speed boat the owner should have to buy a plastic Manatee to drop in the canal so we won't notice they are gone???

--------------------
Report: manatees facing bleak future 
--------------------

The Associated Press

April 30, 2003, 1:36 PM EDT

BRADENTON -- Manatees in Florida face a bleak future, if not outright extinction, unless regulators crack down on watercraft, according to a new federal report.

Already facing population losses due to slow reproductive rates, the marine mammals cannot sustain the increasing death toll exacted yearly by boats and personal watercraft in much of Florida, the report's author said.

"If boat mortality rates continue to increase at the rates observed since 1992, the situation in the Atlantic and Southwest regions is dire, with no chance of meeting recovery criteria within 100 years," said Michael Runge of the federal Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Maryland.

Regulators, wildlife activists and boating rights proponents have haggled over boosting protections for manatees, listed as endangered by both state and federal code.

The Patuxent report comes tacked on as an addendum to protection plans being hammered out by federal officials. Spurred by a lawsuit filed by manatee advocates, regulators plan to issue a new set of safeguards Monday.

Manatees continue to take large losses from collisions with boats and personal watercraft. Such incidents killed a record 95 manatees in Florida last year, following an average of 80 such deaths in the previous three years, state data show.

"If you want to save the manatee, you have got to bring that watercraft-related mortality under control," said Eric Glitzenstein, a Washington, D.C. attorney who led the legal action for manatee activists. "If not, it's a prescription for disaster."

Boating groups argue regulators would be better served to consider the effect of habitat loss and natural factors that kill manatees, like cold stress or sporadic episodes of red tide. Red tide is blamed for at least 60 manatee deaths off southwest Florida in the past two months.

"No matter what, though, they want to put all the manatee mortality on the backs of boaters," said John Kinney, vice president of Standing Watch, a boating advocacy group.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I know better than most how much the state support of the film industry meant to you.  It pains me to see it slip through our fingers now.  You recall I'm the Past State President  of the FMPTA and a former board member and officer of Film Florida and met with and supported you on your first & second  run for the mansion.
Losing the film office and not being creatively competitive with other states for incentives means the crux of the movie business in this state will be with Muvico and Regal and they're not doing that great.   
When I became state president FMPTA had 15 chapters and over 2000 members representing the 140,000 full and part time members of the industry.  Today we struggle with 4 or 5 chapters and less than 400 members statewide.  We've been around 30 years this year.  We formed the first state film office and helped form the second under your leadership.  It appears to be floating downstream on some refuse.  I've spent the last thirteen years looking to bring more production here and its such an uphill battle.
I have the deepest respect for you.  I know you fought for the original legislation. I don't have to sell you.  I'm begging you to sell the legislature.  I don't know what else to say.
I pray that you still have the energy and zeal for our cause.  Its silly to lose an industry so clean, profitable and positive to the image and betterment of our home state for such a small price tag.
Yours truly

My name is Joe Humphreys, I have been a resident and Florida tax payer since 1977 and I currently represent over 1000 Florida film technicians and their families as the Business Manager of IATSE Local 477.  With over 5000 members in all of our Locals in Florida, Florida is the third largest entertainment state in the country.  Next time you go to a movie sit and what the hundreds of names that roll through the credits at the end of the movie.  That's who we are - the real magicians of the entertainment industry!
 
Florida has been the home of film making since 1898 and in the early 1900's was the Film Capital of the World.  The shortsightedness of local politicians helped change that and you now have a chance to help return Florida to it's rightful place in the entertainment universe.  Florida desperately needs to add more high skilled and higher paying jobs and that is what our industry offers.  Our LOWEST paying jobs pay from $15 to $17 an hour.  The average worker on a TV show or motion picture earns $21 to $25 an hour and the more technical positions pay as much as $35 to $50 an hour.  On commercials our members average $40 to $50 and hour.  This is why some many other states and countries are offering incentives to lure these jobs.
 
Please restore the funding for the Florida Film Office.  I know from personal experience it is one of the most cost efficient in the country.  Florida is the ONLY state with a statewide film book funded SOLELY from advertising and subscriber fees and NOT tax dollars.  We are losing millions of dollars of business every year to Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa. New Mexico now has more work than they have crew for, Louisiana is now gaining from it's incentives passed last year, North Carolina's legislation went into effect in January and New York has now passed new legislation.
 
I have members who are filing bankruptcy and losing homes because they can't leave the state to work because of family commitments.  Members from Orlando, Tampa and Jacksonville have to leave home to work because of the lack of work there.  Many members are leaving Florida permanently including an Oscar nominated sound mixer from Orlando.  PLEASE pass SB 1756 un-amended and HB 1149 and find a few dollars to find this important legislation.  Florida's once shining entertainment star is starting to fade.

Good Evening. In looking at various websites tonight, I noticed that a 
Tallahasse Park has a website for its baseball teams.  However, the 
president of the park is an employee in your office and uses both her 
Governor's office email and phone number as contact information on this 
personal website. I thought this wasn't legal? If you want to see, the site 
is:  www.ourleaguesite.com/winthropparklml

The president's name is Sherry Clemons. I initially noticed at one of the 
games that a friend of mine's child played at the park that Ms. Clemons also 
has her office email and phone number posted on the park's bulletin board. 
If this employee has time for personal emails and telephone calls regarding 
baseball, maybe her position isn't that necessary during these tight budget 
times. Also makes me wonder what other personal business she does on state 
time and with state equipment.

I'm not trying to be a pain, but I thought you would want to know this 
rather than be embarrassed by it later.

state funding of abortion.  Do you not fear the wrath of God?  I voted for

officials are awaiting the states rules and funds on class size..  Parents 
want to know who their child's teacher will be .School officials will be 
hustling at the last minute to determine units .  The state has no idea the 
pressure that this creates when they give educators last minute rules and 
changes.  You all are destroying public education.  But from what I hear that 
is your plan.  I am a prolife voter first and education voter 2nd.  Right now

Subject: A suggestion for dealing with Judge Hoeveler et al...


Jeb:

I have already shared the following suggestion with David via a telephone
conversation I had with him a couple of hours ago...

In the past you have had a tendency to get the Officers of the House &
Senate to present controverial bills which you intend to sign to you RIGHT
AWAY so you can sign them quickly.  I expect this is intended to minimize
the noise that arises from a "veto campaign" launched by groups that oppose
the legislation.

Ordinary, that is probably a good strategy, and I know it has worked in the
past to achieve the result of quieting controversy.

However, in this instance, my sincere and heartfelt recommendation to you
is that you DON'T take that route; I think it will simply lead to GREATER
controversy.

Should you sign the bill prior to Judge Hoeveler's hearing on the bill
friday, it will be seen (rightly or wrongly), by many, and perhaps by the
Judge himself as an attempt to circumvent or trump authority of the Court.
It will probably be argued by some advocates as proof that the state is
flouting the court's authority, ect. 

My suggestion is that a better approach is to hold off on signing the bill
until after Hoeveler has his hearing and does whatever he is going to do.

If you go into the court saying that the bill has not been signed yet on
purpose, to allow the court the opportunity to examine it for any fatal
flaws that would conflict with the Amended Consent Decree and thus cause
the Court difficulty, I think you will be in a much better position. 
Further, if the court finds any flaw that is fixable, or there is a problem
in the eyes of the Justice Dept, EPA, Interior, ect. you can then simply
ask the House and Senate to recall it to implement the fix.

I know that in terms of the relationship of states and the federal
government, you would prefer that there was no federal court involvment at
all. However, we "are where we are", and my simple suggestion is that you
can avoid the chance of further aggrevating the court and the parties
before it by taking this type of stance that does not confront the court
with the suggestion that the state is trying to leverage it by rushing to
sign the bill before the hearing on Friday.

Governor....

I don't have a clue who this Peter England is, but Bob Dickinson passed this
on today. Al Cardenas and I had just met with them the other day regarding
the land we discussed previously. Evidently, they lose an additional $1.5
million in federal grants if they lose the $500K addressed in his e-mail.

I'm sorry to even bother you with this....but if you could either confirm
the info or provide me with an update, I'll just communicate it and handle
accordingly.

Katherine Morrisson got me the chapter from you for the tourism book
yesterday. It's exactly what they needed and your contribution is greatly
appreciated by all. Katherine was terrific to work with, by the way.

Thanks, too, for the invite to the fly-in the other day....I greatly enjoyed
it, but boy, that was a real eye-opener!

Hope all is well by you. Take care.

Ric

Bob-

We now know that the budget will not be decided this week because of the
impasse between the House and Senate. I learned yesterday however, that the
Governor is likely to veto the Camillus House appropriation even if it is
included in the Legislature's budget.

We need Ric Cooper to tell the Governor that if we do not get our $500,000
for the Camillus Life Center, that we will have to shut down our highly
successful substance abuse treatment program, since we will probably lose
our matching federal  funds for the program as well. In addition, the
Governor needs to let both the House and Senate know that he wants the
Camillus House $500,000 in the final budget. Thanks for your help.

Dear Gov Bush, 

Imagine 18,000 people filling the TD Waterhouse arena and they are not
there to watch a basketball game.  They are there to attend a one-day
seminar hosted by FamilyLife, a non-profit organization from Little Rock,
Arkansas called "Rekindling the Romance".  It will be held in Saturday,
16 August 2003.  And plans are in process now for that event, which is
only three months away.  I have been a FamilyLife volunteer here in
Jacksonville for seven years and I have seen the positive impact
FamilyLife can have on families, while our culture does not.  And that is
why I am involved with this and I probably will for a long time to come,
cause kids need a mom and dad in the same house.  


Sincerely,

The person who wrote me was an excellent teacher, left the profession to take care of her children, and now finds reentry into the profession impossible.  I was going to scrap the current certification system when I was Deputy Commissioner of Education but did not get to it before leaving.

Subject: Class Size Problem Solution


Dear Governor Jeb Bush,

I have an idea that might work to solve the class size problem faced by the 
State of Florida. It sounds simple, but may be complicated. The idea is this:

GO TO TWO SHIFTS PER DAY 
IN EACH CLASSROOM!

That way, we would get twice the productivity out of each square foot 
invested in school room construction. Not only that, we would double the 
utilization of each school bus and driver because they would make two 
roundtrips per day instead of just one roundtrip.

Also, each family would likely get to choose whether it wants all of its 
children to attend the morning or afternoon classes. They would make this 
choice so as to avoid sending their kids twice, etc.

Admittedly, this would mean doubling the productivity of each teacher. Each 
would have to teach the same material twice a day ... spelling, for example. 
But, that teacher would likely do a much better job teaching the same 
material twice a day instead of just once, especially in the afternoon. 

This would likely mean putting each teacher to work outside the lunchroom for 
about 9 hours each day instead of, let's say, 8 hours. That would justify 
giving two-session teachers a 10% raise in pay, perhaps.

There are surely complications to this simple idea of getting twice the 
productivity out of school buildings and busses, but they can be solved, I am 
sure, without having to add a single schoolroom in the State of Florida. 

I mentioned this idea to my first grade schoolteacher daughter in 
Blountstown, Florida and she thinks it could work out.

Hope you can use this idea or some variation of it. We, here in The Villages, 
greatly admire the fine jobs you and your brother, George are doing for our 
State and Nation.

Keep up the good work!

Sincerely,

Subject: Florida National Guard 




Dear Sir,
        I am writing to you today to inform you of a
gross incompetence and errors in broad policy
concerning my Florida National Guard unit which is
currently activated.  Our unit, 2/124 Infantry
Battalion (Orlando, FL), was deployed on 05 January
2003 to assist with the war effort against Iraq. 
Approximately 3/4 of the Battalion was deployed into
various parts of the theatre within 6 weeks.  The
remainder of us (about 130) were deemed unnecessary
for the mission and looked to be heading back home. 
However, our Battalion leadership refused the
deactivation and instead have engaged in a 2 month
circus act trying to find a "mission" for the
remaining.  Since the activation, our Battalion
leadership no longer falls under our states chain of
command which allows them much more power in the
decision making process concerning our fate. I am
afraid that without our states chain of command
involved we have fallen into somewhat of a
dictatorship.  The leadership has recently gone so far
as to fly our Battalion's Executive Officer to Ft.
Drum, New York to try and get us attached to the 10th
Mountain Division for their upcoming mission to
Afghanistan.  Is it just me sir, or does it seem just
a bit illogical or renegade if you would, to send 130
men from the Florida National Guard to join an active
duty division from upstate New York.  If that is not
convincing enough, let me give you some information
about the "mission".  Our leadership has informed us
that we will be going to Afghanistan to train their
military on proper Infantry tactics.  Sir, all of our
infantrymen are already deployed.  They want to send
cooks, medics, mechanics, and communication personnel
to train on Infantry tactics?  Furthermore, we have
already been on active duty for 4 months, and we came
here to support our troops and help in the defense of
this great country.  We are not active duty soldiers
for a living, we have jobs, families, and futures at
home that we desperately wish to return to.  Sir, it
is my opinion, and the opinion of many others in this
outfit, that we answered the call when our country
needed us.  However, myself and the others with me can
not justify this mission or the way we have been dealt
with to date.  I ask you as my Governor to please
assist us in getting back to our loved ones.


				Sincerely,

Do you think that was the intent? 

It seems like our school administrators might not really want input from the

between 2:30 and 4 in the afternoon, it seems like all we ever end up with
is teachers and PTA moms. I'm chairman of a subcommittee meeting this week

Sometimes I wish I was a stay-at-home mom again or at least in a career

education issues. There's an imbroglio at the moment over where to build a
new high school here and I guess I'm helping lobby a bit but only with
friends and behind the scenes. It would be fun just once to get up in a City
Commission meeting and lobby for something.
