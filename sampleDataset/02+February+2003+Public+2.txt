Dear Governor :

I wanted to THANK YOU for appointing me again to the Board of Trustees of
The Florida International University.
I feel very honored and humbled by your confidence in me.
I will work hard to make FIU better and better. As you know the Miami
community feels very proud of their public University and we are lucky to
have such a great President as Mitch Maidique.
Our new Chairman, Adolfo Henriques has just appointed me Chairman of the
Finace Committe!
We will need all your help in these dificult years.

Warmest regards.

Hola Jeb:
 
There is so much to do, and to learn.  I just came back from an OSEP focus group meeting on Transition and Post School outcome in DC.  There is so much to do, and so much to learn.  Unless we do something to improve results, the long term future doesn't look too good.  
 
I do not think that you know my older sister Diana. We are three, my brother Mario who teaches at FIU, my sister Diana (Soco), who lives in Cleveland, Ohio, and I.  I am very proud of both of them.  I want to share with you some e-mails that she forwarded to me about some awards that they are recommending her for the work that she does in Cleveland.  Her resume is attached FYI also. She is now facing the possibility that her husband of 40 years may have Alzheimer and Parkinson.  They are going throughout difficult times.  I wish that they could be in Florida.
 
Let me know when can we talk about CAFE.  What I keep saying to myself is that I need to keep the perspective clear and focused on those that need it the most.  It's not about me, nor any one individual, is about people with disabilities.  An adversarial position will not help anybody.  I continue to pray for understanding.

Computer system helping students improve writing skills

(Columbia) Jan. 31, 2003 - Darin Hornsby is a ninth grader who used to have problems writing, but now he's knocking out essays in a snap thanks to a new program called MyAccess, "It's improved me a lot. It gives a lot of information on how to make your writing better." 

Students log onto the MyAccess web site and begin writing their essay. The program looks at things like content, sentence construction, thought processing, grammar and spelling, then instantly highlights trouble spots and gives students an estimated grade. 

Students can then make revisions to improve their score. Scott Elliot, PhD, a human communication specialist at Vantage Learning, says, "We know that the more students write and the more feedback they receive, the more likely they are to improve their writing performance." 

The web site's grading system uses artificial intelligence. MyAccess "learned" to grade essays using a database of hundreds of different writing examples. Ninth grade English teacher Lilly Bozigian says, "If I were to do this at home, it would take me two to three days ... turnaround time for me to give them back their essay. This gives it back to them in two seconds."

In a few years the grading system will be used to score the essay portion of the writing portions of the SAT. Dr. Elliot says, "IntelliMetric can maintain a consistent and accurate scoring standard across people and across occasions." 

MyAccess has made a lasting impression on Darin and his parents, too, who've seen his progress go from good to even better, "They have papers saved from when I was young and how I used to write, and now how I am, and there's a big improvement."

Students can use MyAccess at school or at home. Schools pay for the licensed service. The automated grading system is also being expanded to improve student skills in science, social studies, math and foreign languages.

My previous message was sent too soon due to technical difficulties. As I was 
saying, the Writing Enhancement Program was instituted under the state law 
called The GORDON BILL sponsored by Sen Jack Gordon and it called for class 
size caps in high school English classes.  Teachers were not allowed to have 
more than four classes of NO MORE than 25 students each!  

Teachers were required to teach serious writing skills and there was a major 
piece of written material required of students every week. Teachers got an 
additional plan period to grade essays. Score went up dramatically in such a 
short period that state universities stopped complaining about the need for 
remedial classes for incoming freshmen.  This was, if you'll recall, a 
complaint made by state universities recently and was one justification for 
the creation of the FCAT.  

The folks in the seminar were just full of chargrin and irony when they 
remarked that as soon as it started to work......THE STATE KILLED IT.  WELL 
SIR...BRING IT BACK!!!

Sir, I have spoken to you of this in the past. A few days ago I had a 9th 
grade student come storming into my class complaining of the number of 
absences he had and that I must have "made a mistake" and that he "HAD TO GO 
TO COURT ON MONDAY and the JUDGE WAS GOING TO BE TOUGH!"  I hesitantly asked 
why he was in court and he almost proudly remarked:  "OH, robbery and 
ATTEMPTED MURDER."  He was on probation and a member of MY class!  I NEED TO 
KNOW THESE THINGS and I NEED TO HAVE LEGAL ACCESS TO THE PROBATION or PAROLE 
OFFICER.  I am not just a "civilian." As a Teacher I represent the county and 
state GOVERNMENT.  ALL TEACHERS SHOULD "BE IN THE LOOP" for this type of 
issue.

We are willing to sit down with the other stakeholders in this along with
Government and $ave the Manatee Club.  We believe however those attending
need to be able to make commitments at the meeting. We believe the following
needs to be achieved at a minim. I heard second hand however that Pat Rose
has said he is willing to sit down but not until the last stipulations in
the Friday settlement are done.  That we believe is unacceptable.
All Manatee litigation needs to stop at the federal level once and for all.
1.  USFW needs to back off on section seven consultation and biological
opinions on all water access permits throughout the state.
2.  Some how we need to fix the over-lay of the federal zones on top of FWCC
zones. No public buy-in at this point, no real federal law enforcement, net
is probably not good for manatee protection. WE might look at barging the
addition of some of the new zones incorporated onto FWCC zones if we get a
final end to the federal litigation.
3.  The feds need to determine that MMPA can not be applied or the state
needs to litigate it in federal court  not Judge Sullivan's however.

Thanks, Jeb, for the lines you wrote Lloyd (who is a great conservative breath of fresh air and one of the best Editorial writers in the state,  but, like others I know, is dead set against taxes....now or ever; feels that public school teachers are overpaid based on the hours of work vs. their annual income, and he thinks the "greens" are public enemy number one.  I wouldn't take anything for him because he is ferocious in his beliefs and in being direct, but sometimes his inflexibility can create concerns.  At any rate, thanks for sticking up for me.
 
Does this job of mine EVER get better?  I was floored, and so very disappointed,  with Johnny's press conference in Plant City.....I don't begrudge him the opportunity to have a conference but the stuff he was touting was so far from the actual facts that it was an obvious stand for publicity and it angered all of my leadership team.
 
I am STILL determined that I'm not going to lead the Senate into a protracted war.....with anyone.  We'll prepare ourselves for whatever tack you and Johnny wish to take.  We'll be ready to have some revenue enhancers poised for passage and they will be well fleshed out if anyone decided they wanted some; but, we'll also be ready to disclaim the budget we ultimately are forced to pass as not being what we'd have liked to do, but what we felt we had to do since we were "at the dance without a partner".  Let the people of the state (and history) determine what is the right road to have been followed.  We're trying to evaluate your budget and see if there are glaring deficiencies.....but even if we try to "correct" them, we're doing not much more than robbing Peter to pay Paul. (Even if we arrange the seats, many of us still feel we're on the Titanic in regard to saving bucks now and reaping the Holocaust later as a result.)
 
  I was surprised you all were able to produce a balanced budget....even one that did asunder some needed programs or funding, but you did it, and people could argue that it is the right course of action for the state at this time.  I'm hoping that we'd see some wisdom in some form of enhancement before the session is over....because we damned sure will need a bunch next session if we don't, but I'm not interested in butting heads indefinitely just to prove who is the most "right".  The state needs and deserves some statesmanship from us.  I know how to fight....hell, I've had to do that most of my professional career.....but I can't see where any of us are a benefit to our constituencies if all we do is attack each other and denounce each other's insight and philosophy.  Ultimately, no one can make a move until we all agree.  I've been in too many "2 against 1" battles not to understand the down-side of such a position.  The Senate will continue to do what we think is financially, morally and compassionately correct knowing that, at some point, if neither you or Byrd wishes to adopt any of the plans we have available, we'll comply with the direction you all take.
 
I look forward to seeing you soon.  Hope all is well with you.  I've been working on the Revision 7 Article 5 stuff and boy, that can be scary too if you've already stripped the counties of money this year in this budget.  I had hoped that we could recoup the state cost by taking back some of the county money we spend in other areas.  There isn't going to be too much available now.
 
Lots and lots of "unsolved opportunities!!"  Hey, if it were easy just about anyone could do our jobs!

Mr. Maloy is an embarrassment to everyone in Leon County and should have

Subject: Nihipali Children in Fort Myers Florida



Sir,

I understand you have assigned someone to look into the matter involving the Nihipali children, in Fort Myers, Fl. The children are currently in DCF custody at a foster home, but may soon be sent to the biological father in Hawaii, as per a court order by Judge Isaac Anderson.  I am the great aunt to the children on the maternal side, and was the family placement for the children from September 2001 until December 2002.  The entire time I had the babies it was the assumption of all parties, (including DCF and the Guardian Ad Litem), that the father would not be an issue when it came time to place the children in a stable home environment. This assumption of all parties was because of the father's criminal history, pattern of abusive behavior toward family members, drug and alcohol abuse, lack of continued employment, he doesn't read or write, he's on welfare, and testimony of a 14 yr old stepdaughter, who stated she and her other sister were given drugs and alcohol by the father while in the home with him. (At the time they were 11 and 12 yrs old)! After hearing that statement in October, the Judge stated he would not place the children in such an environment, yet in January he ruled the children should be with the father. (I firmly believe the Judge did not remember and associate the 14yr old he'd  talked to in October to the case in January. (The children have different last names than their older sister). Since the October hearing the only change is that the children have been moved to a VERY LOVING long term home, and Mr. Nihipali has tested positive for THC on both UAs he's been given. I am devastated at what is happening here with these children. Mr Nihipali has been arrested 22 times, and has been the suspect in more cases. His daughter was taken from the home in 1997 due to drugs and alcohol. Yet Hawaii DCF say be completed a "drug class" so he is okay now. I beg to differ. He supplied drugs to young kids in 2000 and 2001, and is still testing positive.  Mr Nihipali is obviously scamming the system in Hawaii, (as he has done before).  My question is WHY does Florida have to accept such a home study. Don't we have higher standards than that?  The 2 14yr olds are now extremely disturbed children. One only reads at a 3rd or 4th grade level and has lots of problems in school, and the other one is a 14yr old drug addict who is currently in the custody of DJJ. (This really makes me sick because she was always an A student in all honors classes, and has so much potential). I know all of the facts about this case, and would be glad to answer and questions. There are so many people that are "up in arms" about this situation. We just don't know what else to do. NO ONE thinks these children should be placed in that environment, yet it appears time is slipping away and nothing is getting done about it.  I will be happy to answer any questions or concerns. My home number is (239) 283-7663, and my work number is (239) 477-1217. PLEASE HELP!!!!  Thank you for your time, and keep up the good work!!     

P.S. Kim and Kenny Dobson, the current foster parents, are great. The kids love them and the love is returned. They are so happy. I've know the Dobson's since they were teenagers. I would never have turned the children over to anyone else. Even so, we took several months to transition the children, so the final move was not at all traumatic for them. We love those children and have always kept their best interest in the forefront!!.

Subject: Scholarships for Low-Income Children


Governor,

I am only writing you this note because I think it is important that you hear both sides of the issue between John Kirtley and me over what changes in the tax credited scholarships program are most important to seek at this time. Based on my regular discussions with key representatives of Florida's accredited private schools, I believe that they have the same priorities. They are:

*    raise the over all cap on the corporate contributions
*    permit some eligible low-income students who are already in private schools to receive scholarships
*    require the SFOs to direct at least 98% (not the current 100%) of the corporate contributions toward scholarships

I can offer strong arguments for each of these and will do so if you wish. I do not favor what John Kirtley most wants - raising the maximum dollar amount of the scholarships from $3500 to $5000 at this time. John maintains that there is an urgent need to create more schools (or places) now and that that can only happen if the scholarship amount is high enough to cover the debt service for schools that take up loans for initial construction or expansion. I disagree and I know that the key representatives of Florida's accredited private schools also have concerns. Here are some key reasons for not raising the maximum scholarship amount at this time:

*    There is no need to raise the cap. With the scholarships capped at $3500, over 15,000 low-income students were readily    enrolled. Their scholarships averaged $3350. The average tuition at the FAANS schools is approximately $3600.

*    Raising the scholarship amount is not necessary for the independent sector to create new schools or new places in existing schools. Over the six years prior to the onset of this program the number of Florida private schools grew by over 400 and the number of students attending them grew by almost 100,000. The 15,000 students who took up scholarships this year were readily admitted to over 900 different schools! More are sure to join in this year. Those schools are where the children are – and they can be expected to expand to meet the growing demand.

*    Raising the scholarship amount favors the formation of unproven start-up schools over established schools. Because start-up schools can raise the tuition charged to all families they get a fuel injection from $5000 scholarships. Established schools cannot raise tuition without adversely impacting their fee-paying families. Their engines are shifted to neutral. they get no benefit and may be harmed. Florida's predictable experience from both the McKay and the Opportunity Scholarships is that the start-up schools generated the adverse press. 

There are many other reasons that can be offered, but this isn't the place. Raising the scholarship amount is just not warranted at this time. It is not even being asked for by the private schools. I think this law needs to stay focused on its purpose -school choice - and not be used for another - private school construction.

Thanks for all.

Pat

Thank you for any consideration that you give to the Disabled Students attending public schools in Florida.  As parents of a child with High-Functioning Autism (Aspergers Syndrome), we are very concerned about E.S.E. in our State.  At present our six-year old son has an excellent teacher but recently lost his paraprofessional aide.  This is of major concern to us, as we desire to see him achieve and hopefully excel in education.
 
As you well know, kids like our son can perfectly pronounce the name of every dinosaur that ever lived and give a detailed description of each (or other such "valuable" information).  However, they have great difficulty in a classroom setting much of the time.  Autism is a most unusual disabiliity, in that often times it is not immediately visible to those who do not live with it on a daily basis.      
 
Thank you for your concern regarding education and for the disabled students in this State who can learn (and will learn) if given every opportunity to be all that they can be.
 
Our prayers with you and President Bush at this time.  We feel very blessed that we live in the best State in the Union and the best Country in the world!  May God bless the USA!
 
Sincerely,

Anyway, we are proud that our daughter Laura (and two classmates) won the honor of  representing  your state in the Future City Engineering Competition Feb 15-20 in Washington.  It would be great to win the finals!  If you are in Miami at Epiphany anytime soon, the 3 kids on the team would love to have a photo with you.  Only 20 states have qualified to go to Nationals, so a "photo Op" might make for good "educational" PR for the state.  If this perks your interest, please respond. This is very minor, but Epiphany is your parish when in Miami, so the kids would be thrilled!

Governor Bush:

My name is Melissa Blake.  I am seventeen years old and am employed as a
cashier at our local Publix.  A few days ago, I observed something very
disturbing, and I wanted to inform you to this matter.  A few nights ago
while I was working, two women came through my line, obviously mother and
daughter, with the daughter's toddler-aged child.  They had approximately
eight WIC checks, all valid as far as dates are concerned, which
accumulated to about three gallons of milk and two dozen eggs, among
other things.  The WIC checks amounted to close to $40.00.  Next, they
have a moderately sized order.  This order includes: Disney cereal, which
costs about $3.25 a box, sweets and candy, there may have been some soda
in there, and the list goes on.  What disturbs me about this is that this
last order was about $70.00.  And they paid for it with EBT.  There were
no fresh fruits or vegetables in this order.  I believed, before I saw
this, that EBT was supposed to pay for balanced, healthy meals for people
who otherwise cannot afford them.  Everything on that conveyor belt was
approved for food stamps.  I know that because when someone pays with
government aid, we have a food stamp button we must push to separate the
order in the computer and remove the taxes.  I personally believe that
EBT should not pay for these people to "live the high life" of sorts with
food.  I also believe there need to be tougher restrictions on what is
covered by WIC.  Kraft singles cheese, 16oz, is covered by WIC.  This
package of cheese is approximately $2.25, if memory serves me correctly. 
These people by no means should not have the absolute bare minimum, yet
they should also not be milking the government in order to live a nicer
life.  I appreciate your time in reading this, it is a very important
issue to me.  I see our government being taken advantage for a lot in my
job, and it bothers me to see it happen.  Again, thank you so much.  I
will look forward to hearing from you.

Subject: Successful Intelligence Does Not An FCAT Make!!!


Dear Governor Bush;

It is hard for me to believe that I am sitting in front of my computer 
writing this email to you.  Not just because of the issues I am 
concerned about, but because I honestly cannot believe that my children 
will suffer because of legislation that is so insensitive to their God 
given civil rights.

How dare the educational system say that our children have low IQ's 
because they cannot take the FCAT's like others and successfully pass!  
I have two autistic children who are exceptionally bright and very high 
functioning.  I doubt that either of them would be able to take these 
exams the "traditional" way, but I can tell you that with the 
appropriate considerations made for their disability, they could pass 
them.  

I am curious to know if you know of a woman named Temple Grandin?  She 
has autism.  When she was first diagnosed, doctors told her parents 
that she was also mentally retarded because she could not speak and 
only groaned or made incomprehensible sounds for words.  She threw 
severe tantrums, scratched and clawed at herself and others and also 
played in her own feces.  Her parents refused to listen to the 
physicians and sought "special" teachers and other educators to help 
her.  You see; she learned differently than others.  She thought 
in "pictures".  Many years have passed since that time and she is now a 
very successful Associate Professor of Animal Sciences at the 
University of Colorado.  She is known nationally and internationally 
for her books (Thinking in Pictures and Emergence/Labeled Autistic) and 
is sought after for her designs and opinions on raising livestock 
humanely.  

Governor Bush; if you are not familiar with Ms. Grandin, please take 
the time to read her books.  Never in your life will you be able to 
step into the mind of an autistic child and see and feel what they do.  
I learned more about my own two children through this woman than she 
will ever know.  Someday, I hope to shake her hand and thank her.  

I think Ms. Grandin and Robert Steinberg have alot in common.  Mr. 
Steinberg wrote a book called "Successful Intelligence".  He is also 
living proof that traditional methods of testing IQ's and knowledge do 
not work for every child.  Exceptions were made for these people as 
children and they have gone on to prove that the educational systems we 
entrust our children to are not always right.

It has been said that "We do not own the earth; We simply borrow it 
from our children."  How do we give it back to them Mr. Bush, if we are 
not willing to invest in their futures?

I can only hope and pray that you will continue to fight for the rights 
of disabled children in our educational system.  They deserve better 
than what they are being offered and it disgusts me to see sorrow in 
the eyes of such beautiful children at the hands of beaurocracy!

My family will pray for your strength and persistence in safeguarding 
the education of our children.  I hope that you are able to make the 
changes that are necessary as I would hate to regret my relocation to 
the "Sunshine State".

God Bless You and Yours,

Dear Jeb,
I had the opportunity to spend some time this week in Tallahassee with Jim Magill and Sara Struhs to discuss ways in which I can play a significant full-time role working on selected major initiatives of your 2nd term.  As you may know, my daughter Karen is now a graduate student in Political Science at FSU and is interning in Sen. Lee Constantine's office.  She was able to arrange these meetings for me.  Whatever support you can provide for me with your Transition Team would be greatly appreciated.  I have the support and recommendations of George LeMieux, Ed Pozzouli, Johnnie Byrd and Connie Mack.  
Best regards, Sandy

Subject: Sallie Mae


Governor:  I understand from Sally that you were concerned with the meetings we scheduled yesterday with our client Sallie Mae and both Sec. Horne and his staff and Kathleen Shanahan.  For the record, these were intended to be two seperate meetings.  Our first meeting with Sec. Horne, Larry Wood, Wayne Pierson and Dan Woodring was to discuss the details of the privitization request and get some feedback from them on issues that need to be addressed as we move forward.  The second meeting was specifically for your Chief of Staff to address the role of the Governor in the process - the federal law clearly assigns the role of state guarantor to that of the Governor, not the chief state school officer.  As you recall, we addressed this issue in Miami.  It was never our intention, nor was it at our invitation, to have Sec. Horne and his staff, who are equally busy,  attend this second meeting.  It was as much to our surprise to see a room full of the same people at the second meeting.  We appreciate the time of your staff and would never schedule a meeting just for the sake of meeting.  Also for the record, Sallie Mae is a client we have represented for nearly two years.  They compensate us based upon a monthly retainer, just like all of our clients.  There are no benefits to us for additional meetings.  
 
I just wanted to clear up any confusion and close the loop on this.  Let me know if you need to discuss further.

        Can you make an emphatic statement that you will not accept expanded gambling, in the form of video lottery terminals at existing pari-mutuels?

        It seems to me your stalwart opposition to that in the past has thwarted discussion of it in the Legislature. 
        But lately, it seems you have moved toward the "everything is on the table" mode until we sort out this year's budget.

        Am I wrong? Are you willing to negotiate? Or would you like to rule it out?

Dear Governor Bush:

Congratulations on the mandate you received from the citizens of Florida at
election time.  You deserved it.

I’m sorry I have taken an extra month in reestablishing our email talks
about how my healthcare group and I can make a major improvement in health
care for all of Floridians.  I took care of my 93 year old father after his
last stroke, until his death last week.

If you can spare some informal time on an afternoon off, perhaps a backyard
meeting in blue jeans, I would like to drive to Tallahassee to engage in
what I believe would be a most rewarding chat with you – an event that has
the potential to benefit all Floridians who want higher quality and more
affordable health care.  Our plan includes a means for the enrollment of
those Floridians who are not able to afford a health plan today.

We plan to implement our new healthcare plan with credit for its inspiration
and  assistance attributed to you.  I look forward to your reply.

Governor Jeb Bush
Tallahassee, Florida

FACTS
On January 21, 2003 an agreement ("Protocolo") was signed in Madrid between
Miami-Dade County and La Comunidad de Madrid, the regional government of
Madrid, whereby the two governments have partnered to cooperate in higher
education, and back-up their commitments by jointly funding the operations
of the FIU Madrid-Miami Center for Education, Research and Development, with
matching funds and support from the Fundación Universitaria San Pablo-CEU of
Madrid, Spain, and FIU.

OPPORTUNITY
At a time when the State of Florida has been forced to cut back its funding
to state universities, I believe you can emphasize, during your trip to
Madrid and by visiting the FIU Center (one block from the US Embassy in
Madrid), that through your leadership, new and innovative private/public and
local/international partnerships are being created in the higher education
arena. These initiatives can serve as a model for other similar endeavors
assuring the funding needed to further expand the existing excellent
relationships between Spain and Florida (gateways to Europe and the
Americas).
Also, with private partners such as Telefonica, the FIU Madrid Center will
become a focal point of virtual community for scientists from all over the
world. Thus, the State of Florida and its universities are, and will
continue, to fulfill the responsibility of enhancing the quality of life of
its citizens by supporting higher education and thus enhancing international
trade and commerce.

I am attaching--via fax--an additional fact sheet for your staff, as well as
published articles in relation to the signing of the "Protocolo" in Madrid.
I will gladly work with your staff to coordinate your visit to the FIU
Madrid Center.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Sincerely yours,

Rafael Diaz-Balart

Subject: DOEA controversial decision - ALF trainer program


Gov Bush 

I am writing you to inform about a BAD decision that Sec White is making relative to the alleged "privitization" of the ALF trainer program.  I object to his use of the term privitization when he is really carving out a monoply for the area agencies on aging (AAA).  I think we can all agree that privitization means getting the private sector involved through a competitive process, not creating a new monopoly that whose aim is to generate revenue for the ailing AAA's. 

The BAD part of Sec White's decision is that it impacts in an adverse manner the assisted living facilities that accept state funded residents.  Many facilities that accept state funded residents will send their caregivers and frontline staff to the various training programs made available by the ALF trainers ( nutrition, medication management and CORE training).  I can tell that as someone who has for 15 years sent my caregivers to these course they help us effect the necessary paradigm shift to develop an average paraprofessional into a valuable ALF employee, further this investment in staff development often encourages these people to pursue their education to the next level ( CNA or LPN).  Once the AAA have taken over the program many of the speakers that once provided segments of the 5 day CORE training course will now want compensation since they are no longer doing this for a public agency.....this in turn will increase costs. 

If the AAA increase the rates to the ALF providers, the private pay facilities will pass along the costs to their customers and the facilities that accept state funded residents will have to reduce the number of people they send to these excellent training programs.  This reduction in training as I am sure you would agree can only result in a negative outcome such as increased staff turnover, poor care skills among new hires and costly mistakes. 

The vast majority of the ALFs that accept state funded residents are owned and operated by minorities and a large percentage of the caregivers are also minorities.  The potential for a trainwreck with the current approach Sec White is taking can only speel big problems for the facilities and caregivers who really need access to this training the most. 

I admire your bold stand on reducing government and thank you for working hard everyday to solve problems created by government.  While I agree with you on the need to reduce government and increase the role of the private sector I hardly think the poorly thought out plan now in place at DOEA will create the benefits we would all seek and appreciate. 

In september of 2002 the DOEA paid for a study of whether to privatize the ALF trainer program through the Pepper Institute.  The report clearly states that the ALF trainer program is cost effective and should be retained by the DOEA.  I would like to know why that in the face of a study the DOEA paid to have done and opposition among the people most directlty affected why Sec White is moving ahead with a plan that could create a huge problem for the people that need it the most. 

Again, thank you for your leadership and interest in what happens here on the operational level.  I am certain that there is a reasonable compromise that can be achieved if only the DOEA leadership was willing to listien.

Congratulations on the strong finish and not resting on your laurels.  When you are a leader, you understand that the key to failure is trying to please everybody.  I am glad you follow your beliefs, regardless of the special interest ink that the press loves to spread.
I believe that the ground work for an even higher position is being laid, and I for one wouldn't mind you keeping it in the family.
 
1-Some leadership foundations.  You manage things while you lead people.
2-A ship in the harbor is safe, but that is not what ships were made for.
3-Leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality.
4-Leaders must be close enough to others to relate yet far enough ahead to motivate them.
5-A man who wants to lead the orchestra must turn his back on the crowd.
 
If you like these, I will send you five of these each week.  You, like myself, probably love to have the metaphors and crystal statements that can cut through the chaff and nail a point home, especially when you really don't want to expound on it.
Have a glorious week.

I know that Amendment 9 and other issues made this year's budget a difficult one, but I ask you to please pray about reconsidering funding the faith-based transitional aftercare beds. I believe that like the President, you also support faith-based initiatives. SB912 was the first ever specific "faith-based" legislation in Florida, please keep it alive. One solution is to remove the 58 DOC FTE's. That funding (which is the lions share) is not essential. I guarantee you I can make sure that the beds get filled without those positions. We are only talking about $2,920,000.00. Four hundred beds at $20.00 a day. This is a tremendous public safety issue as well as a fiscal issue. Governor Bush, I know that you know that transitional aftercare is critical to reducing recidivism. My program is working. We are significantly reducing addiction, crime and the rate of re-incarceration.

Governor,
 
I want to run an idea by you.  I am working on some projects with Kay Stephenson's group SmartCops.  They partner on many projects with Steve Goldsmith at ACS and with Nextel.  My concept is to take the ChildTrack program that Steve told you about and combine it with the Nextel phone and snap on camera.
 
Basically it would work like this.
Case worker arrives at childs location.  Dials office number on Nextel Phone.  Child Track application runs on Nextel phone, caseworker enters childs ID and answers 3-5 questions on basic condition.  Then caseworker uses Nextel camera to take childs picture.  All Nextel phones have a GIS chip and time stamp.  So central database is immediately updated with Child's picture, location and timestamp.  This would eliminate ability to falsify visit reports.  It also would satisfy blue-ribbon panel recommendation for pictures as well as provide photographic evidence of childs condition every time they are visited.  There are a lot of other features and benefits, but that was the high point.
 
Every caseworker already has a cell phone so that cost will be minimal.  Steve says that with a better tracking system the state should be able to pull down a significant amount of Title IV-E dollars which (according to Steve) may completely offset costs.
 
Nextel and ACS are high on the potential for the project.  I am going to try and get with Jerry Regier soon to discuss, but wanted to see if you had any feedback first.
 
Thanks

Jeb

Your statement on Columbia was very good--you said I think pretty much how
we all feel.  We all get complacent and forget just how cutting edge and
dangerous space exploration is. Nasa makes it look so easy. The people that
fly, and build, these machines are very special, as they always have been,
it would be nice if we all could relearn that and given our astronauts the
distinction we did the original seven astronauts.  Remember the awe and
excitement of the space program when you and I were boys?  If we could
recapture just some of that, it would be terrific.  What a tribute to this
crew, and to Nasa, to get America once again inspired as we once were.

Take care Jeb

Ladies and Gentlemen,
 
America needs Tomorrow Land more today then in the recent past. Allow me to introduce myself. I am a 52 y/o college educated BA'72 Moravian College psychology major. I work for Veterans Affairs as an alcohol and drug counselor.
 
Recently I moved to Florida and I began going to the places that were too far away or too expensive while growing up. However, while growing up, I remember the nutty professor who explained space to boy scouts and I remember other Disney "training films" about blood.  I remember Walt,on Sunday nights, This show was never seen until the homework was completed and tomorrow's clothing was prepared. 
 
I believe a concerted effort is needed to reestablish NASA, and space travel after yesterday's tradgedy.  I believe America's Tomorrow Land must be brought to today's children and I believe Disney has a part in America's dream.  Below is a copy of an e-mail I sent to JEB Bush.

Mr. Governor,
 
As I listen to the news and reflect on the magnitude of America's loss, I grapple with an appropriate response.  It will be The Federal Government's responsibility to rebuild the space program.  The Kennedy Space Center (KSC) is in Florida.  I believe Floridians must help to remember the brave astronauts from several countries and academic achievements.
 
I realize state budget discretionary money is tight and education is tied up in classroom size and test scores.  Perhaps a scholarship program could be funded by the citizens of Florida to educate future astronauts. What future can be more bright than, Gene Rodenberry's "the final frontier"? 
 
Perhaps you could proclaim a need for donations with state and business matching funds. Once the money is invested, students could be picked and sent to Florida schools for the expressed purpose to study scientific space related course work.
 
Of course, all education is good education and most academic fields are used at KSC. That being said, think of the excitement a program like this could generate for the sake of education. If space is colonized, the settlements will even need politicians. 
 
Sincerely,
Craig G. Eifert

Please forward this to the appropriate Disney Company Representative.  Together we can dream and create a new America.

I don’t know for certain if I can, but I would like to find a win-win situation coming from you for the citizens of the state concerning the state library.
 
I am trying to work with some businessmen to approach you with ideas to permit the state library to remain open and continue services but with some type of private/state partnership.  (I have the promise of support to help recruit businessmen to set up an endowment, and I also have the offer of some very influential lobbyists to help me with the legislature to reach a satisfactory goal.)  But I have yet to make contact with the business that I hear is interested and might take the lead.
 
The Florida Library Assn is grateful for the emphasis you have placed in the budget for local libraries. But, professionally, FLA has no choice but to oppose closing the state library.  They've spent the last two days pointing out long-term professional consequences, which will occur to local libraries if some of the library pieces are not in place.
 
I’m not sure how my group will react to the above proposal but if the choice is losing 10 million dollars in state library resources I believe they could be convinced.  It might be good to have them at the table at some point if the above is possible.  And I must admit spending the session fighting your office is not number one on my list.

Subject: Foster children regards to Kim Dobson

Dear Sir,
    
      I am a close friend of Kim and Kenny Dobson who have been fostering
two young children for several months now and the situation as to how
they got involved is really rather extraordinary, the biological Aunt who
had been caring for the children after the mom had been put in jail found
due to her age the two young children were to much. Since Kim and  Kenny
were family friends they were familiar with the children and when they
found out the Aunt couldn't care for them decided they would go through
all the necessary counseling and home studies to be able to care for
these children, just so they wouldn't be placed in a unfamiliar place, if
my memory serves me right that was almost a year ago that they started
the process.
     The children seem to adapted very well, to my surprise I was on the
phone with Kim and I heard the little girl call her mommy so I questioned
her and asked her what did she call the Aunt and she said by her name. My
point is the children were comfortable enough in a very short time to
refer to her as mom but not that comfortable with there own Aunt.
     Kim has keep me informed with the process as it unfolded, and there
were/are several things I find very hard to understand, first why has the
whole court case taken place over the phone, and since the are at this
time a ward of Florida why don't Florida's Social workers check out the
father? Second why after so much time passing is the father interested
and why hasn't that been questioned.  And mostly if the father has failed
drug test why in God's name would any Judge turn over custody of a 2 and
3 year old. Not to mention it's my understanding that the mother had an
older child who had admitted that the father not only allowed the minor
to use drugs, but introduced them to her.
     Quit frankly if this is the type of Judges we have sitting on our
benches then God help us all especially the little children who can speak
for them selfs. 
      Thank you for taking the time to listen to a concerned citizen.

Sincerely,
Sandra Dunaway

Basic training for FCAT


By Campbell Roth, Palm Beach Post Staff Writer
Sunday, February 2, 2003



WEST PALM BEACH -- In a little room of Mount Moriah Baptist Church on 
Saturday, 10-year-old Bianca Baxter peered at a work sheet on the desk in 
front of her. Bright and early, the fourth-grader abandoned her bed and 
ignored the balmy weather that beckoned from outside to come to the church 
and study.

After last year, when she was terrified she "wasn't going to pass" the 
required Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test, she said giving up a 
Saturday morning wasn't as important as getting serious about the multiple 
tests that begin Feb. 11.

At Mount Moriah and 19 other churches throughout the county, the Urban 
League of Palm Beach County provides students like Baxter free tutoring for 
the FCAT. The program began in late January 2002 in response to minority 
students' low scores on the required exam.

Even though it has been a priority since 1998, black and Hispanic students 
have not closed the achievement gap in Palm Beach County. No matter whether 
they're in third grade or 10th grade, black students continue to lag an 
average of more than 50 points behind white students on the FCAT. Hispanic 
students lag about 40 points behind.

It's a serious problem, especially because all students must pass the 
10th-grade test to graduate and all third-graders have to pass to advance to 
the fourth grade.

The Rev. Michael Payne, youth development director for the Urban League, 
said community leaders wanted to do something to improve minority students' 
scores.

They decided that two local churches, Mount Gilead on Division Avenue and 
Mount Moriah on Tamarind Avenue, would open on Saturday mornings so 
neighborhood kids could practice math, reading and writing with the help of 
volunteers.

School district data shows that those who participated in last year's 
program passed the FCAT at a rate of 80 percent, compared with dismal scores 
for minority students overall. For instance, nearly 70 percent of black 
10th-graders failed, compared with 29 percent of white students.

"The response from parents was, 'We need to do this year-round,' " Payne 
said.

In September, the program, dubbed "Weekend Warriors," began again.

Now, the program exists in 20 churches and Payne said the league is trying 
to expand it to more churches and attract more volunteers.

West Palm Beach resident Lisa Krach said she's grateful for the program. 
After watching her daughter, 10-year-old Amanda, come home from Coral Reef 
Elementary every day in tears, terrified of the upcoming FCAT, Krach figured 
the school wasn't providing sufficient preparation.

"It came to a point where the pressure was changing her personality," Krach 
said.

She hired a tutor to meet with Amanda every week, but when she heard about 
the program, she thought it would be a great addition, she said.

"She's doing wonderfully," Krach said of Amanda's progress. "You just have 
to take each student and find out what their needs are."

Johnnie Mae Brown, a volunteer at Mount Moriah, said the children need 
little more than affirmation to boost their confidence.

"We have a lot of kids who know, but they don't know they know," Brown said. 
"They aren't disgusted or frustrated. These are just kids who want to 
learn."

Your response was significantly less than what I was expecting.  Based 
on the current public outcry in regard to disabled children and the 
FCAT's, I do not see the changes that you are speaking of.  I am very 
interested in what the educational system has to offer my children.  
Can you please elaborate on these issues?  Thank you so much for your

Please return to us and cheer us up to build this new ship to the stars.  Come back to the Garden Jeb.  Come to the University of Florida.

Thanks to you and yours and God Bless you.
=========================================================================

Columbia, Oh Columbia, let there be light Columbia.

Across the sky streaked white and blue incandescence turquoise too.  The flame of heroes old and new of peace and joy of heaven do … the things that make us better still are written in these flames unreal.  The stars therein we made this day burned shortly bright and found their way to homes and live-forever found the new beginning: 

The final round!

They took their craft in gleaming gloam it’s beauty bound to heavens roam.  They took their time to find the plane where only they can be today.  The skies and stars closed in on them.  The skies and stars drew in on them.  And now their being, essence zest, its poignancy, its magnificence find words to weather the task of saying how they gave their last …  

The final measure!

They gave all they had to do those things of past life heroes on freedoms wings in joy and being in wondrous seeing the order natural in chaos seething.   Another man  … another day … another star … fell too in Texas … we heard him say …

“We do these things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard."

In the hardness of this day find peace and joy from JFK to hear me say that there is life and there is wonder in those stars above her thunder.
 
 Columbia, Oh Columbia, the burden given Columbia!

Go now to your leaders say, do no thing to take away the freedoms won in other lands are not to take by no mans hand.  We are free and we are wise and we can take no other lives.  

Columbia Oh Columbia the wisdom given Columbia!

There once were giants where men now stand and in there place with heavens hand we have the wondrous mysterious clue of futures past that we once knew. They fell to earth this morning day.  They fought to live they fought for life ... they fought for being and we lost their voices but not their light.

Columbia Oh Columbia, give us to light Columbia.  

And when this knowledge and time has past will you say you past’d the test?   For pharaohs, kings and presidents have part and parcel …  have time  … have quests … have had vision clear and dull … have had nightmares seared in hell.  They have had choices clear as well they have had lives to burn do tell.   As one great pharaoh in African past on to say … to write …  to do … to last … to tell that tale he said that day … to make it work … to make it play … that words that rhyme that mystery speak of leaders past of leaders weak.  These words they matter, these words they wonder, what god has made let none tear asunder.  Wise words find those friendly ears can these words of wisdom seek those to understand?  For words alone are not what make the heroes found in heaven take more that words, take more than action, take time and money take facts and …  

Life takes sometimes more than offered life takes all king-ed wizened prophets …  Rameses, Jesus, Cousteau and brethren said to those in wisdoms office: 

 “So let it be written … so let it be DONE.”   So let sunshine rays of pristine learning go out to find peace our souls are yearning to find in light our fallen heroes amplified wisdom of our brightest SUN. 

WE SING! Columbia Oh Columbia, let there be light Columbia.  Gods’ Loves to Columbia.

Dear Governor Bush,
Please reconsider the recent cuts made in the funding of Pace Center for Girls.  I have personally seen the wonderful guidance and education that they have provided for girls who would probably become problems in our society.  Rather than cost our juvenile justice system more money they are sending these girls off to productive lives in our communities.  It is so much better to spend the funds on a positive solution than on building more facilities to incarcerate these girls.  Pace is a wonderful place for these girls to become contributing members of our society.  Having attended several functions at Pace I have been able to see first hand the guiding force their counselors and teachers have made.
I am a business owner in Seminole County.  I have a manufacturing facility that employs 23.  Before I became a business owner I was a high school math teacher.  I love working with young people and know that they need mentors who care about them and want them to be successful.  A school such as Pace has a much better chance of guiding these girls in my opinion.
Thank you for your time.
I wish you great success in your term as governor and future endeavors.

Subject: Restoring Rights to Felons


Honorable Governor Bush: 
I believe that if the people of the sovereign state of Florida wanted it differently they would find the ways and means to change the process. 
The extreme liberal goups bent on destroying everything that made our country great; including law and consequences, seem to ignore the fact that the percentage of mistakes that have brought on this aura of innocence for convicted felons is very low compared to the inhumane treatment of victims and the suffering endured by relatives of victims in our society. 
Yes, the number of felons that are black and hispanics makes up the majority of felons convicted and many of them eventually released to perpetrate worse crimes against society.  Recividism proves this out. 
However, the fact remains that blacks and hispanics are the ones committing the crimes for which they are convicted and sent to serve time in the penal system. 
There was a time in America, not so distant away when the penal institutions were inhabited by mostly white felons and career criminals. 
History will show that upward mobility in the social strata changed all that to include new groups of people who are now occupying the levels of the strata that were once occupied by those that have moved up. 
As long as individuals choose to perpetrate crimes against innocent victims; the elderly, chldren, women, business persons who get up early in the morning and work until late at night and end up becoming victims of vicious criminals who besides robbing them inflict death upn them, women sleeping comfortably in the privacy of their homes and end up being raped and killed, and the such, there has to be a system through which the perpetrators are exacted a consequence similar to the act perpetrated against inncoent and law abiding citizens. 
I believe that if the people of Florida choose to find other relief than that which is established, they will concern themselves with such actions through the proper procedures. 
The bleeding hearts that patronize such changes have never had a relative or dear one suffer the fear and pain exacted by the cowardly criminals on victims of inhuman criminal activity. 
I spent 31 years in the system and the horror of these crimes never escapes memory and if an emotional police officer smacks one of these beasts, they holler police brutality and run for cover under the umbrella of the constitution and the bill of rights. 
Where does the victim find refuge?  In a hole in the ground six feet deep. 
Where is the fainrness of the  justice system? 
I hope and pray you stick to your position up to now and tell those more interested in the rights of felons than those of hones, hard working, law abiding citizens, to blow Dixie. 
God Bles you and your family

Subject: Bond Sale and Proposal for Additional Refundings


Governor Bush:

	We sold $277 million of PECO bonds yesterday at 4.31%. The
transaction was part refunding, part new money.  The refunding piece
generated present-value savings of $13.9 million.  I was pleased with the
sale and the level of savings generated.

	In thinking about ways we can save the State money, it occurred to
me that it may be an opportune time, with the President's tax proposal on
the table, to pursue changes to the tax code beneficial to State and local
governments.  Current federal tax law limits State and local governments'
ability to lower its borrowing cost through refinancings by allowing only
one advance refunding during the life of a bond issue.  The policy
underlying this rule is to limit the federal subsidy (the feds consider
tax-exempt debt as a federal subsidy because the interest is not subject to
federal income taxes) for tax-exempt bonds.  The practical effect on the
State is to prevent us from lowering our debt service costs through
refinancing for bonds that have been advance refunded previously.

	The State has approximately $4.8 billion of debt that cannot be
advance refunded a second time.  Of this amount, approximately $2.8 billion
could be advance refunded at lower rates based on current interest rate
levels.  I estimate potential gross debt service savings of approximately
$161 million (or $121 million on a present value basis) if the State were
allowed an additional advance refunding of its debt.  In our case, most of
the savings is on PECO bonds so the savings could help us pay for class size
reduction.  To the extent the savings are used for additional school
construction, it could also provide stimulus for the economy.  

	I am bringing this to your attention because it seems timely in
light of the President's tax plan and reasonably consistent with some of the
policy objectives underlying the proposal.  It also has the added virtue of
potentially saving the State money during these difficult economic times by
allowing us to take advantage of lower interest rates.  Additionally, there
is some precedent to this idea in that Congress allowed New York City
issuers an additional advance refunding in connection with the relief
provided for rebuilding lower Manhattan from the destruction caused by the
9/11 terrorist attacks.

	By way of background, an additional advance refunding seems to be a
perennial request from State and local government groups, other issuers of
tax-exempt bonds and industry trade groups so it is not really a novelty on
Capitol Hill.  I would not be surprised to see it surface again in
connection with the tax bill.  Also, Treasury is never keen on expanding
authority for tax-exempt bonds.  I just wanted you to be aware of this and
consider whether it has sufficient merit to pursue in some way.

	As always, I am available at your convenience to discuss this issue
or answer any questions you may have.  Please let me know if you have any
interest in pursuing this.

Letters to the Editor

The Suncoast News

6214 U.S. 19

New Port Richey, FL 34652

 

Subject: Lack of maps on fire trucks and public safety

 

A fire took place on 14 January 2003 at approximately 1945 (all military time used in Pinellas County) in the home of Bill and Sandy Faulkner, at 1850 Stable Trail, Palm Harbor, FL ("Eagles Ridge" subdivision).

 

This fire was called into Central Dispatch on 911. It was assigned as FD Incident #3005087. The two 911 calls were assigned #3018717 and #3018719. 

 

East Lake Fire & Rescue Station 56, 1933 East Lake Road, Palm Harbor, FL was dispatched at 1955 and arrived at the scene of the fire at 1959. The distance from the firehouse garage door to the residence where the fire took place is two tenths of a mile (1,056ft.)  The fire company is located at the intersection, which on the west side is named North Boot Ranch Road and on the east side, Woodland, and crosses East Lake Drive Road.

 

The fire station has control of these lights, which can be turned to "red" in both directions, thereby stopping traffic in all directions. While I was at the firehouse and collecting some of the aforementioned facts, Station 56 received a fire alert. I went outside to observe procedures. They stopped all traffic both ways and were driving the truck out via the Woodland exit, thence on to East Lake Road and heading south, in a time of twenty-five seconds.

 

However, the fire equipment did not arrive at the fire location for more than 5 minutes. When asked by the owner of the home "What took so long?" and that he could hear the sirens going around other streets in Eagles Ridge before they arrived. The reply he received from the fireman was, "We did not have a map to locate your residence."

 

In reality, this residence is directly across the street from the firehouse. You drive approximately 100 feet on North Boot Road, make a left turn, go 50 feet and then go right for approximately 200 feet on Stable Trail Road. This total distance of 1,056 feet took me less than one minute, when I crossed over East Lake Road from the firehouse (with a red light) and to this residence.

 

Had this station been provided with the proper directions, the extensive damage, which was done to the home, may have been less. Take into consideration had this fire occurred when the residents of this home were sleeping, we may have been attending a funeral for a family of four instead of helping to resettle the family in a temporary residence. 

 

One can only be amazed that the majority of pizza establishments can deliver a pizza anywhere, while the fire department cannot find a blazing building two-tenths of a mile away.

 

I recommend that this be investigated and remedied in a short period of time. There are thousands of lives and multi-million dollars worth of property, which are in jeopardy due to not have easy location maps on each and every vehicle.  Presently, Station 56 does not have a laptop computer for either of the two vehicles stationed there.

 

THIS MUST BE REMEDIED IMMEDIATELY.

Brain, Lila, and I met with the telecom lobbyists in early January to get them 
focus their efforts on competition.  They were supposed to have a consensus 
product to us by the end of Jan.  We are continuing to guide them.

They have met nearly twice a week and are still trying to come to a mutual 
agreement on how a plan to increase competition would work.  As is typically 
the case, each company is trying to protect the turf they currently have.  In 
fact, most of them would simply like to re-pass last year's bill, which 
would've entrenched the current state of business.

We are suggesting that they take a regional, not statewide, approach on the 
first attempt.  We asked them to consider creating, what I call, a “Tele-
competition Zone” (much like an Enterprise Zone), where the PSC’s local rate 
regulation would be phased out.  This regional, pilot project would allow us to 
see the dynamics of competition (i.e. work out the kinks of de-reg) and then 
implement at a statewide level later.

Orlando would appear to be the best place to attempt this, as it already has 
the most competition and does not have the high levels of low-income seniors 
that other areas of the state have.

Dr. Wallace -  Myself and millions of other veterans across America were not impressed by the president's state of the union speech. As for the difference between the Republican Party and the Party you mentioned in your article, there is not 2 cents worth of difference between them, as I see it.
 
The president has lied to the veterans about the "Promises  Made - Promises Kept" to the veterans, now that he is in office, he has proven that he is a liar. During his campaign he stated that he would support the veterans, however, once in office he has turned his back on us with a threat of vetoing veteran legislation if it reached his desk. However, the veterans across the great country are mobilizing to vote out ALL officials currently in office, from the President down, regardless of party affiliation if those holding those offices can not or will not pass legislation, get it signed into law, with full funding to keep those promises made to veterans. They have just under 2 years to do the job. There are millions of veterans across America that are watching the progress or lack of progress this congress make on this subject. A bloc vote by the millions of veterans will certainly have an impact on the future of many elected officials. This voting bloc is strictly non-partisan, we will be watching what each member of congress will be doing, regardless of party.
 
So far the big excuse is, "The cost is prohibitive" and the government can not afford it. In his state of the union speech he itemized hundreds of "Billions" of dollars as give away programs to countries and the people of those countries that have never contributed anything to America, much less for themselves. They all have their hands out to get the "FREEBEES" from good old Uncle Sam, many of whom will stab us in our backs as they take and take from us. He did not offer, in his speech, even 1 cent to the veterans this country owes so much to them for fighting its battles and preserving our Freedoms .
 
I hasten to add, veterans believe in helping the peoples of the world but our government owes a long over due debt to many of its own citizens, the veterans. This debt must be paid, first, before offering the huge sums the president itemized in his speech as give away programs to other countries. 
 
If you would like to learn more about this effort and do an article on this cause, please go to web site  <http://www.vets-voting-bloc.org> www.vets-voting-bloc.org.  On February 12, 2003, thousands of veterans will be marching in Washington, D.C in support of a lawsuit against the government. You can learn more about it by going to web site www.classact-lawsuit.com.
 
Thanks for asking for my comments and I sincerely hope that you will do an article on the above subjects as the veterans of America are thoroughly fed up with All the political rhetoric during election years. The only way those in office will get our votes during the next election is to have legislation signed into law with full funding for what was promised and that which was earned.
 
Thanks again,

State of the Union

By Dr. M. Sidney Wallace

 

Your Social Democrats Party believes that George W. Bush is in trouble. According to the latest inside poll, the more Washingtonians see of Bush's policies, the less they understand them.  What the poll shows: 

 

78% that receive governmental aide and benefits, disapprove of the way Bush is handling the economy.  Expecting them to take any job is disrespectful.  

 

93% of those not paying taxes think Bush's latest tax scheme is just a giveaway to the wealthy.  Bush needs to formulate a way of rewarding the non-tax payers for their consumption as well as those who are producing goods and services. 

 

By an overwhelming margin, the Socialist Democrats would rather see the money for Bush's tax scheme go to the education unions, unlimited health care, and “victims benefits” instead of to those that are earning it. 

 

On Tuesday, January 28, President Bush gave his State of the Union address, where he laid out his agenda for the next year.  Everyone already knew what was coming:

 

More tax cuts for the wealthy.  After all, it is impossible to cut taxes for those who do not pay taxes. 

 

Social Security privatization.   George Bush actually believes that the money belongs to the citizens.  He does not understand that in a truly socialistic society that all money belongs to the government. 

 

A fake prescription drug plan written by the drug companies.  Senator Clinton says the drug companies, like tobacco, should be litigated against not be allowed to write legislation.  She believes that if we are to have a truly socialistic society then we must not let economic value be assigned to any individual.  An individual that spends years earning a Ph.D. in biological research should have no greater value than a high school drop out addicted to drugs. We must care for all equally and without limits.  

 

George Bush wants to cut health care, education, environmental protections, and vital services even more than they have already been cut.  I am sure that you can think of the many personal examples of extreme hardships you are currently facing because of the already severe spending cuts after just two years in office.   

 

The Social Democratic Party wants you to be thinking correctly when reflect on the State of the Union speech.  Below are some points to keep in mind when you think about the direction America is taking and what issues are important to you.

 

1. Do you think the nation is better off than it was two years ago?

When was the last time we had a juicy sexual scandal or a White House cover-up in the last two years?

 

2. Make sure the following issues are most important to you when you go to the polls in two years.

The welfare of unions 

Access to unlimited health care with someone else paying for it. 

Teaching Americans that we should let others in the world, like France or Nigeria, lead and thus reducing America’s role as a leader in international affairs. 

Ensuring that women will never have the right to choose anything.

Subject:	Space Exploration is an Open Door

Good evening Jeb:
We all mourn the death of our brave astronauts and the loss of Columbia.
I pray for peace and for strength for their families.

 It seems  few truly understand the significance and imperativeness of
furthering our reach beyond our world to make contact with and become
more knowledgeable about God's Plan for our world as a part of the whole
in his universes. We are not alone in our quest for eternity and the
working out of God's will in our lives. Pervaded and unpervaded space
will reveal untold mysteries for humanity and provide us with new
"enlightenment" beyond belief. Some ask me, how I know this....In faith I
merely say "I just do." 

 If I would have focused on another one of my dreams, it would have led
me on a quest as an astronaut. When I look into the brilliant night sky
it draws me into the understanding of the magnificance of life and just
what lies beyond the new horizons.....my belief is.....many other worlds
at various stages of progress and of light, teeming with life and promise
and discovery. I believe it to be one of the most ego-centric ideas
inhabitants of this world possess to think, that a God, a Creator, with
such potential and possiblity, such perfection would only create one
lowly planet of a struggling and backward form of life in such vastness
of possibilities spinning out into the infinite realms of time and space.


 One day many will experience what some of us already know.

Space exploration is one of the most important quests for the new age
currently being ushered in. The brave souls of Columbia knew of the
importance of this quest.....they too, as I do, felt drawn into the
stars.....God gives us all a part to play.....the astronauts gave the
ultimate sacrifice in the process...... We must continue on with more
vigor and seriousness...with more resolve and willingness to believe that
there are destinies beyond our world that will one day aid us in better
defining our part in the very vast and spacious and busy, whole of
Eternity!

I support space exploration at whatever cost.

Subject: Youth and Constructive Plans


Hi Jeb:
I had a group of friends over this evening and we discussed many social
issues. I was encouraged that they concurred with my belief that one of
the most constructive approaches to help occupy the idle time of our
youth and to guide them more appropriately in matters of responsiblity
and contribution rests in lowering the work age.  My 13 year old son is a
very responsible and capable individual as are many of his friends.  He
asked me recently how old he had to be to get a job. This impressed me
and told me he is thinking more responsibly and with an attitude of
service and contribution. These are nice compliments to go along with his
desire and need to be more independent. 

I believe it is practical to review the labor laws and make changes that
would afford some of our more responsible and more mature youth to enter
the workforce at some level earlier.  This seems to me to be a reasonable
approach as to how to find ways to give our youth something constructive
to do all the while helping them to achieve being responsible
contributors in the process.

Subject: Surgical Technologist "bill"


Dear Governor:

Received a call from a Surgical Technologist in the Kissimmee area telling me you were looking for our bill number. 

To date, I have not been able to get any one in the House or Senate to take our bill on. I have a draft that our National Association and their lawyers put together, that we made applicable to Florida, that can easily be made in to a bill. 

Representative Farkas keeps sending me away saying I need to work out standards of care and regulations for this profession with the Florida Hospital Association. I have tried to explain to him that when we worked through the Florida Commission on Excellence in Health Care in 2000 - 2001 (which you were instrumental in getting us in to) the directive to impose regulation for this profession went right back in to the hands of the hospital, who again did nothing different. The FHA seems to be neutral about regulating. They seem to agree some type of regulation needs to be imposed. 

Senator Saunders, this year said he would ask the Senate President at the end of the session to look at studying the draft through the summer and perhaps bring it up next year.

Another year where the public goes unprotected against unregulated individuals working in the operating room. Why do we have to wait for catastrophes to take place before government intervenes? 

Being the lowest paid professionals in the operating room, we have a very limited budget so we cannot afford a lobbyist. We have to work while we work our proposal. 

I live and work here in Tallahassee. I can bring to your office a short brief of what we have accomplish thus far in the legislature and the draft that we propose for regulating this profession. 

Any help you can give us would be greatly appreciated. I, quite frankly am tired of seeing Florida on those news shows, 20/20 and Dateline, showing all the mistakes and the deaths in the operating room (the death of the 7 year old in the Florida hospital is used Nation wide as a Risk Management video for others to learn from our mistake and... was just shown on 20/20, again, as a 5 year later story -- noting that nothing different has taken place). I can't promise requiring surgical technologists be educated and trained to practice in the operating room will stop all the mistakes, we are all human, but perhaps it may help.

You can reach me at my office, (850) 297-0588, choose option 2, then ext. 118, or my cell (850) 510-7666.

Thank you!

If we were voting, I'd pick Toni Jennings. It would be such a great thing 
for the Republicans to appoint a woman as Lt. Gov. Surely she could give you 
major help with the Legislature, she did a good job as Senate President.


I'm still amazed by the furor over the library cuts. Three or four letters 
to the editor in our paper today. I'm still working on the trust funds 
issue, but won't finish that story this week. Have to take time out to write 
about ASR, water wars and Florida's springs.  I guess the Tampa Bay 
desalination plant will really get going this week. It sure sounds like that 
could be a positive thing for our ongoing water problems.

It's interesting to read in the Governor's newsletter about the economic 
diversification and Latin American trade issues. Sometimes in the little 
corner of the world I focus on, it's easy to forget how many issues need to 
be addressed besides the environment and growth management.

On a side note, I feel sorry for your brother. It seems like he's aging 
before our eyes, it must be an unbelievable weight to be worrying about all 
these incredible crises at the same time. We pray for him daily but still 
...

Take care.

Jeb,
 
This is Todd Josko - I really need a favor regarding my sister.  I am running out of ideas to help her - perhaps you have some ideas or can point me in the right direction.
 
My sister, Colleen, is learning disabled.  She turned 30 last week, but has the mental capacity of someone half that age.  Because of her situation, she has been unable to find a job her entire life.  I am always contacting groups in Sarasota that I believe can help, but so far we have not had any success.  
 
She has worked with Goodwill and Easter Seals, but they mostly just look for jobs already available in the paper, and then ask the prospective employers to give special consideration.  This will not work with her.  She needs a mentorship relationship where someone works one-on-one with her, on the job, over an extended period of time, until she can do the tasks herself without constant supervision.  
 
Colleen is not retarded, but she clearly does not posess the mental aptitude of a normal job applicant. We have never been able to get a specific diagnosis for her disability from several mental health professionals.  It has been a long, frustrating journey for her this far with little results to show.
 
Any suggestions you have on programs, agencies, etc. in the Sarasota area would be greatly appreciated.  I have totally run out of ideas.  Needless to say, my parents are at a loss at what to do at this point as well.
 
Thanks for your help.  It means a lot.

Dear Senator Cowin, 
    I am surprised and concerned to learn that you sponsored a bill that prohibits group homes  within 500 feet of single family residences, with even more stringent requirements for larger group homes which by your own definition includes "families".  At a time when our society is getting more selfish and less caring, the last thing government needs to do is to officially support discrimination against those who are among the most vulnerable in society.   This bill significantly impedes Jeb Bush's goal of strengthening families because it says that society doesn't want certain types of families in our neighborhoods.  Yet all of us know that our neighbors who are not group homes are just as likely  (perhaps more) to create risks in our neighborhoods.  Please change your mind.

Dear Ms. Torres:

This is an alternate e-mail from the rothschildbanc@lycos.com, referenced, below, which is filling up on capacity.

It was very nice meeting you by telephone, today. It is as the result of speaking with the US Ambassador's assistant who referred me to Ms. Hammond who referred me to the Commerce Deparment which resulted in our speaking by telephone. This is the e-mail we discussed.

As mentioned, I am urgently and respectfully re-proposing and requesting by this writing a Consulting Agreement with the United States as a Client at the earliest possible date concerning (1) A Biowar Interned Inteactive Early Warning System as described herein and, including without limitation (2) Think Tank services. In this connection, my company has been awarded as set out on the followig web site: http://www.sba8a.com/yr04/fl102197.htm, an SBA 8(a) participation,  and a US Government and Commercial Entity Number of 053J5. 

Of course there are many sole source methods available for the Contract in addition to the SBA 8(a) which are all sufficient in and of themselves, but it is a plausible addition. The proposed Consulting Agreement, from a not-for-profit, non partison and non-political division of the Company set out here is for Think Tank services for the US and where appropriate, ISRAEL, and others agreeable to them are in the "third wave of think tank" traditions as set out by Richard Haass, Director of Policy and Planning of the U.S. Department of State, in his recent article entitled "THINK TANKS AND U.S. FOREIGN POLICY: A POLICY-MAKERS PERSPECTIVE with the capabilities of the Company set out in the Company web site at: http;//'stephenalrothschild.tripod.com. The Company's advocasy, controversy resolution, economic, advisory, research and development capabilities along with its other capabilities in information systems development, social and environmental infrastructure development, advance

d research and technology development acquisition and as listed on the respective web sites are all present there as well as in the references and referals at http://angelfire.com/super/aim. The Company's issue focus is set out in the references web sites in both the domestic and foreign policy areas.

The Company's primay proposal for Consulting Agreement from its for-profit area hereby re-proposed is for the following services regarding The Biowar Interactive Early Warning and Security Defense System (the "System") which was submitted in 1997 during the prior Administration was to be appropriately and properly implemented and to make America ready with a secure homeland defense, then, and it has not been implemented or presented to the President, yet, but rather misappropriated and set-on an improper track. It may be too late to perform its appropriate and proper implementation before the next Biowar attack, if we do not act, now. As the proposed System protected individual privacy, as well, its delay has caused the Bush administration and the American public terribly severe and unnecessary headaches, worry and disunity at a time when America and America's president deserve responses and solutions building for unity and security. In all humility and modesty it is time to st

and up to the job of putting in the right defense for America and her allies. The Biowar Interactive Warning System as proposed is believed far faster (over 200% plus) and more pervasive than the new Bioterror Monitor technique announced, last week. Knowing, of course, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, there can be no guarantees, the Biowar Early Warning System as proposed, before and now, here, appropriately and properly implemented, would, in all humility and modesty (1) provide you and the President, the Commerce Department, the Terrorist Threat Integration Center and the President's Counterproliferation Technology Coordination Committee, and American and her Allies, with the necessary, but missing and critically vital earliest real-time instrumentation revealing subtle suspicious vital life sign deviations among vast populations (2) while protecting and enhancing the privacy rights of the people, (3) and enabling the greatest in-time response for the most effective 

deterrence and mitigation protecting Americans and America's allies. But, the Biowar Early Warning and Defense System is still delayed since March 31st, 1997, by the prior administration, while America is facing its greatest terrorists risks. It was on or about that date I submitted a Proposal for the System to DARPA and others in the prior Administration by which I provided The Biowar Interactive Early Warning System White Paper forecasting the likelihood of sneak anthrax and other sneak biowar attacks against Americans and America's allies' and their populations. The Biowar Early Warning System was proposed for implementation in 1997 as the only suitable instrument to begin protecting Americans and America's allies against the unwarranted risks perceived to exist at that time and shown to have been, unfortunately, all too correct. This is a re-proposal, delayed by disruptive circumstances (1) respectfully and urgently requesting an Initial Consulting Agreement for an even imp

roved Biowar Interactive Early Warning System, recommended by Dr. Nancy Miller, (former) United States Air Force Acquisition and Program Manager, set out below, together with John F. McCarthy, Jr, attorney, a key partner in America's and the world's largest labor law firm practicing exclusively in America, (2) including a One Page Summary, attached. The part of the balance of this letter describes the current situation, in which almost five (5) years after submission, finally, by letter Dated January 4, 2002, Dr. Anna Johnson-Winegar, Ph.D., with whom I first had contact at Chemical/Biological Defense in 1999, thanks me for..."...(your)...support of the DoDChemical and biological Defense Program and for the welfare of U. S. Military forces.." as I had been continuing attempts during the prior administration to gain implementation of the Biowar Early Warning System before American lives and resources which would be saved, were tragically lost. Dr. Anna Johnson-Winegar's response

 was most revealingly and perhaps with all due respect to her, courageous, as regarding one of the several continued submission's during the Clinton administration and well before the September 11, 2001 attacks. She disclosed that the Department had been only involved in a process for "..identifying outbreaks of non-battle related illnesses for the deployed soldiers...(and)...also working closely with civilian public health services as they develop methodologies.." but nothing more and nothing had been mentioned to have been conceived or implemented for the comprehensive Biowar Early Warning and Defense System implementation proposed by me as an integrative contractor to provide the American population and those of America's allies with the comprehensive deterrence and mitigation protec tion offered by the System which was offered during the prior Administration in 1997. Now, once the tragedy of September 11, 2001, and the time related anthrax deaths occurred, Dr. Anna Johnson-

Winegar is quoted as saying "shame on us" for not acting earlier. Indeed. So they have announced they will do something, now, after receiving repeated proposals to provide the System and after September 11, 2001, occurred, by using the trade secreted ideas/concepts without consent of the proponent and by spending $300,000,000 on it, but, they are admitting they do not have a model, only the ideas I tradesecreted and submitted. Moreover, they admittedly do not know how to implement it and, as a consequence they are running late, on the wrong path, and causing the Bush administration and America great unnecessary problems and greater risks. Let American's admit we can no longer be tied to the prior administration's continuing inaction and methods of denial resulting in no defense or a sham defense from which the Bush Administration will have to dig out. If given a real chance, I will go forward as the owner of the intellectual property and the author of and one who presented it t

rade secreted, with a good tradesecreted model to provide the Bush administration and the American people and America's allies better humanitarian and ethical safeguards, better public acceptance, better public appreciation and better implementation than evidenced by the languishing years of the prior administration's fiddling. Please allow me to help in response to President Bush’s assessment that .."..The United States has a critical need for cutting-edge technology that can quickly and effectively detect, analyze, facilitate interdiction of, defend against, defeat, and mitigate the consequences of WMD (weapons of mass destruction)..." The Biowar Interactive Early Warning and Defense System, properly implemented will help you do that better than otherwise possible giving you more time to breath, as did the Integrated Approach for the New York Times I presented resulted in a milestone for the world's greatest newspaper in the management of electronic news records.

Subject:	FYI: More background on the Graceville problem FYI

Here somoe more info on that Graceville matter I brought to your
sattention last week. 

The City of Graceville received a Leg. Appropriation in FY 2002 of
$226k, which was titled "Wastewater/water improvement-Jackson."  This
appropriation was originally submitted to Sen. Al Lawson, Rep. Don
Brown, and Rep. Bev Kilmer as the "Ezell Waterline Extension" as per our
documentation.  They were successful in that it was passed through the
Senate and House to include the Governor's Water/Wastewater advisory
panel.  At which point it was sent to the Governor for signature/
approval.  Upon return from the Governor's office the title had been
changed to "Wastewater/ water improvement - Jackson".

To make a long story short, is it possible to re-appropriate these funds
without a lengthy process for its original intent?  That fair city is in
dire need of Water due to low volume and pressure in several sectors. 
Our immediate concern is in the sector which houses our friends at
Campbellton-Graceville Hospital, The Fla. Baptist College Plus the
Jackson County Convalescent Center as it relates to adequate Fire
Suppression. 

Thanks again for looking into this metter kind sir!

Subject:	Re: parents for prison reform

Judy:
You and I both know that the Inspector General's office does not question the word of an officer, that is why set ups can occur with nothing being done.  

All of us parents know that the grievance process isn't worth the paper that they are written on, there is no fair due process.  It is an empty sham.  How many grievance issues are ever overturned?  Those are some of the exact issues we as parents will discuss that we believe procedures needs to be changed.  Our sons are being subjected to loss of freedoms and to punishment without any fair or just legal process.  

Don't tell me that the DOC doesn't want to see our sons come to any harm. 
Without a fair due process, they are being harmed.  

Without leaders willing to oversee that state and federal regulation are followed, and leaders that are willing to question the actions of officials and officers, they will continue to be harmed.  

There are beatings and rapes and gassing and set ups and abusive treatment and an overwhelming flood of drugs in our Florida institutions.  Parents and inmates have been reporting this and no one cares enough to question. 
Stop this corruption and then tell me that the DOC does not want our incarcerated loved ones to be harmed!

I guess you didn't ask how many staff positions were cut in education, and how many of our mandatory drug programs are still in operation, and how many vocational programs each institution was left.  Let's not discuss the true skill value of most masonry, horticulture, or culinary arts programs, or the pet projects that sound good, but have little access for the majority of inmates. 

Recidivism is reduced by educational programs and vocational programs that transfer to actual job skills.  We have a great many inmates that are housed in solitary for years at a time, CM is being used instead of reform programs.  

Punishment without rehabilitation, that's Florida's policy.

Dear Jeb Bush,     
 
       I am writing in refference to a Pinellas County Sheriffs Child Protection Officer. Ms. Frances Rodriguez came in to my home on January 31, 2003. She was assigned the case on me three weeks or more prior to coming to my door. As all of these investigators due she wanted to come in and ask me some questions about my children and living conditions. I have been if full responce with her questioning. But at the end of the interview with me she informed me that she didn't know me from dirt. !!! I was told I was mentaly unstable and she would be back to take my children out of my home if I did not seek help. I do however see a phyicatrist, and counselor for Mental depression. I wounder how she could come into my home and then tell me that I am a mentaly unstable person. Then look through my home and ask where certain items came from and why did I spend money on these unessessary items. I informed her that the items in question were given to me as gifts for christmas. These items were very trivial. They were Bucaneers poster, hat , cup ect. I informed her once again a friend gave them or had bought them for me. She then told me to get him to pay my bills ect. He is not a live in boyfriend, nore is he my childrens father!!! Where does she get off telling me to ask someone a friend at that to pay my bills. She all so informed me that she told my ex to take me back to court and reduce child support? My son at his fathers and my verbal agreement was for him to take Adam my son for two weeks and then bring him home. In my exhusbands words to give me a break from him and his sisters fighting ect. Is this the way people get treated and degrated by the child protection agency? I was in my opion found guilty before she checked out all of the facts. I have raised my children for the past 13 years on my own they are healthy, and do well. As any family has there times when things get out of routine and conflicts arise. In effect I have never been so humilated and intimidated by some one who was suppose to be there of the part of the well fare of our children. She is a discrace to the child protection agency and should not be allowed to work in this position. It is not her place to tell who is and who is unfit she is to take her notes and write her opions to her suppervisor. Not give professional advice as to wheather I am an unstable person, And a threat to my children. then tell me she would be back to take them. Please give me some sort of advise at to how I handle this and with whom I do this with.

We were in your office a year ago tomorrow sharing our Family Table Time tool.   As you can imagine the process has been a enormous test of patience and staying positive...but we know we have something that can help so many families!

We would love to share our idea for the Florida military families, Family Table Time and Kraft. (Last year you mentioned you had a contact at Kraft that would like Family Table Time.)  Gov, getting these kits into the homes of the military families is the right thing to do!

Thanks for getting back to me over the weekend about the shuttle tragedy.
 
Today, we are following up on a few things:
 
 
To what extent are you talking with NASA, the White House, Florida's congressional delegation, etc? I understand the President will be speaking with Sean O'Keefe today. Will your brother be briefing you afterward?
 
Also, why isn't there already a statewide report/study on Florida's space industry? Did cuts to Florida Space Authority hamper its ability to make that information available to you?
 
What is the timetable for your briefings with Mr. Gormel, Pam Dana and others?
 
Finally, will you be declaring a state of emergency, issuing any executive orders or offering economic development grants to help boost the Spacecoast workforce and its economy while the shuttle program is in limbo? What else, if anything, can you/Florida do to help out?

Governor Jeb Bush

Dear Governor Bush,

The Coalition of McKay Scholarship Schools is a coalition of over 150 schools in Florida who accept children with disabilities under the McKay Scholarship Program. We have formed this coalition to share information which would strengthen the viability of the McKay Scholarship program for our students.

As a Governor who supports innovations in education, your development of this program is not only changing the lives of children and families in Florida, but this program is being looked upon as a national model. Dr. Patricia K. Hardman of Dyslexia Research Institute has been invited by The Cato Institute in Washington, DC to discuss the potentials this program has for the nation’s children with disabilities. What a legacy to leave as a governor!

However, some in the DOE state bureaucracy have been engaged in trying to derail this program since it began. From the trenches of your voters, we want to apprise you of this bureaucratic sabotage.

Last summer, after replacing some of the key people in the Choice Office who were strongly behind the choice programs, polices began to come from the DOE which could adversely affect the McKay Scholarship Program. A number of schools and organizations questioned how DOE could change rules at such a late date without consultation or consideration of the private schools. The Choice Office arranged a meeting in September between private school representatives, legislative legal aids, Shan Goff’s office and others.

We were assured by Dr. J.C. Bowman that the McKay Scholarship Program was not under the ESE Department but only answered to the Secretary of Education and to you. We were assured that an advisory board of private schools would be formed that would look at any future policies so that decisions could be made with both the bureaucracy and the private schools giving input.

On October 3 the Dyslexia Research Institute held a one day conference inviting schools participating in the McKay Scholarship Program and the Choice Office to meet and discuss how to make this program viable for Florida citizens. Even with less than a month’s notice of the meeting, sixty-six schools were represented at the conference. Dr. Bob Metty of the Choice Office answered many questions for the participants. He again assured us that an advisory board would be formed to make sure that the misunderstandings of the summer would be circumvented in the future.

On October 4 we had several more questions which had arisen at the meeting. These were legitimate questions about federal funding. We sent these questions to Dr. Metty and Dr. Bowman. They said they would respond promptly. After repeated calls and e-mails, on December 3rd, Dr. Metty sent us a draft of the answers to these questions but said that they were in Shan Goff’s office (ESE office) waiting approval. At this date these answers have obviously not been approved by Shan Goff for we have not received them. 

The Coalition questions Dr. Bowman’s assurance that the Choice Office does not answer to anyone but the Secretary when he has to have Shan Goff’s Office "approving" answers from his office.

No advisory council has been organized, although this is "in the works". Words that have been used since September 2002. Is this phrase bureaucrateeze for delaying action?

This fall another policy concerning "inactive versus active IEP’s" came out of DOE, again without input from the private partners. A decision coming from (we were told the ESE office) was made which could deny children their McKay Scholarship if the Districts decided to interpret the policy to their, not the children’s, benefit. We contacted Wayne Pierson from whom, along with Shan Goff, this decision supposedly came. He explained that this had been a specific case decision and was not supposed to be a broad policy. However, we have not been able to have The Choice Office, Shan Goff’s Office, or Wayne Pierson draft a policy correcting this bureaucratic "misunderstanding" and send it to the Districts and to the private schools.

Finally, we are very concerned about the rumblings of behind doors meetings that indicate that Shan Goff’s staff, with certain districts, are writing legislation to "regulate the private schools." Has this been directed by your office? 

Florida’s private schools’ system strength has been that it is not "regulated" by the government but that it has given parents a choice in how they wish their children to be educated. For the first time in U.S. history, parents of disabled students have a choice as to how to educate their children. (They had no choice before and were in a public system where 76 percent of learning disabled students either dropped out or did not receive a standard diploma.) 

If the DOE seeks to "regulate" schools accepting students who receive McKay Scholarship, this will be the bureaucratic way of destroying the program, for the majority of the private schools do not "need" to take these children. They will refuse to accept the McKay Scholarship.

The Coalition’s questions, Governor Bush, are:

    Who is running the Choice Office? Shan Goff or the Choice Director?

    Where is the "partnership" between the private schools and the bureaucracy?

    Are your DOE representatives carrying out your wishes and goals or are they                     undercutting you and launching a bureaucratic initiative themselves to bring education         back to the status quo?

The Coalition would like answers to our questions not bureaucrateeze that "It’s in the works." "It’s waiting to be approved." "We’ll get back to you on this."

Please help us find some cooperation and a partnership attitude within DOE to strengthen the McKay Scholarship program and guarantee your legacy of establishing a true positive choice for parents of children with disabilities.

 

Sincerely,

 

Robyn A. Rennick, MS

President, The Coalition of McKay Scholarship Schools

JANUARY NEWSLETTER

Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) Announces New Head of its 
Developmental Disabilities Program 

DCF recently announced the appointment of Michelle Brantley to the position 
of Director of Developmental Disabilities.  Ms. Brantley is currently Bureau 
Chief for the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA).  She will 
begin her position February 3, 2003.


President Proposes New Funds to Encourage States 
to Assist People with Disabilities in Institutions to 
Transition to the Community of Their Choice

In late January, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) 
announced that President Bush will propose a new $1.75 billion dollar 
five-year demonstration program to assist people with disabilities living in 
institutions to transition to communities of their choice.  The program is 
one of several included in the President's FY 2004 budget aimed at 
implementing the Supreme Court's Olmstead decision through the New Freedom 
Initiative (NFI).  The goal of NFI is to promote full participation of people 
with disabilities in all areas of society.  

This five-year demonstration would assist states in developing and 
implementing a strategy to "re-balance" their long-term care systems so there 
are more
cost-effective choices between institutional and community options,  
including financing Medicaid services for individuals who transition from  
institutions to the community.  

Titled, "Money Follows the Individual Rebalancing Demonstration," the plan 
would permit the funds supporting the person in the institution to "follow 
the individual." This means that when an individual in a nursing home or 
other institution chooses to leave that facility, the funds necessary to 
support the individual's service needs in the community would be transferred 
from the institution's budget to the community.  
   
As an added incentive for states to move people from institutional settings, 
federal grant funds would pay the FULL cost of home and community-based 
waiver services for one year, after which the participating states would 
agree to continue community services at the regular Medicaid matching rate.  

The New Freedom Initiative Demonstrations in the President's spending plan 
would include $220 million over five years, with $11 million proposed for FY 
2004.  This initiative would fund four demonstrations that promote home and 
community-based alternatives.  Two of the demonstrations would provide 
respite care services for caregivers of adults with disabilities or long-term 
illness and children with substantial disabilities.  Another demonstration 
would provide community-based care alternatives for children who are 
currently residing in psychiatric residential treatment facilities.

HHS Secretary Tommy G. Thompson said, "The President and I are committed to 
changing policies that unnecessarily confine people with disabilities in 
institutional settings. We want to work with the states and the disability 
community to change old programs and develop new ones that will serve people 
with disabilities in the settings that work best for them."  

Even though this new federal demonstration money may be available in October 
2003, disability advocacy groups are recommending that interested persons 
begin pressuring their Medicaid Directors (Florida's AHCA Director) and state 
legislatures to begin now to develop a Texas like "money follow the 
individual" program so their states are ready when the new funds become 
available.  For more information see:  www.NFI@WhiteHouse.Gov

Florida Submits an Amendment to the 
Consumer Directed Care Research and Demonstration Waiver 
that will Permit More Floridians 
with Developmental Disabilities to "Cash Out" Services

In early December, the Florida Department of Children and Family Services 
submitted for approval to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services (CMS) an amendment to the Consumer Directed Care (CDC) Research and 
Demonstration waiver.  If approved, this amendment will permit persons 
receiving services from three state agencies, including the Department of 
Children and Family Services' Developmental Disabilities Program, to "cash 
out" services on their current care plans and receive a monthly benefit 
amount to purchase services directly from a provider of their choice.   

The new program will mirror the current Consumer Directed Care Program with 
the following changes:
1.  Individuals can participate without randomization;
2.  The project will be available statewide to a specified number of elders, 
children and adults with developmental disabilities, and adults with physical 
disabilities;
3.  Workers must have background screenings completed prior to being 
employed; and
4.  Program participants will be required to use the fiscal intermediary.

Individuals will have the ability to "cash out" certain Medicaid state plan 
services under the Developmental Services Waiver.  Waiver services will 
include, but 
are not limited to:  homemaker services, personal care services, respite
care services, transportation, supported employment, and adult dental.

If this amendment is approved, participants will include 2,856 consumers 
participating in the current CDC waiver (experimental and control group 
members), 137 who participated in the Developmental Services Choice and 
Control Project, and 357 additional individuals participating in the 
Aged/Disabled or Traumatic Brain Injury/Spinal Cord Injury Home and Community 
Based Services Waiver.  Total program participants will equal 3,350. Florida 
has requested an April 1, 2003 effective date, but there are no time frames 
for federal approval.  


Proposed Florida Zoning Change Would Allow Discrimination 
Against People with Disabilities

Florida State Senator Anna Cowin (R-Leesburg) recently filed Senate Bill 178 
for the 2003 Legislative Session.  The proposed language would amend Section 
419.001(2), Florida Statutes, by NOT allowing community residential homes of 
six or fewer residents (i.e., people who are frail elderly, physically 
disabled, developmentally disabled, mentally ill, or children) to be sited 
within 500 feet from another single family home. 

Current law permits group homes of six or fewer to automatically be 
considered a single family home for the purposes of local zoning. This bill 
would prohibit a group home, which is considered a single-family home, to be 
located within 500 feet proximity of another single family home.  

Changing the current law would make it very difficult for people with 
disabilities who live in a home with six or fewer people with disabilities to 
move into a regular neighborhood.

At this time there is no House companion bill; however, Senate Bill 178 has 
been referred to its committees including Senate Comprehensive Planning, 
Children and Families, Subcommittee on Health and Human Services 
Appropriations and Appropriations. 

We urge you to contact Senator Cowin and the other senators who serve on the 
Comprehensive Planning Committee by phone, email or mail.  Let them know that 
this bill would hurt people with disabilities by discriminating against them 
and limiting where they could live. If you have any questions or need 
additional information, please contact Summer Pfeiffer at the Florida 
Developmental Disabilities Council, Inc., (850) 922-6709.

ADAPT "Free Our People March" - September 4-17, 2003

ADAPT will be going on a 140 mile "Free Our People March" (from the Liberty 
Bell to Capitol Hill) this September 4-17 in a strident effort to garner 
attention and to get MiCASSA passed this year. Because of the institutional 
bias in Medicaid, people with disabilities have been denied their choice to 
live in the community. ADAPT will lead up to the September march with its 
"Stolen Lives" action, May 10-15 in Washington, D.C. To ensure those who are 
not able to attend are represented at the march, ADAPT is asking for pictures 
of people who currently live in nursing homes and other institutions and 
those who were formerly institutionalized against their will.  The pictures 
should be accompanied by a thumbnail sketch of the person in the photo and 
permission from the individual or his/her guardian to use the photo.  The 
photos will be included in a large collage and if enough money is raised, 
they will be put on T-shirts and buttons.  For more information on the Free 
Our People March, go to: www.FreeOurPeople.org.  If you are able to collect 
such photos and stories, please send them digitally by email or by regular

Subject:	Youth jobs for younger responsible workers

Jeb:
In extension of my earlier email regarding lowering the age limit for
work, I wanted to let you know I have been brainstorming the possibility.
It seems to me the sorts of jobs better geared toward younger people
would be on an hour to two hour basis at after school programs as tutors,
and activities coordinators. This would also provide for appropriate
supervision of our youth. Those who 'don't cut the mustard' so to speak
would be ineligible. This age group is a great resource of help.  Many
adults don't find one or two hours a day enough work to make it worth
their while. We could offer the small business owner of afterschool and
day-care programs a tax-exemption for utilizing youth ages 13-15. I'm
probably showing my ignorance where labor policy is concerned, but it
seems to me reform is necessary in many areas of government.

GOVERNOR BUSH STRESSES DIVERSIFICATION THAT WILL  
 STRENGTHEN FLORIDA'S ECONOMY 
  
        TALLAHASSEE - Meeting with the Enterprise Florida Board of 
Directors, Governor Jeb Bush today laid out a cornerstone of his plan to 
diversify Florida's economy - a priority of the Governor's during his second 
term in office.  The Governor, who is Chairman of the Enterprise Florida 
Board, called on the group to join him in taking a focused, ownership role 
in guaranteeing a team approach to further the state's economic development 
efforts. 
  
        "During these tough economic times, Florida has been fortunate that 
we've been able to create new jobs and we've remained fiscally sound," said 
Governor Bush.  "We can and must do better to guarantee a brighter outlook 
for Florida.  One of my top priorities is the diversification of our job 
market.  Accomplishing this goal will require a team effort.  I have raised 
the level of my commitment.  I will call five chief executive officers of 
corporations every week to encourage them to invest or expand in Florida, or 
just merely to thank them for their presence here."  
  
        During the transition from the first to second Bush Administration, 
the Economic Development Transition Team made several recommendations to the 
Governor including continued reliance on the Enterprise Florida 
public-private partnership.  The Governor has also decided to retain all 
economic development programs under his Office of Tourism, Trade, and 
Economic Development.  In addition, Governor Bush has accepted a 
recommendation by Enterprise Florida and the Transition Team to step up the 
statewide strategic planning process to place a higher profile on economic 
diversification.  Because of the importance of workforce development and 
growth management to economic development, the Governor has designated 
Secretary Susan Pareigis of the Agency for Workforce Innovation and incoming 
Secretary of State and Community Partnerships, Glenda Hood, to co-chair the 
statewide strategic plan along with Enterprise Florida President and CEO 
Darrell Kelley.  
  
        The Governor will also focus on growing the unique strength 
industries including international trade, space and defense, and building 
upon emerging technologies.  He laid out four priorities that have the 
potential to create greater economic diversity for Florida:  
  
        *        Securing Miami as the Permanent Secretariat for the Free 
Trade Area of the Americas, which will create an era of prosperity to the 
region and our state.  The Governor recently appointed former Ambassador 
Charles Cobb to head-up the state effort.

        *        Protecting Florida's military bases from the next round of 
base closures scheduled for 2005.  Governor Bush will soon announce a 
leadership team assigned to protect our military bases and defense industry. 

  
        *        Continued commitment to creating the Centers of Excellence 
proposed last year by Governor Bush.  The Florida Board of Education will 
give final approval for the $30 million program next month.  The Centers of 
Excellence will create research cores and build commercial clusters around 
them. 
         
                 
                 "We have a remarkable business climate in Florida.  In 
December, our state created nearly 62,000 new jobs compared to a year ago. 
We can do better.  And we will, working together as a team," Governor Bush 
noted.

Governor, I worked with Sen. McKay in 2001 to get the faith-based funding
for corrections. I have been going into Prisons for over 20 years with the
Bill Glass team out of Dallas. Your brother is very familiar with Bill and
actually has his picture and an endorsement in their literature. Because of
this experience I believe that there are several things I have learned that
give me some insight. I am not a corrections professional, not do I claim to
have their knowledge. Mine is common sense. Florida is typical of all the
other states in the inmate profile. You find that a large majority of the
people in prison are there because basic lifestyle choices. Most of these
choices stem from the breakdown of the family and the moral fiber that made
this country great. Enough of that , you know that.  We put people in
prisons that are often nothing more that holding pens and one day we say
"Time's UP" and we walk them to the door and leave them standing on a street
corner.

We could convert some of our facilities for people who prove they want a
better way and want to get out of the system.  The large majority of these
people are there because of alcohol, drugs or drug related crimes.  We need
to focus on treatment and  spend our money where it will work best. I
believe you left that funding in place but I propose to isolate these people
from those who frankly don't care and want to pull down those who do.  The
faith-based dorms were a good start.

This years budget preserved the faith based dorms but cuts the faith based
after-care facilities; there are essential to the elimination of the return
offender.  The department had funded 58 transitional assistant specialist to
help these people find the facility for them and that cost was very high and
quite frankly added another level of bureaucracy. The Chaplains and the
classifications people can place the offenders in these facility.  We were
funding 400 faith based after care beds. Please see if this can be restored.

I know you face a terrible challenge this year in funding, I am praying for
you and those who will make the decisions that must be made.

Dear Governor Jeb:
 
The following represents a copy of my presentation to the Hillsborough County Legislative Delegation Friday, 1/31/03.
 
I am happy to advise you that it was well received.
 
Ralph.
 
 
PRESENTATION
HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY LEGISLATIVE DELEGATION
UNIVERSITY AREA COMMUNITY CENTER
FRIDAY – JANUARY 31, 2003 – 9:00 A.M.
 
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
 
Ralph Hughes – Tampa.
 
Let there be no doubt in anyone’s mind that we can comply with Amendment 9 --- at zero cost --- and --- enhance the quality of our children’s education at the same time.
 
We can accomplish this by taking action to:
 
(1)               Expand Our Voucher System To Include Home Schooling.
 
The number one problem we face in terms of providing a quality education for our children is a lack of parental involvement.  Home Schooling solves that problem.  Further, it negates the need for classroom space or a teacher.  
 
Literally, millions of students are Home Schooled throughout our nation --- including several thousand in Hillsborough County --- and it is interesting to note that Home Schooled students consistently score higher on college entrance exams than students from our public school system.
 
The business community offers courses, books, etc. to parents that Home School their children.
 
Parents have opted for Home Schooling for various reasons.  The latest reason is fear of physical harm that may be inflicted on their children in our public school system.
 
Let’s go back to parental involvement for a second.  Let’s say we provide a $5000 voucher per child to parents.  What happens?  (1) The cost is virtually ½ of the cost in our public school system and (2) Mama --- or Papa --- as the case may be --- would not have to work outside the home leaving the children to fend for themselves --- particularly if there are 2 or more children in the family.
 
Wouldn’t that be great?  Wouldn’t that go a long way toward restoring family values and family life as it was when we grew up?
 
(2)               Mandate Year-Round Schools.
 
We can increase the number of classrooms and teachers in our state by 33?% by a stroke of the pen by mandating Year-Round Schools. Our schools would then be utilized 240 days per year instead of 180.  Students would continue to attend school for 180 days under a multitrack system wherein the student would attend school for 60 days followed by 20 days vacation.  Teachers would be offered year-round employment enabling their salary to be increased from approximately $39,000 per year to approximately $52,000 per year --- and at lower overall cost than hiring 33?% more teachers.
 
I am providing you today with information pertaining to Year-Round Schools and Home Schooling (hold up package).  I believe you will find this information to be very interesting and informative.  I also believe it will cause you to agree to support our goal and objective in this regard --- and when I say our I am referring to a select committee of the  executive committee members of Florida TaxWatch.  Our President, Dominic Calabro has labeled this committee our A-team.
 
One final comment.
 
The State of Iowa spends virtually the same dollars our state spends annually per student.  However, Iowa ranks number one in our nation in student academic achievement.  Proof positive you cannot solve a quality of education problem by throwing more money at it.
 
Thank you.

Dear Governor Bush,
     My name is Tom Hanlon and I am a senior assistant public defender for the Sixth Judicial Circuit. I am writing in support of the Honorable Craig Villanti whose name is one of those submitted to you for one of the openings on the Second District Court of appeals.  Judge Villanti has very good  work ethic and his character is beyond reproach.  Judge Villanti has a good understanding of the law and would make a fine appellate judge.  I don't think that Judge Villanti would ever do anything that would embarrass you and would make you proud.
     My first job out of law school was clerking for the second district court of appeal and I think I am familiar with the job and it's demands.  I would urge you to favorably consider Judge Villanti for the position.
     Selection of Judge Villanti would also be the first Pasco County judge to sit on the appellate court and therefore his selection would be important to the county as a whole.

Dear Gov. Bush,

My son, Jordan Howard,  has written you many times asking for a visit to his school.  You have been very gracious with your replies, but he still wishes desperately for that visit and an opportunity to talk with you. 

If a school visit is not a possibility, would you consider him visiting you in Tallahassee?

Jordan is a 4th grader at Sabal Point Elementary in Longwood.

Thanks,

Lisa Howard

Dear Governor Bush,
 
Thank you for responding to my email. 
 
I contacted Florida Kidcare this morning and they have informed me that they are processing the application, however; my youngest daughter of 10 months would not qualify and would have to be considered Medicaid because of her age and that they will forward this information  to their office upon completion which will take 4-6 weeks and Medicaid will take 6-8 weeks to process to even determine if she qualifies.
 
I spoke with a gentleman at the Medicare hotline, which Florida Kidcare provided, he surely made one feel like a second class citizen.  
 
Mr. Bush, I am so embarrassed to be put in this position, but time is of the essence with the medical care of my daughter so that she will not have to face surgery, otherwise my children are healthy and vibrant.
 
I am still continuing my pursuit with the Lee County Government as I applied for 3 new positions today that just became vacant.  
 
Thank you for your intervention and understanding concerning this distressing matter.
 
Respectfully,

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am writing this letter seeking assistance from you and/or your staff.  I have been a full time viable resident of Florida for 18 years and have never sought any public assistance.  As of December 1st, I had no alternative than to file for Unemployment and have been actively pursuing a career in the Lee County Government or the State of Florida to provide the insurance benefits my family needs.
 
I have made application recently with the Florida Kidcare and Florida Healthy Kid program as I can no longer afford $453.00 per month for insurance coverage for my 2 girls.  I contacted the Kidcare program this morning only to find that they have not processed my application, however I was informed that because I have insurance in place at the time of application I would not qualify.  I informed them that I have to cancel the insurance at the end of this month rather than the end of March as indicated on the application.   I cannot be 6-8 weeks without any insurance to find out if I qualify or not.  Nor can I  keep my existing insurance if my family would like to eat!
 
I have exhausted my savings prior to filing for Unemployment as I was "too proud" to do so and with the bills piling up rapidly I had no other choice.  
 
I will continue to seek employment with the State of Florida, Lee County Government and larger civilian sector companies so that I will have the benefits that should be afforded to all Americans.
 
I now ask for intervention from you and/or your staff so that I may have my insurance for my children during this transition period.
 
Your consideration concerning this matter is greatly appreciated.

Jeb: I know that you are considering appointments for the Childrens Trust down here. I want to recommend very enthusiastically, Retired Circuit Judge Steven Robinson.
 
    I have known him  Judge Robinson since he was in private practice. I have followed his career and can tell you that his service as a judge has demonstrated compassion, guts, judicial temperament, and talent with few equals. In addition, his qualities as man are remarkable. He has a heart that is large and ever-expanding. He has an intellect which is remarkable. 
 
    His last assignments were on the Juvenile Division, where as you know, I have a booming pro bono practice. Judge Robinson was simply the best. He balanced care and responsibility in a fashion that is unparalleled.
 
    He is a man of independent wealth, who will dedicate his full time to this effort. It is a critical one. The longer I spend on these issues, the more fulfilled I feel, but the more I believe that so much has to be done, and every opportunity that we miss, is a possible life tumbling out of control and taking generations that follow it along for the bad ride down.
 
     With Judge Robinson working on this project, we will have the best of the best dedicating full time to the most important issue that faces us. I ask you to specially consider his appointment. I look forward to having a man of his calibre, temperment, and values dealing with the future of those of our children who have the least and who are therefore the most important investment for society to make Joe  PS I ma available fr shameless personal lobbying at the drop of a hat on this topic.

My good friend and business associate, Dick Corbett has applied to be a

a
large farm in north Florida for several generations.  He's an active
sportsman who is very interested in the well being of Florida wildlife
and
its environment.  I think he'd make a great member of this very
important
commission in that he could represent people actively involved in proper
management of land for the benefit of Florida wildlife.

Dick is also an active diver and fisherman and is concerned about the
environment.  Thank you for your consideration of his application.

Charm and Jim,

Please allow me to provide some clarification regarding the personal care
assistance policy.   On page 2-50 of the new handbook, the policy states
under special considerations: " Personal care assistance in family home
should be provided only to assist the parent or primary caregiver of
children in meeting the personal care needs of the child."  The policy
special considerations also include, but are limited to,"the number of
other beneficiaries the parent or caregiver is attempting to provide
assistance to; the gender of the beneficiary compared to that of the parent
or caregiver; and the complexity of the beneficiary's personal care
routine. The policy does not state that the parent or primary of caregiver
must be present  when the personal care services are being provided.
However, it is important that the provision of  PCA meets its intended
purpose as described in the federally approved waiver and the new handbook.
The approved handbook service description and intended purpose of personal
care assistance is 'to assist a beneficiary with eating and meal
preparation, bathing , dressing , personal hygiene, and activities of daily
living. The service also includes actitivties such as assistance with meal
preparation, bed making and vacuuming when these activities are essential
to the health and welfare of the beneficiary and when no one else is
available to perform them. This service is provided on a one on one basis."

Based on the limited information provided in the e-mail below, it appears
the mothers needs personal care assistance with her 2 sons to help get them
ready for school.  (It is not clear if they are both disabled and/or
enrolled in the DS waiver.)  Assuming the personal care assistance
requested by the mother for her 2 sons is determined medically necessary
and meets the intended purpose of the PCA service (assistance with bathing,
dressing, grooming  as described in policy) it should be allowable in these
circumstances.

I hope this helps to clarify the policy. Please let me know if I can be of
further assistance.

Thanks for the info Wanda.

I will be happy to assist in any way I can.

* What do I tell families that work and their school's program is filled to
capacity?

* What do families do who work and the school programs are not available,
such as during the summer, winter break, spring break etc?.

Of course I will help families identify other resources, but if we come up
empty handed, what service do we identify as a choice to help keep our
developmentally disabled child safely supported in the community and with
their family?

Charm- I just want to add my 2 cents to this.. Our written instruction
from Tally was that the new Rule/handbook was effective 10 /27/02 and that
service limits identified were effective from that date forward AND that we
should be reviewing cost plans in accordance with the handbook limitations
from November 4, 2002 forward( that's the date we rec'd our training on the
handbook).. This was in the 1/8/03 memo from Susan Dickerson that was
distributed at the regional provider meeting last week. This same memo has
been given to support coordination providers. Hopefully, you can assist by
informing families of the change so it will not come as such a total shock
! thanks.

Hi Jim,

Thanks for letting me know about this.  I'll let you know what I find out.
When is your support plan due?  It seems like Wanda is saying that the new
rule will take effect when support plans are due.   Does your child's
school
have a  before and after school care program that provides quality care for
your developmentally disabled loved one?

We did make a recommendation to the DRAFT Coverage and Limitations Handbook
PCA definition under Special Considerations.  Our recommendation was at the
time to delete entire paragraph on page 2-60 of the Draft.  The
justification was that the service should be available to all who qualify
for HCBS Medicaid Waiver Services and support should be based on need and
complexity of the individual's need from age 3 and up and that there is no
requirement for parents to be present.

Many of our recommendations were adopted.

This recommendation was not.

The link for the new Coverage and limitations handbook is:

http://fccflorida.org/bknews/DS_Waiver_Handbook_Jul02.pdf

I think the section they are referring to is in the Special Considerations
section,  page 2-50.  ..."only to assist the parent or primary caregiver of
children in meeting the personal care needs of the child".

Hope this helps.  I'll let you know if I find out anything else.  Keep me
posted.

Charm

WSC is Waiver Support Coordinator.  The new handbook says that Personal
care
assistance in the family home should be provided only to assist the parent
or primary caregiver of children in meeting the personal care needs of the
child.  They pointed this out at the provider's meeting on Thursday and at

So, while I am not planning on leaving my beautiful house up here in Virginia, if a house were to come up in my old neighborhood in Tallahassee, I might buy a second home and become a snowbird.  If I do, I'll be sure to visit.  Hope you're doing well,

Dear Governor Bush,

Just f y i, Bishop Ricard and the Catholic Charities Directors from the seven dioceses were in our office this afternoon and I invited Secy Regier over to share his vision and allow them to talk about ways they could assist him in it.   It was a very good session.  Main discussion centered on Foster Care, especially recruitment, the reimbursement process, family support services generally, and sovereign immunity.  We felt very good about the exchange and I think he did, too.  We will look for ways to follow-up with him.

In another matter, Jeb, please ask your folks to remember to invite the other nonpublic school reps (FAANS) and us to the table when ideas are being considered for Corporate Tax Scholarship and other scholarship legislation.   There is some angst among some of the stakeholders out there over the concern that they won't be able to help build these proposals, and instead be in a position to only react to them.  Your steering help here will be appreciated.

We have confirmed with your schedulers the breakfast with the Bishops at your place on Wednesday, March 26.  Separately a letter is coming to you asking if you will serve as a reader at the Red Mass on March 25.  Hope it will work for you.   

Lead on, Governor.

Dear Jeb:
I've never been so disappointed in a person in my life as I am with you right now. You know how I feel about Crosby and to get that letter from him covering up everything as usual just like he covered up and planned Valdez murder is appalling to me. Kevin has messed up since he's been in prison yes but a majority of his disciplinary reports were lies and I intend to prove that if its the last thing I do. You know yourself that the ones at Washington were retaliation because I told on Warden Alford not only what he did to Kevin but other inmates as well for years. As for the lewd charges they definitely were bold face lies the one at Desoto Kevin was in protective custody behind a solid steel door and the female officer was fifty feet away in a tower, this officer from what I have been told but of course no one at DOC will verify this when I have asked has been fired for having sex with the inmates and I'm sure with the one Kevin was in protective custody from that was trying to extort money from me not to rape and kill Kevin and I went straight to the prison when this happened. But I've told you about these incidents several times already so you know the truth. And you know me if I thought for one-second Kevin was guilty I would not be fighting so hard to get to the truth. Mr. Crosby or his staff member one is a liar but we know Crosby is already said Kevin refused protection funny thing I received a letter today saying the staff member tried to get him to sign a waiver that he didn't want protection and Kevin refused and said he wanted protection from the crooked officers that lied and set him up with the bogus DR's. So did Crosby want Kevin to sign that so he could start planning his murder and pick a new goon squad to carry it out for him like before. I know there are still some of his good ole boy bunch there. And how dare him talk about what Kevin's done with what he's done but like I said the truth about him is about to come out big time so stand bye. I've always respected your judgment but this time your way off. I want the staff member that lied about what Kevin said and the bogus DR's overturned so Kevin can do his last few months in peace. Please promise me you want let Crosby and his goons kill my baby Please. Also tell Uncle Festor to stop using Michael Moore's old opening line about how hard it is when you have a loved one incarcerated line I hated it when he used it and I hate it now.

                                                                          Thank You

Gov,
Another suggestion for you. This time for LG. And I haven't had any
conversations with this person either.  I was thinking about the many ways
the current LG compliments you.  I was thinking about people that I know who
could perform some of the roles the current LG fills.  Someone who doesn't
have any aspirations to be the next Governor.  Someone, who's appointment
would make history and reinforce your commitment to hire/appointment
qualified minorities to your administration.  I think Ruben King-Shaw fits
the bill.  He's equally as outgoing and gregarious as the current LG.  He's
a dynamic public speaker (not quite as good as Frank, but never the less,
damn good).  He knows his way around the Tallahassee bureaucracy, and now
the Washington bureaucracy.  He's a double minority—African American and
Hispanic. He doesn't have any political ambitions, so you won't piss off any
of the potential 2006 candidates for Governor (or they'll be equally
pissed).  His wife, Pat, loves Tallahassee.  I know it would be a huge
sacrifice for him to come back to Tallahassee, but knowing Ruben, he would
do it for you.

My 2 cents.

>Since May 2000, the political stalemate in Haiti has had an increasingly disastrous effect on the country's economy and overall stability. Those most affected by this crisis are Haiti's eight million citizens, an already vulnerable population. The Organization of American States (OAS) has led an international effort to broker a political accord between the government and the opposition. How have other institutions inside and outside of Haiti been supporting the country and its citizens during this period and what particular challenges do they face? Moreover, once the immediate crisis is resolved, what steps can be taken to put Haiti on course for growth and development?

>Distinguished panelists from the private and public sectors will address these issues, among others. Please see the attached agenda for a complete list of panels and panelists.

Hello Governor:
    I am writing to say thanks for calling me when I was in the hospital. I am making a miraculous recovery. Even in my time of illness, I have tried my best to support you by writing, and encouraging others to tell, the truth about your efforts as chief agency head. I do not know if you have been made aware regrading things I have done on your behalf.
     I want you to know that I need employment. I feel I'll be able to work in about three or four weeks. If  it is inappropriate or undesirable for you and I to work together.I pray that you can recommend me for a position with your brother, his campaign, the state GOP or some other agency in the state of Florida. I need work to pay for my necessary medication.
     Plus, my book will be available to the public next week and you and I are pictured on the cover.You also received recognition in the book.
     I really appreciate the kindness you've shown and the help you've given. I still need your assistance. We still need each other.

Thought you would be interested to know that my testing calendar list 3 separate tests in the next month
 
A week from Tuesday is Florida writes.  March 7-9 is FCAT Math/reading and March 12th is the NRT.  Remember in December, we discussed our understanding that the NRT was embedded in FCAT.  This year for 3,4,5,6 graders in Leon County they are completely different tests at different times.

Question:  is NRT being given in isolation all over the state or has LCS added their own NRT.  If the state has changed it, why? More convenient for the state?---I believe it is far less convenient for students/schools.  
 
You might consider a round table with school test coordinators.  The rules/regulations/preparations are massive for each testing.  I am very surprised at what I see in the real world VS what we were told at the briefings in your conference room.

I am just curious if you are familiar with a relatively new technique to restore lost beaches and prevent future erosion (as discussed at the last cabinet meeting regard Broward County's beaches) that is environmentally friendly and a natural method called NuShore?  
 
If not, please go to web site www.beceng.com (Benedict Engineering) and click the tab on the left-hand side called NuShore and read about that.
 
Just a thought that occured to me at the last meeting.

Governor Bush,

Thank you and our First Lady, Columba, very much for opening up your
hearts and home to the African Americans in Florida.  The African
American History Essay Scholarship Contest gets better every year.  This
year was especially wonderful for me.  As pastor of Beulah Hill
Missionary Baptist Church, I challenged our young people to get involved
in the contest.

Ms. Jocelyn Riley, a 10th Grader at Quincy Shanks, wrote a wonderful
essay and is the first student at Beulah Hill to compete.  Thank you for
allowing me the opportunity to invite her and her parents (Johnny and
Cynthia Riley) to the Governor's Mansion on yesterday.  They were able
to see and hear Robert Johnson and his art collection on display.  She
wants to follow her parents, who are graduates of Bethune-Cookman
College, and was delighted to see the president (Dr. Bronson) at he
Mansion.

You have given a brilliant young lady a reinforcement for her quest for
excellence.  Although, she did not win the competition, I am encouraging
her to compete again next year.

Thank you for your leadership, friendship and prayers for our state and
it's diversity.

Your friend and brother in Christ!

Matt

Good Morning Governor:

Not sure if you or any one on your staff can help with this, but please read this information.  I can attest to this type of therapy.  I have a taped session where my therapist did this with my son and I and it would blow you away.  It was awesome.  It's very loving and gentle nothing abusive about it and this child opened his heart and felt love for probably the first time in his life and you could see it on his face.  Maybe you could forward to the President.  

I'm also going to forward a copy to Sharon.

Once again thanks for your help

Take care

Dear Favorite "GUV":

As Chairman of the Flagler County Executive Committe, I ran up the flag
pole of the members at last week's meeting the idea that our hero, Lt.
Com. Jennifer Carroll, would be the greatest addition to the executive
branch should YOU appoint her to succeed our great buddy Frank Brogan as
Lt. Governor of my native State.

The Flagler County folks ,without a single dissent, approved a tentative
resolution to ask you consider this successful, articulate, educated
(good looking)  classy lady  as our next Liutentant Governor to take the
place of the great loveable Frank Brogan.

Just the  o ther day I asked Jennifer Carroll is she is still black. Her
answwer was in the affirmative. I further asked if she was a woman.
Again, an affirmative response.

Gee ... what an asset for the people of Florida ... black and female ...
smart, educated, articulate (a great speaker), 
known already statewide... whow!

Hey ... let's go for her nomination to be 
the unique person she is ... a most acceptable replacement for our great
and good friend, the great Frank Brogan1111

Dear Judy:
Those statistics reflect the disparity and the plight of our Florida's inmates. 

Are you are telling me that 40 facilities out of 121 have any kind of programs at all?  There are 135 vocational programs (probably most of them in youthful Offenders) to provide education, job skills, and no drug programs for 74,000 inmates.  That means that approximately one out of 550 inmates have an opportunity to be in a program, any program, nevertheless a good one with transferable skills.  

1 per 550 inmates? Is that supposed to impress me with how well Florida is doing?

Educational, vocational, and drug programs have been slashed to a bare bone.  Whole educational departments have been eliminated and only librarians are left.  If I'm wrong, tell me where.  I want my statistics to be correct.

Drug programs, have been eliminated.  Where on your list are the drug programs?  Inmates were mandated by the legislature and now they are few and far between.  The prisons are flooded with drugs.  Great quantities have to be coming into our prisons by DOC staff.  Inmates are subject to harsh punishment if they use these ill gotten drugs. The prison staff suffers no consequences of their actions. Instead of drug programs the DOC just locks the inmates up in CM.  It doesn't work.  It isn't effective.  

Florida's prisons are just holding cells for humans. No rehabilitation, just punishment.

Subject:	Still need the unemployment decision override

Dear Governor,
     In a time like this when we have lost our astronauts, I feel much guilt writing to complain about my problems. You do not know me. For some strange reason my whole life has been one of living on the edge-being on the outside looking in, whether it be as a child & not fitting in because I was adopted, or as an adult in prison, spending my evenings sitting by any window I could get to as I have been an amateur astronomer since age 18 (now 51). Carl Sagan was my guide, & my Irish Setter is named Sagan today. I walk the talk of recovery, I am a very spiritual woman who gives empathy to any human regardless of what they have done when they seek knowledge or help to recover from whatever ails them, & no matter where I go, I am ostracized by others for I am real, so I am told by those from the spiritual community. It is kind of like what Jesus went through-I have been loved by many since going into the helping field, but went through hell because of my past while attempting to hold my head high, knowing I was doing the work of God although unable to outwardly state so because of our laws. From the nursing home work which tore me down physically, to being up against persons in high authority in facilities who are afraid of me because they know I stand for TRUTH, I continue to seek work regardless of the obstacles. The problem now is I am under chemotherapy & physically cannot endure much more stress. I asked for your help to get me unemployment, but still the answer has been NO. They say I did not provide all my evidence when I first filed for unemployment. Well, it is kind of like seeking work-I do not tell the potential employer I have Hep C, or a bad back, or fibromyalgia, until I have to, because it is personal information that has a tendency to get out into the public & destroy a persons chance for work, which is exactly what has happened here. I got a job & lasted one day yesterday, at Marion Citrus Mental Health, the local large provider where I did my interning, paying over 2K for such & treated like crap especially by one Islamic manager while a student. He happened to come into the office while I was in orientation yesterday for a finally found job at around 3 PM, then within 15 minutes the speaker excused herself saying there was an emergency, one of a kind of which she had never had happen during an orientation, then by 5 PM as everyone was dismissed for the day, I was called into the office & handed a note rescinding the offer of employment, saying a boundary issue had occurred. I was told I had made derogatory remarks about the job which was an outright lie. I had said nothing but good things, building up the place to the other new hires, as I was so grateful to finally find work with medical benefits. Of course, on my paperwork, I had given them the civil rights restoration papers from your office, which lists all my past convictions. Plus I had honestly filled out the medical background check, of which I had to say I was under chemo for Hep C, plus divulge the herniated disc problems, heart problem, fibromyalgia, and more. But the real truth is that when that department head of one of the substance abuse programs saw me there, he could not believe I was hired, & he went after me, to get me out of there. This is a large facility with several satellite offices around the county. I was going to be working with juveniles in a different location. I had already been interviewed by the manager & hired. I was in orientation. But I had had problems when a student there in 2001, as many many recovering addicts were there in the in patient program similar to the one your daughter is in, & many many people knew me from the recovery community, as this is a small town. I had been treated like a prisoner when I was there, & even the reps from Webster University, where I was a student, had advised me never to go to work there because there was ethical problems. But out of work, out of need, I tried, & lasted one day. This stress while under this chemo is no good Governor. The doctor made me convince him I would not expose myself to undue stress as this medication could cause  a heart attack. Today I am in a lot of pain, & again jobless. Again I write to you asking for you to override the unemployment decision. Please help me before I end up dead.

We work for children and families and earn a very modest income.  The Dept of Education offers teachers a way to work off their loans by working with indigent people.  We work with these people on a daily basis and earn much less than teachers.  Can you see if you can offer us Florida State workers a similar benefit?

Thank you, 
Daisy Berman

Subject: Recommendation for Doug Wallace


Dear Governor Bush:

	I am writing to recommend Douglas Alan Wallace for a position on the Second
District Court of Appeals.  It is my understanding that you will be
interviewing Doug within the week.  I have known Doug for approximately
thirty years and worked with Doug when I practiced law in Bradenton,
Florida.  I have observed Doug’s work over the years and stayed in contact
since my move to Tallahassee.  Doug is one of the most intelligent legal
scholars that I have ever met.  I believe you have interviewed Doug
previously for a position on the Second DCA and I am sure it was apparent to
you at that time how very able and intelligent Doug is.

	Doug personally handled all my firm’s appellate work while I was in
Bradenton.  I believe that his reputation as a lawyer and as an appellate
lawyer speaks for itself.  Doug has considerable courtroom experience as
trial lawyer, which I believe should be a requirement for any judicial
position, as I have advocated to you previously.

	If appropriate, I would urge you to solicit opinions from the current
judges on the Second DCA as to Doug’s ability since he is well-known in that
court and I am sure they will echo my opinion.

	Should you require any other information, please feel free to contact me
but I would strongly urge you to favorably consider Doug Wallace for the
Second District Court of Appeals position.

Sincerely yours,

John

New Port Richey, FL 34652
 
Sunday 2 February 2003 I wrote a letter referencing a fire in the home of Bill and Sandy Faulkner.  Prior to writing this letter I was told by Mr. Faulkner and then again on 1 February 2003 by three firemen on duty at Eastlake Station 56, that they  did not have maps in order to locate the residence which was only two tenths of a mile from the firehouse.
 
Upon these substantiations I took it upon myself as a citizen of Pinellas County to bring this deficiency to the attention of, the public, the county and to the attention of Governor Bush.  Through correspondence from Commissioner Kenneth Welch advising Commission Seel and County Administrator of the need for action. Further, I received correspondence from Mr. Dwaine Booth advising me of the capacities of Pinellas County.
 
In the thought of assisting Eastlake Fire Departing,  to receive equipment and/or maps they needed, I sought out the Chief Parks. It was during that meeting this afternoon I learned that both Mr. Faulkner and myself were mislead by the statements given to both of us in reference to no maps. There are such maps which he produced and displayed to me.
 
Therefore, I request that my letter to the editor be withdrawn from publication..
 
Sincerely,

Bush predicts online version of FCAT 
By Mary Ellen Flannery and Kimberly Miller, Palm Beach Post Staff Writers
Saturday, February 1, 2003
MIAMI -- Gov. Jeb Bush told school principals Friday that some of their students could be taking the FCAT online next year, getting their results almost immediately. 
Bush spoke to about 200 educators from Florida's failing schools, including Palm Beach County's seven, during a daylong conference aimed at improving student success at the state's lowest-performing schools.
After praising principals for their good work this year, Bush answered several questions, including one from Shelley Kelley, a Title I coordinator for Pahokee Middle/Senior High School who was concerned that students and teachers leave for the summer without knowing whether they've earned a better grade on the FCAT.
"To leave without knowing is really anticlimactic," Kelley said. 
Bush agreed, saying that was a "hot-button" issue for him, too, especially this year with the threat of retention for third-graders who fail the FCAT. And for the first time, high school seniors could be denied their diplomas if they don't pass the FCAT. 
This year, third-graders and students taking the graduation test will get their results first, Bush promised.
But grades typically come out in the summer because it takes so long for a private company to produce FCAT results. Unlike other standardized tests, the FCAT includes written responses and short essay-style answers. 
Bush said it wouldn't be a problem in years to come. His solution would be an online version of the FCAT. "We're still stuck in eighth-century technology," Bush said. 
Bush, though, didn't provide any details about how online testing would work or speed up grading. A computerized version of the test has also been promised next year to students with disabilities.
With an online test, "the response time would be almost real time, which is where we need to be," Bush said. "Also, students could take it at the end of the year."
The FCAT is now taken in February and March, a testing period that teachers say doesn't really measure a full year of learning.

I really apologize, tell Columba that I apologize as well. I am just too tired. when I saw the word without the "i" I didn't read the text and realize that it was referring to your wife. I know her name but it just didn't register.

2003 Team Florida Economic Development Series

“Building a World Class Workforce”

February 3, 2003

Dear Florida Legislator:

 

Every survey of companies inside and outside of Florida in the past five years has come to the same conclusion – Workforce is the number one issue in economic development and the growth of companies.  Although cost is a related factor, it is the availability of a skilled workforce that concerns most companies when they expand or start a new operation.  

 

A great workforce begins with a great educational system.  Following formal education is training to establish or enhance skills to adapt to the specific needs of companies.  The next step goes to the continual retraining and enhancing of skills as our economy changes so rapidly based on new technologies.  

 

Rapidly changing skill requirements and the ability of the Florida workforce to stay up with these changes is the key issue facing our competitiveness for the future, and our prosperity.  We must keep learning in order to lead.

 

Good progress has been made and systems are in place but much more is needed for the future.  Strong workforce programs, commitment to a world-class education and a constant connection to the ever expanding needs of business though our workforce programs are critical.

 

What is being done? Economic and workforce development organizations statewide are partnering to:

*	Keep up with and better address the needs of existing and prospective businesses; 

*	Assist Florida businesses in identifying and accessing workforce training funds through local employed worker training programs, Workforce Florida’s Quick Response Training (QRT) and Incumbent Worker Training (IWT) Programs and council initiatives, as well as various federal grant opportunities. 

*	Developing innovative programs and  non- traditional approaches to help people and companies to succeed in higher wage opportunities.

 

What can you do?

*	Strengthen the alignment and funding of workforce and economic development strategies. 

*	Support Florida’s efforts to increase business innovation and entrepreneurship.

*	Support Florida’s efforts to attract new value-added businesses and increase the competitiveness of existing businesses through skills upgrade training of their existing workforce. 

*	Support the establishment of Centers of Excellence and other efforts that provide training in occupations most in demand, or in a targeted industry.

Subject:	Gratitude for not getting that job

To My Governor I Respect With All My Heart,
     I had written a very long letter but rescinded it, knowing you would not understand the terminology I was using, and that it was taking way too much time to explain how Medicare reimburses nursing homes, how the public does not know, nor the Government, what therapists go through to get paid, how we had to manage the time to look right for Medicare, and all that I truly believe you nor anyone up there is aware of.  The boss who ran me off the job is one of the best professional MBA therapist that company could have, for he knows how to convince any Agent of any Agency, that he is right. I never stood a chance to win my unemployment case, but just as those astronauts have met their maker and gone on into eternity I am sure with the Lord, all of us will also meet that same maker someday, and I know where I am going when I leave here. I know in my heart I always treated my patients with respect, I went the extra mile to help those in pain, even when I was in so much pain I could hardly function. The Agency wrote me again & stated I would not receive the unenemployment because I did not tell them everything from the beginning. I did, so that is an outright lie. I even sent them a copy of the write up of allegations and lies concocted by my boss, who harassed me for 2 years, causing me to get sicker as my immune system faltered under all the duress on the job, to try to do things his way, against my moral & ethical beliefs. I never broke the laws & rules, & I, being a licensed therapist, had the right to my own approach with my patients.  Somehow, this guy had a way of approaching patients who had Alzheimers & dementia, & got them to say things bad against me, to build a case, stating he & I could not come to agreement.  He stated I refused to follow his orders.  He singled me out of all the therapists, especially when they found out I got the MA in counseling, & had taken several ethics courses, & began picking on me for the way I worked with people.  I could get dozens of people to the phone for anyone who would call them on my behalf, but most are homebound & there was no way to have them at my hearing. Plus they had nothing to do with my case. I was told I was going to be fired if he & I had any issue, & there was an issue, & the agency telling me I could not get benefits if fired, I went ahead & resigned instead, as my doctor had told me to get out of that business because my spinal disease was deteriorating fast. This last Agency letter states I never requested any means of help on my job to try to benefit me, which is a lie, for I did, & was told there was no light duty, nor any way I could work at a lowered capacity. So I had to resign to save my good name, & start seeking work in the newly degreed field. Now this former boss has been the ruin of my good name, not giving good references, so lately I do not use his name as my former boss. I may today, have found a job at a Juvenile Justice Agency in counseling. So again I thank you for giving my rights back, & I am now going to ask for a full pardon. Still, I need the unemployment compensation to keep from having to go live in my car, as I am now totally broke, having used up my 6 months of savings in the bank. I depended on the compensation, & know the Agency was not fair, considering I had a medical condition that once that knowledge became public, could ruin me from future employment. Plus all this stress they put me under is colliding with the interferon treatment, which requires little or nor undue stress in ones life, else a heart attack could occur. I already have mitral valve prolapse & fibromyalgia, some of which was caused from being in prison when younger and all the stress the inmates cause white women to endure, and early arthritis is very common in former prisoners from the bedding & heavy 100 pound lifting, even when I told them I had early arthritis. Now this stress caused over this unemployment case, according to my doctor, is wrong. I worked hard these years, put in my time, & feel cheated. So once more, I, in the name of Jesus our Lord and Saviour, ask you, to override the Agency decision, and allow me to collect for the weeks not worked since leaving my job at Palm Garden.  I spoke with several professionals and spiritual leaders today, & discovered that it was best I did not get that job I wrote you of yesterday, for I would not not fit it anyplace where unethical practices are going on, as I will the one to be hurt even further.  Also, I implore you to invite me up there when session comes up about the nursing home issues, so I can witness as to what really goes on in those places, a witness for the State, when they start crying poverty, when in fact, they cut corners to the point of hurting people like myself, but first, do no harm to the patients.
    Gratefully, Winnie Buman McDavid  352-347-3822

Jeb -

Doc Dockery called me at home tonight, which is probably the second or third time I have talked to him in the last two years.  He asked me if I had heard anything about you taking some hard, public position against Hihg Speed Rail on February 10.  I said that I had not, but I told him I would ask around to see what I could find out.

I am not asking, but I am reporting that Doc went on to say that, while he loved you, "it would get ugly" if you "crossed him" on High Speed Rail.  He reminded me of his dogged, multi-year Tong War with John Shebel over the AIF self-insurance fund.  I suppose he told me this as an agressive display, much like a bull pawing the dirt before he charges.

I suspect Doc already knows what I do not know about February 10 and actually wanted me to relay a message to you, which I have now done.

OPPAGA REPORT NOT ENTIRELY ACCURATE

I’ve been a state employee for over 20 years.  My first
professional job was an abuse investigator for the
Adult Services Program at the Department of Children &
Families (DCF).  I investigated complaints of adult
abuse, neglect and exploitation in a five county area
for over 5 years.  The reason I left the program was
not for a lack of fulfillment or need—but for a severe
lack of funding for emergency shelter and long term
care facility placement options.

I read the article concerning the recent report filed
by the Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government
Accountability (OPPAGA) on the performance of the Adult
Services Program at DCF.  While the report praised the
agency for beginning 99.2 percent of its investigations
within 24 hours, it also criticized it for completing
“only 65.4 percent of investigations within the 60-day
deadline.”

The OPPAGA report failed to mention one very important
performance indicator.   The backlog of cases at the
Adult Services Program continues to be about 1 percent
of that which is currently in the children’s program. 
This hasn’t changed significantly since I left the
program.  

Furthermore, the report failed to mention that
emergency shelter funds available to investigators is
under $100 for every elder or disabled adult served. 
This critical lack of funding for the program forces
investigators to search for private funds from victims’
families, Medicaid and Medicare, other social service
agencies not funded by the State, and community based
programs which are severely lacking in funding from
donations and grants.

I think OPPAGA should have viewed the fact that
investigators completed over 65 percent of their
investigations in less than 60 days as a positive
rather than a negative, particularly in light of the
lack of long term placement options.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
Since 1966, Citrus County residents have reached deep into their pockets and hearts to help the Key Training Center serve over 1,100 developmentally disabled people.  Originating in 1976, The “Run for the Money” annual fundraising campaign has raised over 2 million dollars and heighten public awareness about the challenges and needs of these precious people.  Last year’s campaign topped over $143,000.  Citrus County is an explicatory example of where concerned citizens, businesses, service providers, and government can work together to meet the needs of this fragile and vulnerable population. 
Each year the Key Center subsidizes nearly 1.5 million dollars to deliver adult day training and residential services through efforts of grants, thrift stores, and community donations.  In addition, sixteen of our consumers are unfunded.  Most of these individuals are on the State’s waiting list for services.  This is only possible through extraordinary community support and the Key Center’s devout belief in God’s love, provision, and blessings for these people.
The Key Training Center would be honored to have you and your wife as our distinguished guests at our 21st Annual Run for the Money Dinner Auction on Friday, July 18, 2003.  Governor your supportive presence at our principal fundraising event would be a great privilege and a praiseworthy award to the loyal advocates and supporters of the Key Training Center’s mission and services. 
Governor we appreciate your passionate voice on behalf of Florida citizens with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities. Understanding you have a busy calendar, we hope your schedule will permit you to spend some time with others that have the same commitment to these special people.  If your time allows, we could also arrange for a tour of our facilities preceding the dinner auction.

Dear Gov. Jeb,
Thanks so much for your letter regarding the Site Selection Committee consideration of a portion of the Guana River State Park. All the St. Johns County School Board members have gotten a copy of it! Susan Van Hoek told me she would burn herself in effigy if they used any part of it for any kind of school. I'll be right there with her as Chairman of the St. Johns County School Board. (Not that we're against education) Thank you, thank you.
 
On another note, Division of Historical Resources sounds like it's in a transition of some sort. Hope it doesn't affect St. Augustine's efforts to maintain itself -- since we can't afford ourselves -- but we bring a lot of tourism into the State. Our new Mayor Gardner is too "touchy feely" to understand that. Could you get Glenda Hood to come visit and see? You and Columba come with her!

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I have just been advised by some political observers in Florida, that you have the name of Ruben King Shaw, Jr. under consideration to be appointed the next Lt. Governor in Florida.
 
If this is true, I would like to tell you that I have had extensive contacts with Mr. King Shaw over the years.  In fact, I have written many unflattering articles about his agency (AHCA) when he was in Tallahassee.
 
Having said that, I think that Mr. King Shaw would make an excellent Lt. Governor.  I never questioned his work ethic nor his ability to get things done.  I questioned many of the decisions made by his agency, by individuals who were carried over from the previous secretary.
 
If Ruben is your choice, his appointment would be welcomed and embraced by Republicans all over the country and by members of the news media.
 
I wish you well in your decision making process.

Governor: I am please to write a strong letter of support for Alan Deserio, whose name is before you for appointment to the Second District Court of Appeal. I strongly encourage you to appoint him. The following are a few of his qualifications:

6. He is an excellent student of the law but I'm sure that could be said of others. What is important about Alan is that he is an excellent lawyer who could be counted on to serve on the bench in a manner that would not disappoint you. If I were in your position and could influence the future of the judiciary I would want a man like Alan to be on the court.  

7. Alan is also a believer in Christ and his political and social philosophies are both consistent with his faith. He graduated from FSU and was admitted to the bar in 1973. He has been nominated for a 2d DCA opening created by Judge Blue’s retirement. 

You and have talked many times about your desire to influence to future of Florida in a positive way by shaping the courts, especially appellate courts, to reflect the beliefs that we hold dear.

Please give Alan strong consideration.

I look forward to seeing you during the session. My two years of retirement are up and I am legal to lobby during the session, which I plan to do.

Beverley joins me in wishing you and your family all the best in this new year.

FLAA COMMENTS ON  GOVERNOR BUSH'S FY 2003-2004 BUDGET  

Tampa, FL - Facing fears of a failing economy, the threat of impending war and the ongoing struggle to balance state budgets, Florida AIDS Action (FLAA) is pleased to acknowledge Governor Jeb Bush's recommendations for HIV/AIDS funding in the proposed FY 2003-2004 Florida State Budget.

Bush pleasantly surprised AIDS advocates by maintaining current funding of HIV/AIDS programs and increasing funds for the AIDS Insurance Continuation Program (AICP) during a time when other states' AIDS programs are seeing budget reductions.

According to Tom Liberti, chief of the Bureau of HIV/AIDS for the Florida Department of Health, "This is definitely encouraging. During a strong economy we'd be advocating for increases across the board. But, at this time, the fact that the Governor's budget doesn't cut HIV/AIDS programs is good news."

The Governor recommended a $6.5 million restoration in the FY 2003-2004 budget for the Medicaid Project AIDS Care Waiver (PAC Waiver) Program, providing care management, adult day care services and meals to persons living with AIDS.

Furthermore, Bush identified a $1,514,880 increase for the AIDS Insurance Continuation Program (AICP) - a life enhancing program that enables persons living with AIDS to remain on their privately held insurance, thus reducing access to more costly government funded programs.

Closing the Gap, a program designed to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the delivery of healthcare, is now slated for $1.75 million in funding, down slightly from the $2 million originally proposed. "The difference is a result of allocating funds to shore-up the AICP last year during a crisis," explains Jesse Fry, FLAA director of Government Affairs. "$250,000 went to ensure that some 1,600 Floridians had access to healthcare coverage."

Additionally, the budget includes the authority to spend $10 million in federal grant funds on the state's AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP), which provides life-saving medication to underinsured and uninsured persons living with AIDS. In Florida, ADAP serves over 13,000 people. 

"This is good news and we commend the Governor for his efforts," comments Dr. Gene Copello, FLAA Executive Director. "But the reality is that the need grows each and every day as medical costs continue to rise and as more people access care and stay in care for longer periods of time. In fact," Copello continues, "unless we see some increases on the federal and state levels, we will be facing an ADAP crisis in Florida. There's still much work to be done to ensure that the needs of 100,000 Floridians living with HIV/AIDS are met. Florida AIDS Action will be advocating with the Governor's Office as well as the Florida Legislature to maintain current HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment funding, as well as to expand it to the highest extent possible based on community needs."

Dear Governor Bush'
 
I am writing you this note to pass my strong recommendation of Ms Irene Guy to be appointed the next Supervisor of Election for Hillsborough
County. I have known Irene for over 10 years both as a business associate at Verizon (formerly GTE) and subsequently in her very active  positive role as a well respected community  leader. Irene is a very intelligent professional who brings significant value to all her activities. She is very trustworthy, sincere, conscientious individual who will continue to bring a high level of integrity to to this office. The fact that Verison is willing to give her
a leave of absence is a tribute to their recognition of her commitment to public service and a recognition of her talent as a community leader.
I strongly recommend her to this office.

Please reconsider your cuts to the Pace School, especially in Orlando.  Building incarceration facilities for our youth is a cowardly approach to our youth crime problem.  Put our money into prevention programs, like the Pace School where we can attempt to solve the problem, not just hide it away in a prison.  Think, Governor, use your position to actually help the people you represent instead of using them as stepping stones for your personal agendas.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

       About noon on February 12th of this year, the birthday of "Honest Abe", if you look out your Capitol windows in the direction of the Supreme Court you will see a gathering of men (and a few wives and widows).  What might be most obvious in your observation is that these men are aged in their 70's and 80's.

       Let me introduce them to you.  They witnessed the bloody wounds of Bob Dole and Dan Inouye in the mountains of Italy.  Charlie Rangel served with them in Korea. In October 1962 President John F. Kennedy mused if his small daughter would see another sunrise. On the East-West German border I was concerned for my infant daughter who was two hours away from a Soviet Tank Army.  These men served in the air with John McCain, on land with Chuck Hagel and on the water with John Kerry.
The service of this group in your sight went beyond one battle or one campaign.  They stayed in uniform for twenty or more years.

       A grateful nation, through the President and you legislators promised all of them lifetime medical care.  Promised in writing (Government Printing Office), promised in decades of oral assurances by recruiters.  Another President with the concurrence of you legislators revoked this promise.  Yet another President who as a campaigner, and in office, repeatedly poclaimed to veterans and to the nation that promises made would be promises kept.  This same President sent his Justice Department lawyers out on a mission to see that the broken promises remained broken.  The men across the street from you ask for the simple justice of fulfilled obligations.  I wonder what Honest Abe would think of this situation.

       There is a large group of retirees in Washington who will not be standing or wheelchaired in front of the Supreme Court.  You need not concern yourself with them   They are all across the river, in crisp military formation, row upon row, in Arlington.

Dear Governor Bush,
I have known Renee Benton in her capacity as Executive Director of the Hillsborough County Work Force Board. Ms Benton has taken an organization that was run ineffectively and is in the process of transforming it into an institution which both the community and you will be proud of. She has initiated a Strategic Planning and management renewal process that would bring in the best of the market and private sector discipline to build a service delivery system which can set the standard for the nation. She is a highly intelligent and very energetic individual that not only understands how to lead but has unique capacity to serve with compassion  and integrity.
 
I think Ms Benton will be an excellent addition to the Expressway Authority Board and I hope you will appoint her to that position.

Dear Governor:

I had an opportunity to talk to John Winn and Kathleen Shanahan
about the College Board filing an amicus brief in support of the University
of Michigan case in front of the Supreme Court.  I very much want to talk to
you personally about this.  Before that conversation, I feel that it would
be helpful for me to review the success of our Florida Partnership within
your remarkable One Florida program. This success has in no way been
marginalized by the College Board's and my historical support of affirmative
action.

I first had the opportunity to meet with you when the College Board's
participation in Florida One was announced at a press conference in
Tallahassee in late 1999.  Before the press announcement, we discussed the
issue of the College Board's and my historical support of affirmative
action.  At that time and again during your election, the difference between
your view and ours was questioned by the press.  In both instances, I made
it clear that One Florida represented a mutual commitment to create and
execute the first statewide plan in the nation to give low-income students,
predominantly minority students, the preparation they need to succeed in
college.  This was a comprehensive plan that included extensive preparation
for teachers and students for both Advanced Placement and pre-AP courses,
for SAT test preparation, for academic tutoring to support students, and for
intense training of administrators in using tools to build pipelines through
which middle school students could progress toward rigorous high school
coursework. This plan has been a remarkable success and a national model
that we at the College Board are deeply proud to be part of.

One of the most unique elements of the Florida Plan is a partnership with
the College Board that provides students with the crucial preparation they
need to succeed in college when admitted.  It is this preparation that is
our common ground and that makes our effort in Florida so important as a
national example of opportunity that can be offered to all students.  

One Florida has worked and will continue to give more and more opportunities
to students throughout Florida.  It is a bold and courageous and innovative
step on your part.  We at the College Board have given our very best efforts
to make this program a success.

The most difficult part of the program was getting it started.  Now it has
momentum and is helping more students every day.

The Supreme Court decision in the Michigan case will have no effect on
whether One Florida works or not.  Those who threaten to take away funding
for the remarkable program that the College Board developed as part of One
Florida would bring a sad ending to a success story that has brought great
hope and opportunity to low-income students who can, in increasing numbers,
access the tools for good preparation for and success in college.

A litany of your and our successes in Florida, achieved over the past few
years, points to the power of our Partnership and our progress toward a
shared vision.  To list just a few successes:  

*	In Florida public schools, the number of African American students
who took AP Examinations increased by 21 percent from 2001 to 2002.  In U.S.
public schools, the number of African American students who took AP
Examinations increased by 13 percent during the same period.
*	
*	In Florida public schools, the number of AP Examinations with scores
of 3 or higher taken by African American students increased 34 percent from
2001 to 2002.  In U.S. public schools, the number of AP Examinations with
scores of 3 or higher taken by African American students increased by 22
percent during the same period.
*	
*	In Florida public schools, the number of Hispanic students who took
AP Examinations increased by 22 percent from 2001 to 2002.  In U.S. public
schools, the number of Hispanic students who took AP Examinations increased
by 15 percent during the same period.
*	
*	In Florida public schools, the number of AP Examinations with scores
of 3 or higher taken by Hispanic students increased 24 percent from 2001 to
2002.  In U.S. public schools, the number of AP Examinations with scores of
3 or higher taken by Hispanic students increased by 17 percent during the
same period.

Expanding the number of AP courses, working in inner city and low-income
communities, organizing community college tutoring programs, these, too, are
part of what we are doing on your behalf for the students in Florida.

I look forward to talking to you personally.

Dear Governor Bush: 

It was a pleasure to see you in Miami last week at the Biltmore. Thank you again for appointing me to the VIII FTAA Ministerial and ABF Board. 

As I mentioned to you last week, President Gutierrez of Ecuador is scheduled to visit with President Bush in Washington on February 11th. In the course of conversation with my father last week in Quito, the President indicated his interest in meeting you personally by  stopping in Florida on the 10th, on his way to Washington. I contacted your office for international affairs in Miami and was told that you were unavailable on the 10th. 

President Gutierrez' office advised me that although it could not be done on this trip, he wants to meet you in the near future. You may prefer to handle this matter through official State Department channels however, I remain at your disposal if you prefer my assistance in coordinating a future meeting.

I hope all is well for you and your family.

Let me see now is this  "Reorganization number 22 or 23?"

Shall we wait a few more years to see if they get it right this time?

Will the Clients be better served by moving the same players around?

Will the providers have anymore incentive for treatment or funding accountability than before the "Reorganization?

Governor Bush appointed a Commission on Mental Health and Substance Abuse.

Did everyone in the endless line of stake holders, waiting hours for their chance to tell it like it really is, say to the Commission, we are satisfied with DCF, DCF just needs a little tweaking?

Did the 23 Commissioner's final report say a job well done, an A+?


Is Governor Bush serious about all the input from stake holders, clamoring for real change, transferring servicing clients with a mental illness a biological brain disease, a medical problem, to the most appropriate place for medical conditions the Health Department?

Anyone who agrees with the above statements do nothing, enjoy your excellent treatment, and consider your self very lucky. 

If you do not agree, what will you do about it?

Is now, the time for action?

If we wait one more day will it be too late?

Legislators are now if not already closing the books on Feb. 7
on legislation they will file this session, if you plan to do something, when, will be it as soon as you receive this?

With all that has happened in DFC, if major changes are not made right now, will they ever be made?

The Honorable Jeb Bush:

I am a commissioner on Volunteer Florida and was unable to attend in
person the Volunteer Florida meeting today, but was able to hear your
remarks via conference call (I am sorry to have also missed the group
photo!).  I appreciate your commitment to children issues and mentoring.
I am excited about working with other commissioners in supporting your
initiative.  I know that Fred and the staff will keep the commissioners
informed as to what we can do to increase the number of mentors in this
state.  Please let me know what other tasks I can perform in order to
support the initiative.  If I have any ideas concerning this project, I
will forward them to you.  Thank you for your continued support of
Volunteer Florida.

Good Morning All!
 
Following up on Gov. Bush's e-mail to you re: our request to see if there is a possibility of having Worldlink  high school students chat with the Governor via live videoconference or a chat room while he is in Spain.
 
As my original message mentioned, Worldlink students from Dr. Michael M. Krop Senior High School are about to sign a
cybercity agreement with students from Madrid.   These students are working on education and trade projects in conjunction with the U. S. Embassy.
 
Look forward to hearing from you!

Subject:	DCF and more

Hi:

 

Any answers back from Jerry Reiger on my “what if” of information you would like on each child in DCF?      I was thinking that it would be useful to know days missed, grades, etc for kids in school.   Maybe things like weight for age, basic skills, etc prior to school.  

 

After all, a huge problem with the school system today is the number of children entering who lack even basic alphabet / number identification skills.    At least with children in DCF, there is money being provided for care so there should be some requirements to provide certain skills.

 

ON ANOTHER ISSUE:   Maybe its just me and my clients, but the stories coming out about William Donaldson and his anti-shareholder positions while at Aetna are about the last thing investors already feeling abused need.     MAYBE ITS TIME TO APPOINT SOMEONE WHO HAS A TRACK RECORD OF SHAREHOLDER ADVOCACY, like the ex-SEC guy that’s working on cleaning up mutual fund ethics/fairness, nor Nell Minow at The corporate Library.

 

IF WE DON’T QUICKLY RESTORE TRUST IN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT’S DESIRE TO TRULY PROTECT INVESTORS, John Galt may not be needed to destroy the economy.     

 

PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF DEMOGRAPHICS.     The fact is, much of what determines a stock price is ratio of willing buyers to willing sellers (like an auction – you can have great stuff, but if no one wants to bid, or has money to bid, or there are few bidders for lots of the same stuff, prices are likely to go down).   In order for most babyboomers to finance a retirement beyond social security  (whether their money is in 401K plan, IRA, or other, if in stocks without dividends, they need buyers to convert to spending money).  If Generation X and Y aren’t interested in buying the stock their parents need to sell to finance retirement .....

 

That could be especially of concern in Florida with so many retirees.  If there aren’t enough “net generation to buy their securities, many may find themselves unable to finance their retirement and will need more tax funded services.

 

I fear for the market if investors think those in charge of making needed changes care more about protecting paychecks and options of executives than protecting the absentee investor.

Dear Governor Bush:

Thanks for your response to my letter.  I'm very pleased you agree that our
partnership is successful and that you want it to continue.  I also agree
that nothing would be better than to have an education system that gave all
students a full opportunity to go to college and be successful.  We at the
College Board are deeply committed to your effort to make this happen.

I understand that you will not be able to participate in the College Board's
regional conference in Tampa on Friday because you must lead the memorial
service in Cape Canaveral in honor of the Columbia astronauts.  It is
devastating to contemplate the loss of these exceptional men and women to
their families and the nation.  

I had looked forward to being with you in Tampa to announce Florida's
Virtual School Partnership with the College Board for Advanced Placement
study.   However, I'm grateful to Lieutenant Governor Brogan for agreeing to
represent you there.

I hope to see you soon.

Sincerely,

Gaston Caperton

Academic tourney fires up this week 
By ANN-MARIE NEWMAN
annmarie@newschief.com <mailto:annmarie@newschief.com> 
WINTER HAVEN -- With science, technology and fine arts facts spinning through their heads, students throughout Polk County are gearing up for the 20th annual High School Academic Tournament set Wednesday and Thursday. 

The event will take place at Lake Region High School at 1995 Thunder Road in Eagle Lake and will kick off on Wednesday at 3 p.m. with that day's competition lasting until 5:30 p.m. The tournament will resume on Thursday from 3:30 p.m. until 5 p.m. An awards ceremony will follow at 5:15 p.m. 

The public is encouraged to attend the after school competitions. Admission is free. 
Each academic team consists of six students -- four players and two alternates -- who have been competing since September, according to Peggy Harrod, academic competitions manager for the district. 

"High schools can carry as many students they like during the practice season, which runs September through January," said Harrod. "The schools then choose six students to represent their school. A total of 199 students will have competed throughout the year." 

Seventeen teams will kick off the competition. The top six teams will return on Thursday to compete the County Championship round. 

"Six members will then be named to the Polk County All-Star Academic Team," Harrod said. 
That team will represent Polk County at the 2003 Commissioner's Academic Challenge, Florida's state championship, in April at Walt Disney World. 

Students at this week's competition will answer questions covering subjects including mathematics, science, language arts, foreign languages, technology, fine arts and humanities. 

The competition is not a quick response, trivial pursuit-type contest, said Harrod, but a slower-paced tournament in which questions are written by educators from high schools throughout the state to mirror existing curricula. 

Sponsored by Bank of America, team members and academic school coaches of the top three teams will receive plaques. The six finalist schools will receive trophies. 

State Farm Insurance through the Polk Education Foundation will award a $500 scholarship to each of the six winning team members. 

Each student selected to be on the All-Star team will also receive a $300 Janis James Scholarship. 
High schools participating in the 2003 Polk County Academic Tournament include: All Saints' Academy, Frostproof Middle/Senior, Bartow Senior, Haines City High, Lake Gibson Senior, Auburndale Senior, Fort Meade Middle/Senior, George Jenkins Senior, Kathleen Senior, Lake Region Senior, Lake Wales Senior, Lakeland Christian, Lakeland Senior, Mckeel Academy, Santa Fe Catholic, Mulberry Senior and Winter Haven High School.

Subject:	Re: Petitioning Procedure for Orange County Community Action Board

State of Florida, Department of Community Affairs,
This letter is being forwarded to your office in order to clarify the
confusion on part of Bobbie Jo Finer and your agency.

The petition was sent to your agency under the provisions of the United
States Constitution, First amendment privilege regarding the right to
petition for redress of grievance(s). This  procedure would not have been
required if your agency had appropriately investigated the complaint sent to
you previously concerning the voting irregularities of JOHN CUMMINGS and the
county employees who violated  the Florida Administrative Codes  which were
provided with the petition to Charles Anderson.
Unfortunately, a massive cover-up and conspiracy against the rights of
Bithlo citizens was attempted, which led to the petition. As you are aware,
county staff chose not to respond to numerous complaints and perceived
conflicts in C.A.B. bylaws, which this writer supplied to the C.A.B. PRIOR
to the "election" in October, 2000. Therefore, the Orange county Community
Action Board (JOHN CUMMINGS)APPOINTED a wealthy non-resident, Leroy Scott,
whom the staff had known for a total of SIX MONTHS, as accurate
representation for poor residents whose names appear on the petition.
If Bobbie Jo Finer is so eager to nullify this legal petition, why can't she
be as eager to investigate the conspiracy against rights of Bithlo
residents? Further, why does she allow LEROY SCOTT to violate C.A.B. bylaws
which require the representative to stay in contact with local leaders and
residents in Bithlo?
The only people who can meet and speak with this wealthy non-resident are
those similarly situated and have funds to purchase his time.
Is that Ms. Finers description of fairness or accurate representation?

My question is , if over one hundred signatures of Bithlo residents is
inadequate for accurate representation, why does Bobbie Jo Finer consider
ONE vote adequate for ACCURATE representation, when in fact it represents
fraud?

Please understand that as the ELECTED representative for the poor citizens
of Bithlo I have a civic duty to expose fraud , waste, abuse and
mismanagement in all levels of government, which I intend to begin with this
letter and will not stop until and unless a common standard of fairness and
decency is provided to the poor being served on this Board.

I cannot expect Bobbie Jo Finer to fully understand the severity of this
problem since in the past she has exhibited difficulty in performing all but
the simplest of tasks and an overwhelming favoritism for county staff over
common citizens.
Further, as a public servant it is my understanding that Bobbie Jo Finer has
taken an oath to uphold and defend the United States Constitution, including
the right to petition for redress of grievance(s).
Unfortunately, Ms. Finer has failed in her attempt to nullify this right in
what can most charitably be described as a weak and wicked attempt to
promote the territorial dictatorship of Orange County poor citizens.

This letter will serve as official notice to Ms. Finer and your agency that
until and unless a law or exemption is provided to justify  her refusal to
comply with the provisions of the United States Constitution, I shall remain
as the elected Community Representative for East Orange County on the Orange
County Community Action Board. Moreover, until an equal amount of citizens
elect anyone other than this writer to this position, criminal violations of
Florida Administrative Codes and Federal Register provisions will be
reported to Federal and State agencies who fund any plan or program
initiated or supported by the Orange County Community Action Board.

I strongly suggest that Ms. Finer read and understand the U.S. Constitution
and hope she will comply with a public record request, under the provisions
of f.S. 119, to provide this writer a complete list of the names of
individuals whom she has knowledge of who elected anyone other than this
writer to a position on the Orange County Community Action Board. for East
Orange County in a democratic fashion adequate to ensure they are accurate
representation for the poor being served on this board..

Failure to respond will be accepted as admission that none exist and the
petition is adequate to comply with this requirement of Florida
administrative Codes.

In conclusion, I must state my extreme disgust with anyone who deprives
citizens rights from poor people in the manner which is being attempted by
Ms. Finer. She obviously has no conscience or compassion for the less
fortunate and does not quite understand that until government works for the
least of us, it doesn't work for any of us.-Please find it in your heart of
hearts to explain this to Ms. Finer in the hope of eliminating her
delusional state concerning this important matter. I will continue to pray
for her recovery.

Subject:	Decreased funding to Juvinille Justice CINS/FINS

It has come to my attention that as of 1/28/03 your new plan has put a halt to the CINS petition I have been waiting for a year was stopped on the day it was to go to the judge.  I find it appalling that you would take from vital youth safety net programs for your own interest of alcohol and drug rehab.  I am a single mother middle class income who on one end has a13 yo daughter who has been a chronic runaway in Jacksonville for a year and the Government you so proudly lead does not offer any programs to help parents who need it except for the CINS/FINS through Youth Crisis Center which delays and evaluates for months prior to admitting to the true solution of Judicial assistance and since running away is not breaking the law it is allowed to continue. You have now reinforced to my daughter that she can do whatever she wants because her ungovernable behavior has no consequence and if she doesn't like her punishment at home she can runaway and there is nothing I can do and I have to take her back or your Children and Family workers will have me arrested for neglect.   

On the other hand I have a 5yo who's kindergarten class has 25 children in a Spanish immersion magnet program with one assistant for an hour per week.  This is appauling that this is allowed to go on.  You are going to continue to loose children to this cruel world for lack of programs and supervision.   

I want you to compare your legislature new laws for long term care staffing to those of your elementary education.  As of 1/1/03 there is to be 2.6hr of c.n.a.'s for every patient in  a long term care facility.  For example if there is 25 pts there must be 65hrs of c.n.a if you divide it by 7.5 there normal work shift it comes to 8.66=9 c.n.a's in a 24hour period.   

Now look at my sons kindergarten class which is now at 25 students but in August was at 30, divide 25 by 8hrs teacher spends with students it comes to .32 per child, a difference of 2.28hr per day.  I thought the children were the future.  Don't get me wrong the elderly are a vital part of our community but they too would agree that the youth are just as important if not more.  I do understand that some studies show that smaller class sizes are not always the answer but I don't agree in early childhood education where children not only have to learn to adapt to a new set of expectations and learn how to sit still for hours at a time. 

I look forward to hearing a response and please be advised that as far as the decrease in funding to the CINS/FINS programing and redirection of Youth Crisis program from juvenile justice to Children's and Families which has many of its own problems you and your new director have not even begun to correct you have not heard the last.  I will begin to seek the attention of PTA's and local organizations until you here our voice.

Subject: Ringling Museum


Jeb,

Sorry about the delayed response to your e-mail. To date, the Ringling Museum has signed or has received strong verbal pledges of $4 million towards the $10 million challenge. We also have a number of other proposals pending, and are essentially on course to meet our very ambitious goal.

There may be some confusion between operating funds and capital funds. The arrangement that I recall pledged $10 million to endow the new buildings that would be constructed with the $43 million capital appropriation.  Both the $10 million and the $43 million were earmarked for long-term development. To the best of my understanding, the annual museum operating funds  were not involved in the challenge.   

Attendance is up significantly and we are on course to increase the number of visitors by about 100,000 this year.  Note that about half of our visitors are tourists from out of state.  Our improved operations are bringing in far more visitors, but a major revenue shortfall in the near future would surely curtail the growth that is necessary to make the museum less dependent.

Sincerely, 

Vern Buchanan

Dear Mr Bush,

      it has been awhile since I wrote you. Hope family is well and I can see by what i read you are doing a good job.The nuns and I are still waiting to see you when you come to St Augustine.Lol you know I always have to put that in.

     Today we had a rally at Flagler Hospital to bring attention to raising cost of Ins our doctors have to pay. We are losing important Dr who can no longer afford the high premiums.My Dr is one of those who may leave.Dr Dobbertein is one of the best surgen ever to work in St Augustine and the reason I am still alive today. In less then two yrs he sucessfully pulled me through two major surguries.I know of a lot of his patients oof his and they all love and trust him.It isn't only Dr Dobbertein, one Dr has practice here for 27 years and is loved by all his patients also.I beg you to do what ever you can to put and end to this madness and a cap on what can be reasonable to be sued for if it really must be done. To many people and lawyers are sue crazy though and that also takes toll .Please help our Doctors to be able to help us.Thank You.

George called you a "moderate" and I gave him a look and said I disagreed and said I viewed you as a conservative.

Governor Bush we would be so honored for you to attend our adoption with our family.  Without your assistance, this dream would not be coming true for all of us.  You are a part of our family and would love for you to partake in this blessed event.

I would love to notify the press, but will wait until you tell me so.  We were told that DCF WILL NOT be contesting or appealing the adoption. Please say a prayer for all of us.

Once again, I know you are busy, but this is all possible because of you and I want you to see the family that you have created. A family that will always have a place for you in our hearts.

God Bless.

Dear Jeb,

Hope you and the family are well.

Charlotte County Commission Chairman, Mac Horton, spoke to us at Rotary this
morning - among other things he noted we all owed you a debt of thanks for
helping Charlotte County, especially Englewood, with the pending dredging of
Stump Pass. Thanks...this is very important to our area.

Chuck Bonamer of Venice does consulting work for our real estate company and
mentioned he is hoping to be added to the F.R.E.C.  I think he would be a
great addition.

It's great that we are going to continue to have and grow our small Island
School in Boca Grande - it wasn't easy but it was entertaining - and
certainly worth the effort!

Finally, Ken and I would love to have you come down and get in a little golf
and/or fishing anytime you can.

Thanks for all the things you do for all Floridians, we are fortunate to
have you.

I really don't want to bug you again, but we really need to hear from some additional charter schools in Florida. Can you spare 5 minutes please? The Walton Foundation, which is sponsoring this research, really wants to hear from more charter school operators. The drawing for the five $1,000 school awards will occur on Friday, so please respond today. Thanks much.
__________________

I know you are a very busy person running your charter school. However, our research team needs a few minutes of your time to share your thoughts on the job your charter authorizer is doing. We'll try to make it worth your time.

As the charter school movement matures, there is growing interest in understanding the role "authorizers" play in the process of approving and monitoring charter schools. This study, supported by the Walton Foundation and the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, is examining such practices in 24 key charter school states. The goal is to learn more about the challenging task of authorizing, which in turn can be used to further strengthen the charter school movement.

Please be aware that information from this survey is not intended to place judgment on individual authorizers, but to provide a collective view of what is happening within a given state. Your input is important.

To this end, you are invited to respond to the attached on-line survey. Your responses will remain confidential. Also, if multiple individuals within your organization receive this survey, each is welcome to complete it. If you, however, receive multiple copies, please only respond to one.

If you have any questions about this study, please feel free to contact Dr. Louann Bierlein Palmer, the lead researcher for the project at
L.BierleinPalmer@wmich.edu or 269/387-3596.

As an incentive, five charter school operators will win $1,000 each for their school (as randomly selected from those who complete this on-line survey). Winners will be notified by the end of January 2003.

Dear Gov. Bush:

I am so ashamed of my City Commission in their "resolution" against the President, United States Senate and Congress, and our concerns with Saddam Heusein and Iraq.    Their "anti-war" resolution certainly does not reflect my feelings about what we face in the country today with regard to Iraq but even more repulsive is that it implies my consent.   NOT SO, but I have now NO voice in the matter.

I am still trying to understand WHEN the City of Key West was given the task of  second guessing the United States policies and also WHY this is "city business"?  I also wonder if any of the City Commission bothered to watch Secretary Powell's speech this morning? 

I can not express my sorrow strong enough ... and I keep hearing the words of President Bush in the War on Terror:  "you are either with us, or against us" ...    

Thank you for listening .... with best wishes ..

Subject: Recommendation for appointment of Alan Deserio to the 2d DCA


Dear Governor Bush,
 
Every now and then a nominee comes before you that deserves a special recommendation. Alan is such a person. I expect that everyone on the list has the intellect and experience to be an appellate judge. What distinguishes Alan is his servant spirit. His worldview is grounded in his faith in God and his political and social philosophies are consistent with his worldview. Alan respects the law and would not use his position to advance a personal agenda. He has consistently placed others before himself throughout his career and needs his friends to tell his story for him-he’s too humble to do a good job of it himself. He’s an excellent lawyer who would serve this state well as a jurist. I could go on about his career and achievements but they pale in comparison to his character and integrity. I could not give anyone a higher recommendation.
 
My family attended your inauguration and we were encouraged by the thoughts you shared on the Capitol steps. I pray that the Lord will continue to bless your efforts to lead our state.

Dear Governor Bush,

I understand that you have the most difficult task of selecting individuals
to serve as members of the newly created, Miami-Dade County Children's
Trust. I would like to offer my support of one candidate; Mr. Charles
Auslander.

I had the privilege of serving at the Florida Department of Children and
Families, District 11, from July, 1998 to December, 2002. In my original
role at DCF, I oversaw the Mental Health, Substance Abuse, Development
Disability, and Adult Services programs. After the disappearance of Rilya
Wilson, I was asked by Kate Kearney, Larry Pintacuda, and Charles Auslander
to assume the role of Charles Auslander's Director of Operations (the
equivalent of a Deputy District Administrator). Thus, I had a very close
professional relation with Charles for many years. I am now working for
Miami-Dade County, as the Acting Executive Director of the Homeless Trust.
Upon our recent departures from DCF, both Charles, and I were asked by our
Community Based Care Alliance to serve on the CBC Alliance Board. We
gratefully accepted this honor, and are both working, as CBC Alliance
members to assure a smooth transition to Community Based Care in Miami-Dade
County.

Over my career at DCF, I had the privilege of working closely with Charles
Auslander, and found him to be the most intelligent and caring person I ever
encountered. Charles worked tirelessly on behalf of the children of our
community, formerly, as DCF's legal counsel, and for the past 3 years as
District Administrator. I know that you had several dealings with Charles
over the past year, which may have been one of the most difficult in the
history of DCF. I imagine that you share the opinion of  the Miami-Dade
Community,  who view Charles as a man of outstanding character,
unquestionable ethics and honesty, and one who always strives to do the
right thing. His knowledge of the integration of child welfare, children's
mental health and legal issues regarding children and families is unparalled
in this, and probably other communities around the State and Country.
Charles' ongoing concern for children is further demonstrated in his desire
to serve on the Children's Trust, as well as his continued service to the
CBC Alliance Board. The community was blessed to have Charles at the head of
DCF for many years. I would consider it an equal blessing for Charles to
serve our community on the Children's Trust.

I wish you success in your deliberations.

Very truly yours,

David Raymond

Subject: City of Largo fiasco


Good Day Governor Bush:  I am respectively requesting that the State of Florida commence an immediate and thorough investigation of the actions of the Largo City Commission.  Specifically;
 
1.  Effectively the mayor, Robert Jackson, is ruling by decree.  By his own admission he's making up rules and protocols on a whim.  For example there has been a standing rule that if someone is representing a group that individual will be granted 10 minutes to address the Commission during any given, non legislative, citizen comment segment.  I am the president of the Taxpayers Association, and they know this...they actually asked for, and were supplied, detailed written confirmations months ago.   Speaker/public input rules can only be made by consent of the COMMISSION, not an arbitrary declaration of the mayor.  Evening last, upon approaching the podium the mayor abruptly informed me "you have 3 minutes."  I said "excuse me...did I miss a work session or have you JUST changed the rules?"  He affirmed that he JUST changed the rules.  This is a pattern...if a speaker does not agree with the Largo ruling elite every attempt is made to either discredit the speaker (the proverbial "cheap-shots" at the end of the meeting) or the Commission will do their absolute best to stifle the speaker.  Then they actually wonder why people don't attend their meetings.  Why should we?  Historically citizen input is completely ignored.
 
2.  Due to the "resign to run" State statute the commission had a vacancy.  Not wishing to belabor a point but our lamb-duck Commission decided to fill the seat.  Why the urgency is still a mystery considering that elections are less than a month away with only one more Commission meeting and one work session...but now we're stuck with an un-elected (appointed) commissioner for a year.  Oddly enough even the St. Petersburg Times questioned why the City of Largo was in such a hurry to appoint someone.  Anyway...during the public comment, about the appointment, I asked the mayor, "knowing that the City received applications, for this vacancy, as late as Thursday last...have you run background checks on any of them?"  Not getting an answer I asked the question again...and finally the mayor confirmed what I already knew, "NO we have not run a background check on any of them."  I then pointed out that according to the City Charter, section 2.07, (a)(3) "(a commissioner can be removed if) convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude..."  My comment was, "if someone can be removed for an act of "moral turpitude" certainly they can't be appointed unless you've confirmed that they haven't."  My input and concern was COMPLETELY ignored.  Again they are ignoring their own rules AND the City Charter.   Noteworthy it takes longer to clear airport security than it does to get appointed to the existing Largo City Commission.
 
3.  The mayor in conjunction with the Commission committed another heinous breach.  The St. Petersburg Times newspaper, in conjunction with the Johnny come lately Chamber of Commerce decided to hold a candidates "forum," to be held within the Commission Chamber and broadcast on government access, Largo television, LTV, channel 15.  Via section 9, of the Public Services Access Channels (television) agreement it states, "Such Channels SHALL be used EXCLUSIVELY for purposes of government and education access programming on a non-commercial, not-for-profit basis."  The proposed "forum" is blatant campaigning and has nothing to do with the bailiwick of "government."  Also the newspaper is a for-profit entity and they will, without a doubt, receive FREE advertising at the taxpayers expense.  It is worth mentioning, there are several private groups who have extended debate invitations, to all the candidates, but with the exception of the challengers none of the invitations have been accepted, thus far.  When the Commission voted to approve the newspaper's scheme, a newspaper that has had nothing nice to say about any of the challengers, without a doubt this is a clear violation of the Public Services Access Channels agreement.
 
It goes without saying I could continue the list of egregious breaches of public confidence for pages on end but, confidence is high, this is enough for starters.
 
I would greatly appreciate it if the State of Florida would commence a thorough and immediate investigation of the violations of citizens rights that have become a matter of routine with the Largo City Commission.
 
Respectively,

Gov. Bush, our belated congratulations on your impressive win last Nov!  In checking with our contacts around the state, there did not appear to be any doubt you would win!  It was "a piece of cake"!

Now we see your Lt. Gov. has resigned.   Why did he stay on your ticket if he was planning on taking another job?  Who are you considering for a replacement?  It would be great to see Jim Smith, Jim Horne or Toni Jennings in that spot!  Any of those three would be an asset - knowledgeable, popular with the voters and above all ethical. 

When in Tallahassee in mid-March with the Clay County Group, I look forward to speaking with you.

Governor:
 
I received a call from your appointments office advising me that you had appointed me to the Criminal Justice Standards and Training Commission.  Thank you soooo much for your confidence in me and for giving me this opportunity to continue to serve!  I assure you that I will fulfill my duties on the Commission diligently and will give the issues the time and consideration they deserve.
 
I recently watched a replay of your inauguration address - it was even better the second time!  Your continued commitment to the people of this state was clearly evident and I must tell you how moved I was with your comments about your family.  Your son did an awesome job as the facilitator of the event - is he going to take your place in 4 years?  I'll be on board to help him if he does decide to do the politics thing!
 
I had a wonderful holiday season with my family this year - my son came home for over 10 days from Camp Pendleton, my parents were here, my 89 year old grandmother and my aunt (both of whom I am named for) came, etc.  I actually cooked, decorated and cleaned (my least favorite) which due to my previous schedule with DCF, had been unable to do with much enthusiasm over the past several years.  Needless to say, I scored some points back with my family!  I have been busy doing some decorating of my home - projects that had been put on the back burner for a while.  I even wallpapered a bathroom - I had never done it before, but I figured if I could handle what I did at DCF, surely I could wallpaper a room - well - I succeeded!  It sure felt wonderful to see a completed project - sometimes in government, we hope we are moving things forward, but often do not get to see the results quickly.  
 
Most of my friends and colleagues are surprised that I am not completely bored and ready to reenter the work world - guess that time will come, but I still have two pages of "home" projects I need to do first!  My 15 year old daughter is quite ready for Mom to go back to work, as she will be driving in several months and can't believe I won't be able to buy her a car.  (Kids seem to expect so much - this has been a good learning experience for her, too!)
 
My entire family is headed to San Diego in about 10 days to see my son.  His reserve unit has been called to active duty, so when he completes his training on the 25th of February, he will likely travel overseas to join them. (Still a possibility that he could serve his active duty time in Jacksonville where the unit is based - that's what this Mom is praying for!)  Anyway, I must tell you that I made a good decision for the sake of my family and myself several months ago by deciding to take a sabbatical - I needed to spend this time at home more than I even realized.
 
Lori Fahey, Family CAFE, has asked me to serve on their board and I have agreed.  I know this too is an area that you hold dear, so whatever I can do for them to further the  cause, I will do.  Chris Knight, FHP, asked if I might be willing to serve on their promotional board - I said yes, but will wait and see what happens with that.  All of this to say, that I am still trying to stay connected to the "outside" world even though I'm not "officially" in it.
 
Please let me know if there is ever anything I can assist you or the administration with.  At the moment, I'm not ready to "work" on a full time basis, but am available if you need me to assist in any way.  Again, thank you for giving me the opportunity to serve on the CJS&T Commission - I promise that I will serve the commission on your behalf with great pride!
 
All the best to you and your family - hope you have the best year yet!  (My phone numbers in case Betty doesn't have them - home - 656-6662   cell 556-1371)

Tom, the transfer of investigative aspects of the child welfare system is not a bad thing but a good one. It is being done successfully already and should be done statewide. Check out Seminole, Pinellas, Manatee and Broward Counties and see what I mean. As it relates to the legal situation, the rights of children won't be deprived, they will be enhanced by having private lawyers handle this functions. The savings will go into an improved child welfare system.

Subject: Reigers plan


Having officers that are sworn to uphold the law might not be the best solution to an underfunded DCF program. Eliminating legal advocates for adolescents will further deprive them the due process of the law that every child deserves. The state clearly should become proactive in developing less traumatic type therapies for adolescent substance abusers i.e. prorated  compassionate wilderness boot camps with high level of family involvement and counseling. Corralling misguided youth in uncarpeted building is like having a large dog with no back yard. Reiger's plan to eliminate legal advocates for children is a abomination to our constitution that allows all to pursue happiness. Many of your political allies feel trouble kids have no rights, many times wrongfully incarcerating siblings with no history of any problem. We need to provide advocates for these children to level the playing field and make sure no child is denied access to the legal system. 
 
This militant crack down (cops, denial of access to legal counsel for youth) is not part of president's proclamation, in his address to the nation, ushering in a new era of accessibility of treatment for the so afflicted. 
 
 
The constitution amendment for class size reduction was a vote against privatization of schooling and the voucher program in general. The republican party forcing some minority views on the populist will again result in a reaction the is much greater (like class size amendment) than any of us would want. I think you should reign in this guy Reiger and nix this elimination of advocates for children. He should look to compromise on the level law enforcement plays in this. There are gray areas in family situations. Law enforcement is black and white. They are sworn to uphold the law.
 
p.s. I hope Orlando gets funds the renovate (actually I think they are looking for funding for operating expenses)  the old Mercy Hospital for area detox and mental health. We were denied 4 years ago when you first came into office. Now is the time...give Orlando some relief.

Dear Governor Bush,

I am a foster parent in the State of Florida.  I understand the magnitude of the problem in this state.  However, there is a grave mistake being made on behalf of two small children under the protection of this state.  My sister-in-law is also a foster parent.  Her and her husband are in the process of trying to adopt two young children who have been in the care of the State of Florida for over a year.  Lani is now two years old and David is three.  They were removed from their mother when she was sent to prison for drugs and prostituting her teenage daughter (their sister).    Her parental rights have been terminated.  The father is a native of Hawaii.  The mother fled to Florida where her family resides because he was on drugs and abusive.  DCF has worked to either reunite the children with their father (always the first choice, if possible), or terminate his parental rights and allow these children to be adopted into a loving family.  Since this has began, the father has failed to complete the DCF plan and continues to fail it.   He has failed two random drug tests.  He is on welfare and food stamps in Hawaii, with one other child living with him.    Two weeks ago the Lee County Judge handling this case stated that he didn't see why these two children were in his courtroom that he couldn't see why they weren't with their father in Hawaii.  He also stated that this was a Hawaii problem, not a Florida problem and ordered DCF in Hawaii to come get the children.  This is an outrage to these children who know no other place than Florida.  This is their home and has been for over a year.  The father has made no effort to be in contact with them.  He has failed to do what is required to have his children returned.  Judge Anderson should be removed from this case and all cases involving children if it is so easy for him to dismiss them as another state's problem.  How can the State of Florida just wash their hands of these children?  Their own teenage sister has testified that this man gave her drugs and beat her when they lived in Hawaii.  As a foster parent, a Florida Resident and a voting citizen, I demand a formal review of this case and request that as Governor you step in and see that these Florida Residents are protected by this state and not thrown away.

The case is being handled by Lee County DCF.  The case worker is Elaine Carter who can be reached at (239) 656-7135.  Please stop these children from being placed with an abusive drug using father.  Please stop the cycle of abuse in this family.

I pray you will receive this message and act quickly before they it is too late.

Brother Jeb,

I have seen ten years of injustice (in the system), and would like to see something honest and fair for a change. I have never asked for myself. But have spoken out to help others-those around me. We had high hopes that an under dog would get Calvin's old job- Building manager for the Carlton Group. We took care of his job for two months when he (Calvin) was on Medical leave. And have run things for a month now that he is retired. But I have to speak up now so you will know how I feel about being lied to. 

The Deputy Chief came by today to speak to the Carlton Group of works and did inform us that one of the Boys in the system will be taking over Calvin's job slot Feb 28, 2003. The deputy lied and said he was doing all he could for the Carlton workers. It was obvious to the men that he has no intention of doing anything for anyone except the new man coming on board. The person chosen for the job has been in the system approximately 20 years- is connected high up because his wife works for one of the deputy directors. We personally know this man about to take over the Carlton Group as a die hard Democrat that did not support, or vote for you. And we have heard him speak out against the present administration. It is tough, a hard thing to speak to you these things- you may be angry, please forgive.

I have a Wife, a son in school and a 78 year old elderly mother that I am trying to take care of and I need the state of Florida Job, and benefits, but the in-Justus of it all is hurting me. I am willing to help you and the agency any way I can, but please don't ask me to do this mans job for him. I am sending to you this personal communications in hope that you will be merciful and keep this between us. We had a vision of the under dog getting the job this is why we would not ask for our self. It is time for example to have a woman building manager, or someone of Arab ethnicity, or... 

I would not ask, but I am asking now, not for me, but for my family, do you have a job for me. I am not asking for the Carlton job. I have Law enforcement training/experience and am 50% Native American. I would like to be part of the new task force, or part of the Council on Indian affairs, or other KSA job. If I have to sweep the floors and lock the doors at the end of the day, just so I can feel like my contribution is welcomed and appreciated.

Jesus said, "Be angry and sin not." I do not want to cause any trouble of rock any boats- tell me what you would like for me to do. 

Thank You.

February 6, 2003 

"Columbia's Family" 

 Back in January 1986, NASA had it's first space shuttle tragedy. I was in 7th grade at the time, when I heard the news. I didn't belive it, because I never saw any explosion involving NASA. I remember many School Students cried, because Krista McCauliff was on "Challenger". She was a School Teacher and planned to teach a class from space. Classes we're stopped, so kids watched the launch. What turned into a day of joy, became extreme sadness. 
 Students in Bay County were affected by the "Challenger" tragedy. That very night, Christian singer Carman ("The Champion" movie/album) was scheduled to appear. The concert went on, which brought immediate comfort to Bay County youth. Carman came to Panama City First Assembly of God. 
 My friend Phil Edwards was then/now Pastor. He opened up the service, by asking everyone to stand and pray for the families of the "Challenger" tragedy. I take a page from Phil's book, and ask you to join me in prayer for the "Colombia's" families. 

"Father, 

We pray for the familes of "Colombia". We ask You comfort them and bring them strength. Holy Spirit, we ask You make Your presence and love real to them; like never before. We ask You send people their way, with the love of Jesus, to help them in anything they need. We pray that their loved one's death will never be in vain. Just like the soldiers of our great military, these astronauts died for this Country. Lord, we thank You for these great hero's and pray they will be remembered as hero's of America. We thank You for our President, who spoke word's of heroship and acknowledged their "arrival home". Home to heaven and the waiting arms of You, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. We ask and praise you for it all, in Jesus' name. 

Amen."

Dear Governor Jeb Bush,
 
I sent a letter to you on November 19, 2002 pertaining to the support of the Florida Veterans and the National Veteran's Voting Bloc Pledge you took in supporting Veterans issues here in Florida. One major issue we requested is your help in obtaining an additional VA Regional Claims Office here in Florida to cut down on the long delays in the VA looking at claims here in Florida, sometimes, the Veteran has passed away before their claim is looked at, the Florida Veterans deserve better than this. As I mentioned in my letter, Florida has the Nation's most disabled Veterans and with only one claims office.
 
I tour the entire State of Florida giving presentations dealing with Veterans issues to all the Veterans organizations and this question always comes up, I have not heard from your office in this matter, so how do you want me to handle the response I must give to these Veterans that are asking what are you and the State of Florida are doing at present and handling this matter. I will be departing on another tour on the 11th of this month again giving these Veterans presentations and hope that you or your staff gives me some guidance in answering these Veterans questions in this matter. They are so desperately calling out to you and the State of Florida for your help.

Governor:
 
The position I was put in by Don and the system - I left Seminole County and settled, in my divorce, for far less than I was entitled in order that I may end the battle with Don and move on.  The problem that arises is that Don is court ordered, by Judge Perry, to pay me a certain amount of money on the 1st of every month - only until March.  Each month has been a struggle to get the money from Don.  This month, and today is the 6th, Don has again not adheared to the court order.  The money from Don is to pay rent in Coral Springs until I get back on my feet.  Every day that Don does not pay incurrs late fees and puts me and my children in jeopardy of not having a place to live.
 
I write to you because I know it is against the law to violate a court order and that certainly Don is not exempt.  As you know, until now, he has skated through his illegal behaviors.
 
I want to make you aware that one of your sheriff's continues to break the law and ask that you take action as I can not afford to hire another attorney to enforce an order I have already paid to get.
 
I pray that you will empathize with my financial situation and take some appropriate action this time.
 
Thank you - Coleen Eslinger

Subject:	Appointees

Dear Governor Bush
 
The Governor's Appointee office reappointed 3 Appointees today to the Tourism Commission.  Nothing has effectively changed since 1998.  The most disappointing Appointee was last year when R. Dean Fowler was appointed from our region, when Visit Florida could have made a recommendation from another area, which could have affected a broader representation of the region.  There is nothing wrong with Mr. Fowler's appointment except that his association with Visit Florida goes back to the previous administration.  Have things really changed?  These folks have been here before your administration and will be afterwards.  Opportunities to broaden Visit Florida's partisan agenda in the Gainesville-Lake City-Stienhatchee area, which exclude the rest ot the area, have been missed. The continuation of large capital projects at the expense of small businesses and taxpayers still continues in the Suwannee River Basin.  The agencies and pseudo agencies had the opportunity to include everybody but did not.  They know these people will still be here in 2006, when you are not.  
 
Visit Florida now has the opportunity to broaden their narrow partisan agenda by appointing a broader range of people to their "Advisory Committees."  Do you think you could help the under represented regions with this?  We still have a majority of pre-1998 people on these committees.  They remain very partisan.  Please check who is on these committees.

Jeb, I know you know this, but please make sure you are clear in your mind about what the job description of the LG job should be to best meet your needs before you select a candidate.  Frank was your legislative liaison, but you have Jim and-- practically speaking --yourself to do that.  It seems to me that the demands on your job and those in your office are so huge over the next couple of years that you need someone to help supervise the execution of your executive decisions down at the agency level,  so think about giving a COO type operational responsibility, recognizing all the while that that person would still report to you as CEO. This would free up you and Kathleen to work on the really tough stuff,---new initiatives, budget, consensus building, etc.
 
Whatever structure you decide on don't appoint someone just to be 'different' or 'diverse' or to create exciting possibilities in the governor's race for  '06.  By far and away pick someone who is battle tested, smart, mature,  energetic, and knowledgeable about state government and Tallahassee-someone whom you already know you can absolutely trust and who is unquestionably loyal to you.  
 
I hope I am not wearing out my 'free to give advice' welcome mat.  I hope I am in that category of 'seldom to give advice' group to which you do listen when they do pop off, as I am doing now.

Subject:	"The dictator of Iraq is making his choice. Now the nation's of	the SecurityCouncil must make their own."

Below is this afternoon's statement by the President on Iraq. I thought it may
interest you.



                                THE WHITE HOUSE
                           STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT
                               The Roosevelt Room
                                February 6, 2003

4:33 P.M. EST

THE PRESIDENT:  The Secretary of State has now briefed the United Nations
Security Council on Iraq's illegal weapons programs, its attempts to hide those
weapons, and its links to terrorist groups.  I want to thank Secretary Powell
for his careful and powerful presentation of the facts.

The information in the Secretary's briefing and other information in our
possession was obtained through great skill, and often at personal risk.
Uncovering secret information in a totalitarian society is one of the most
difficult intelligence challenges.  Those who accept that challenge, both in our
intelligence services and in those of our friends and allies, perform a great
service to all free nations.  And I'm grateful for their good work.

The Iraqi regime's violations of Security Council resolutions are evident,
and they continue to this hour.  The regime has never accounted for a vast
arsenal of deadly biological and chemical weapons.  To the contrary; the regime
is pursuing an elaborate campaign to conceal its weapons materiels, and to hide
or intimidate key experts and scientists, all in direct defiance of Security
Council 1441.

This deception is directed from the highest levels of the Iraqi regime,
including Saddam Hussein, his son, the Vice President, and the very official
responsible for cooperating with inspectors.  In intercepted conversations, we
have heard orders to conceal materiels from the U.N. inspectors.  And we have
seen through satellite images concealment activity at close to 30 sites,
including movement of equipment before inspectors arrive.

The Iraqi regime has actively and secretly attempted to obtain equipment
needed to produce chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.  Firsthand witnesses
have informed us that Iraq has at least seven mobile factories for the
production of biological agents, equipment mounted on trucks and rails to evade
discovery.  Using these factories, Iraq could produce within just months
hundreds of pounds of biological poisons.

The Iraqi regime has acquired and tested the means to deliver weapons of
mass destruction.  All the world has now seen the footage of an Iraqi Mirage
aircraft with a fuel tank modified to spray biological agents over wide areas.
Iraq has developed spray devices that could be used on unmanned aerial vehicles
with ranges far beyond what is permitted by the Security Council.  A UAV
launched from a vessel off the American coast could reach hundreds of miles
inland.

Iraq has never accounted for thousands of bombs and shells capable of
delivering chemical weapons.  The regime is actively pursuing components for
prohibited ballistic missiles.  And we have sources that tell us that Saddam
Hussein recently authorized Iraqi field commanders to use chemical weapons  --
the very weapons the dictator tells the world he does not have.

One of the greatest dangers we face is that weapons of mass destruction
might be passed to terrorists, who would not hesitate to use those weapons.
Saddam Hussein has longstanding, direct and continuing ties to terrorist
networks.  Senior members of Iraqi intelligence and al Qaeda have met at least
eight times since the early 1990s.  Iraq has sent bomb-making and document
forgery experts to work with al Qaeda.  Iraq has also provided al Qaeda with
chemical and biological weapons training.

We also know that Iraq is harboring a terrorist network, headed by a senior
al Qaeda terrorist planner.  The network runs a poison and explosive training
center in northeast Iraq, and many of its leaders are known to be in Baghdad.
The head of this network traveled to Baghdad for medical treatment and stayed
for months.  Nearly two dozen associates joined him there and have been
operating in Baghdad for more than eight months.

The same terrorist network operating out of Iraq is responsible for the
murder, the recent murder, of an American citizen, an American diplomat,
Laurence Foley.  The same network has plotted terrorism against France, Spain,
Italy, Germany, the Republic of Georgia, and Russia, and was caught producing
poisons in London.  The danger Saddam Hussein poses reaches across the world.

This is the situation as we find it.  Twelve years after Saddam Hussein
agreed to disarm, and 90 days after the Security Council passed Resolution 1441
by a unanimous vote, Saddam Hussein was required to make a full declaration of
his weapons programs.  He has not done so.  Saddam Hussein was required to fully
cooperate in the disarmament of his regime; he has not done so.  Saddam Hussein
was given a final chance; he is throwing that chance away.

The dictator of Iraq is making his choice.  Now the nations of the Security
Council must make their own.  On November 8th, by demanding the immediate
disarmament of Iraq, the United Nations Security Council spoke with clarity and
authority.  Now the Security Council will show whether its words have any
meaning. Having made its demands, the Security Council must not back down, when
those
demands are defied and mocked by a dictator.

The United States would welcome and support a new resolution which makes
clear that the Security Council stands behind its previous demands.  Yet
resolutions mean little without resolve.  And the United States, along with a
growing coalition of nations, is resolved to take whatever action is necessary
to defend ourselves and disarm the Iraqi regime.

On September the 11th, 2001, the American people saw what terrorists could
do, by turning four airplanes into weapons.  We will not wait to see what
terrorists or terrorist states could do with chemical, biological, radiological
or nuclear weapons.  Saddam Hussein can now be expected to begin another round
of empty concessions, transparently false denials.  No doubt, he will play a
last-minute game of deception.  The game is over.

All the world can rise to this moment.  The community of free nations can
show that it is strong and confident and determined to keep the peace.  The
United Nations can renew its purpose and be a source of stability and security
in the world.  The Security Council can affirm that it is able and prepared to
meet future challenges and other dangers.  And we can give the Iraqi people
their chance to live in freedom and choose their own government.

Saddam Hussein has made Iraq into a prison, a poison factory, and a torture
chamber for patriots and dissidents. Saddam Hussein has the motive and the means
and the recklessness and the hatred to threaten the American people.  Saddam
Hussein will be stopped.

Thank you.

Understand from FDLE Supervisor Agent John Burke that there is reportedly a
sanitized brief coming from the FBI today regarding a "dirty" bomb possible
already being in the US.  The theory is that when bombs drop overseas this
bomb will be deployed and bringing the way back over here.  JTTFs across the
country are ramping up to address everyone they have been watching and going
ahead and rounding them up and getting them out of country. 

Don't have any details but INS is also involved so may need to be a topic of

Dear Governor Bush
 
I spoke with Jason Rodriguez at the Appointee Office.  We had a very qualified person, who has been a long standing registered Republican and a member of our Tourism Development Council.  Many now switch to the Republican Party to get the Appointments, by the way, while party faithful continue to be overlooked.  It is referred to as "duping the system" in the Suwannee River Basin.  
 
Jason informed Mr. Tuckey that they were looking for someone more in the tourism business.  Please explain Mary B. Craven's or others' appointments, when their only qualifications are Tourist Development Councils. There is a double standard in the Suwannee River Basin.  Only you can change this.

Dear Governor Bush:
	
	I was pleased to learn that Alan Deserio was among the finalists being forwarded to you for consideration for appointment to Judge Blue's seat on the Second District Court of Appeal.  I will not take time to reiterate his obvious qualifications which appear on his resume.  Instead, I offer some personal observations.

	I have known Alan for several years and have always recognized him as a skilled and perceptive lawyer.  Based on my personal contact with him in cases and in other professional contexts, I also believe he would bring an excellent judicial demeanor to the bench.  He would make a judge that you could be proud to have appointed.

Good to see you at Tropical Park recently. Thought you might like to see the latest Florida Times Union School Voucher editorial. 
Florida Times Union Editorial

Tuesday, February 4, 2003 

LAW: Cleanup time


To uphold the erroneous ruling of a trial court that school vouchers are unconstitutional, the Florida Supreme Court would have to perform incredible exercises in judicial gymnastics. 

Nothing in the state constitution prohibits the opportunity scholarships currently used by hundreds of children to escape from failing public schools. 

A ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court settled the question of whether voucher opponents could rest their hopes on the establishment clause in the U.S. Constitution. They cannot. 

But many states contain a lasting monument to religious intolerance in their state constitutions. Florida is one. 

These provisions, called Blaine amendments, were put in place to block any attempt to aid Catholic schools at a time when many new immigrants to the United States were Catholic and thus, to some, threatening the prevailing Protestant religion. 

The amendment, which prohibits aid "directly or indirectly" to religion, went into the 1885 constitution and continued even through the 1968 revision. 

Opponents claim that parents, when given vouchers they can use at either public or private schools, religious or secular, run afoul of the amendment if they choose a religious school. 

One problem is that the courts already have addressed this point many times and always have interpreted it as allowing a church to get a benefit if that is incidental to the primary reason for the legislation. 

If the Supreme Court were to overturn these prior rulings through some flimsy artifice, the effect would go far beyond school vouchers. 

Any aid to Florida residents that eventually found its way into a church could be banned. 

For example, health care subsidies such as the Healthy Kids program probably could be disallowed if any recipients chose to have health care provided by St. Vincent's Medical Center or Baptist Medical Center. 

Briefs filed by the governor, attorney general and assorted interests including the Pacific Legal Foundation set forth the issues and law with impressive clarity. 

One brief notes that in a 1959 case from Jacksonville, the court called a plaintiff's contention "absurd" -- an unusually strong word -- that "any benefit to a religious group resulting from the use of public property ipso facto constitutes an indirect contribution of public funds." 

The current Supreme Court leans to the left, but the law is clear in this case. No mater what the court rules, however, Florida residents should clean up their constitution by erasing the stain of 19th century intolerance.

National Sheriffs' Association Keeps Spirit of Volunteerism Alive

By Sheriff Tommy Ferrell, President NSA 

February 3, 2003 



In the last year and a half Americans have come together in the defense of freedom. And last week, in his State of the Union Address, President Bush highlighted what has been accomplished on the home front and internationally. 

But there is still work to be done. 

Citizens and law enforcement have made great strides in improving the security of our neighborhoods and our nation since September 11th, 2001, but we must continue to be vigilant. We face a new day in which we realize that our homeland requires the hard work and diligence of all its people to retain the freedoms we treasure and have fought so hard to enjoy. 

Citizen volunteer efforts such as the National Sheriffs' Association's Neighborhood Watch Program fit hand in glove with the additional security measures our government is supporting in our communities, nations airports, borders and waterways. 

What else can local neighborhoods do but be keenly aware of their surroundings in this time of heightened awareness in our nation? And these principles keep with those of Neighborhood Watch and the themes of other community programs such as Triad, which involves senior citizens in our local communities. And, all these programs fall under the highly successful community policing umbrella. 

When the President originally announced a call for volunteerism nationwide, his goal was to involve citizens in our communities in any way they could. What fits better with this than local Neighborhood Watch programs? They are already established and have been for many years. They have worked perfectly for us in law enforcement to protect against all elements of criminal activity, and they will work perfectly now for homeland security. 

Beyond enhancing Neighborhood Watch, citizens in communities across the country have been better preparing themselves for any type of disaster or emergency. Prior to September 11th there was planning in place for disasters, but they are now reworking them in response to the tragedy of that day. 

Some have used great ingenuity as in one jurisdiction where sheriffs' deputies have been trained to respond to terrorist attacks like those we experienced on 9/11. It has caused us to stop, rethink and redraw our plans on a local level and it only enhances local community preparedness. 

And, citizens across this country have shown they are ready to respond. 

We have said for years in Neighborhood Watch programs that in order to be successful you have to go back to the concept of allowing citizens to participate at as high a level as they are willing. If they don't want to report things that are suspicious, it won't work. We want everyone to report things they see and suspect. We are only as strong as our people. 

Citizens and law enforcement have taken on the mantle of responsibility to defend our freedom and our homeland. It is amazing the resolve people have committed themselves to. People are truly ready to meet the challenge and become involved, when you ask them to. The minute you ask them, they want to be heavily involved and feel like they are doing something for this country and the war on terrorism. They are looking for their own ways to participate and Neighborhood Watch gives them that opportunity. 

The President has said that the war on terrorism is not only a matter of security for our nation, but also a fight for the safety and security of all people. One of the things I have noticed is the resolve of Americans to do this, no matter what community you are in. When I make speeches about homeland security it is on the tip of everyone's tongues. I'm making a speech to a large church community next week about homeland security and that would never have happened before September 11th. Things like this are happening everywhere. 

People are not complaining about long lines at the airports and added security measures. They have accepted terrorism as an element that they have to combat in their local communities. 

A Japanese admiral after the attack on Pearl Harbor said, "We have awakened a sleeping giant." That is exactly the feeling now. People of the United States resent it if someone attacks their way of life and their form of government. The President said it well in his State of the Union address that we will be attacking those who attack freedom. That's what this fight is all about.

Hello Jeb: 

Hope all is well with you, wanted to drop you a line to let you know of a request from NASDAQ. They would like to invite you and Columba to their VIP dinner, Saturday March 29, 2003 which will include the CEO's of many of the NASDAQ companies as well as a number of U.S. Congressmen. Wick's thoughts was that it would be a great opportunity for you to welcome the guests to Florida and useful for you to meet the CEO's of some of the high-tech world which you care about. Marilyn and I will be attending so you and Columba would be seated with us as well as Tony Trabert who will be our house guest for that weekend.

Jeb, take care and I look forward to seeing you this weekend.

Subject: Lost Tree Islands


Governor:
 
Yesterday, I signed a deed transferring ownership of the "Lost Tree Islands" to City of Vero Beach, Town of Indian River Shores and Indian River County.  The State of Florida through the FCT provided some of the Funding.  The sale was a friendly condemnation and a bargain sale allowing for tax deductions on the sale.
 
This sale ended 2 of the longest lawsuits in the State of Florida's history, finally resolving a taking issue that started back in 1985.  I was barely out of grad school when it all began.  
 
The owners of Lost Tree agreed to sell their property for substantially less than the appraised value.  The preservation of these islands for the future generations of residents near John's Island, Vero Beach,  which Lost Tree developed, should go down as one of the single biggest charitable grants of the year. Lollie Ecclestone Stone deserves some public thanks in my opinion. 
 
I also want to personally thank you for listening to our cause and our plight as we battled the various groups hoping to "take" our property.  This was a good ending for all and was acheived partially due to your and to the State's help.  After the 4th DCA ruled the governments' action did indeed take our property,  we felt vindicated and half the battle was for the cause of right and private property rights.  If they could do it to us, what could the little individual property owner do against the tyranny of the governments.
 
I will send you some press clippings.  You or parts of your administration should take some credit on this one.  It would be great PR.
 
 
 
Thanks again;

Thiery Kobes' firm, Ajax, built this school and we will be receiving about one million dollars.  This is a monumental achievement for Lake County and your SIT fund program inspired our costs savings. 

Lake County is Jeb Bush country as you know and you honoring us by presenting this award would  be one of the greatest moments ever for education in Lake County.

I copied Tara Wainwright and Brandi Langford but have not received a response. 

We really want you to participate in this great event.  Getting a million dollars back for  completing a high school below state averages in a monumental accomplishment for us.

Subject: Charter Schools follow-up



Dear Governor Bush:

 

State Representative Arza stated that he had met with you today regarding charter schools and asked that I follow up.  I met you on several occasions – last when you visited with a group of attorneys from South Florida at the Biltmore a few months ago.  I’m friends with your former deputy Chief of Staff, Frank Jimenez, and attended law school with his older brother Marc, who’s a great lawyer and one of my best friends. I commend you on the A-plus program and am a strong proponent of quality and accountability in charter schools.  I believe that you’re doing a great job as our Governor.  

 

I’ve served for three years on the Charter School Review Panel (Speaker Feeney appointed me) and have founded several successful charter schools here in South Florida including Mater Academy (K-12 programs in Little Havana and Hialeah Gardens serving close to 2,000 students), Doral Academy (K-12 programs serving almost 2,000 students in the Doral area) and Somerset Academy (K-12 programs serving more than 1,500 students in Southwest Broward County – and one of the first SACS Accredited Charters in the State), the Miami Children’s Museum Charter School (a K-5 program scheduled to open within the new Children’s Museum being built in Watson Island), and the Thelma and Theodore Gibson Charter School (planned for West Coconut Grove).  Both the Mater Academy and Doral Academy programs received recognition awards (and financial awards) from the State this past year under the A-Plus Program.  

 

As Representative Arza mentioned, Mater Academy is a Title-I school that primarily serves students from low income households.  Mater Academy was established six years ago in collaboration with Centro Mater.  Centro Mater has served needy families for more than 30 years and is a recipient of a grant from the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy grant and has been recognized by the Points of Light Foundation.  Mater Academy Charter School has provided Centro Mater’s families the chance to continue their children’s education in a charter school program that offers a rigorous curriculum in a loving and caring environment.  The children have flourished there.  

 

This past year, Mater Academy opened the first high school in Hialeah Gardens with 500 students in grades 6 through 9 (the school will grow through 12th grade during the coming years).  More than 1,000 parents and family members attended the school’s parent night – debunking the myth that low income secondary school parents wouldn’t be as involved as elementary school ones.  Approximately 250 students are enthusiastically attending supplemental academic programs the school offers each Saturday to ensure that they don’t fall behind in their studies.

 

I would like to invite you to visit one of our charter school programs during one of your upcoming visits to South Florida.  I believe that you will be encouraged by the good results that your education initiatives are yielding for parents and students.

 

Regards,

 

Fernando Zulueta

 forcing you to sell one to raise money to pay the tax. The people you
 voted for then take the tax money, buy a cow and give it to your
 neighbor. You feel righteous. Barbara Streisand sings for you

SOCIALIST:

You have two cows. The government takes one and gives it to your
 neighbor. You form a cooperative to tell him how to manage his cow.

REPUBLICAN:

You have two cows. Your neighbor has none. So?

COMMUNIST:

You have two cows. The government seizes both and provides you with
 milk. You wait in line for hours to get it. It is expensive and sour.

CAPITALISM, AMERICAN STYLE:

You have two cows. You sell one, buy a bull, and build a herd of cows.

DEMOCRACY, AMERICAN STYLE:

You have two cows. The government taxes you to the point you have to
 sell both to support a man in a foreign country who has only one cow,
 which was a gift from your government.

BUREAUCRACY, AMERICAN STYLE:

You have two cows. The government takes them both, shoots one, milks the
 other, pays you for the milk, and then pours the milk down the drain.

AMERICAN CORPORATION:

You have two cows. You sell one; lease it back to yourself and do an IPO
 on the second one. You force the 2 cows to produce the milk of four
 cows. You are surprised when one cow drops dead. You spin an
 announcement to the analysts stating you have downsized and are reducing
 expenses. Your stock goes up.

FRENCH CORPORATION:

You have two cows. You go on strike because you want three cows. You go
 to lunch. Life is good.

JAPANESE CORPORATION:

You have two cows. You redesign them so they are one-tenth the size of
 an ordinary cow and produce twenty times the milk. They learn to travel
 on unbelievably crowded trains. Most are at the top of their class at
 cow school.

GERMAN CORPORATION:

You have two cows. You reengineer them so they are all blond, drink lots
 of beer, give excellent quality milk, and run a hundred miles an hour.
 Unfortunately, they also demand 13 weeks of vacation per year.

ITALIAN CORPORATION:

You have two cows but you don't know where they are. While ambling
 around, you see a beautiful woman. You break for lunch. Life is good.

RUSSIAN CORPORATION:

You have two cows. You have some vodka. You count them and learn you
 have five cows. You have some more vodka. You count them again and learn
 you have 42 cows. You count them again and learn you have 12 cows. You
 stop counting cows and open another bottle of vodka. The Mafia shows up
 and takes over how ever many cows you really have.

POLISH CORPORATION:

You have two bulls. Employees are regularly maimed and killed attempting
 to milk them.

FLORIDA CORPORATION:

You have a black cow and a brown cow. Everyone votes for the best
 looking one. Some of the people who like the brown one best vote for the
 black one. Some people vote for both. Some people vote for neither. Some
 people can't figure out how to vote at all. Finally, a bunch of guys
 from out-of-state tell you which is the best-looking one.

NEW YORK CORPORATION:

You have fifteen million cows. You have to choose which one will be the

Subject:	dcf's first step: keep kids in home (thanks for listening)

             Excellent move.  I find with my clients, many of them, that children are removed too quickly. Many times, housing is the big problem. Something happens to make family homeless and momma goes to homeless shelters and guess what happens when she has many children or children of the opposite sex:  in swoops dcf to remove the children.  And guess how they find out.  They get a call from some social worker, of which there are plenty, who think they are doing good for the family. I cannot even count how many times this occurs and has occurred over my 20+ years as a legal aid attorney.  It is disheartening.  Instead of trying to find suitable housing, the children are swept away.  

Another problem:  if there is any spousal abuse and the poor woman does not have the ability to have daddy arrested because he is the sole breadwinner, the police inform dcf and in they swoop to remove the children. Dad then throws momma on the street and that is the end of that story.  Except there are numerous court hearings to take the children away or rather to keep the children in the foster home and nothing is done to re-unite and great harm to the family structure occurs. Do you think the police could remove dad, get him into anger management and leave momma in the apt. No! One reason is that the apt. is in the name of daddy.  Or daddy throws her out of the house and then the hearings start. Such a Mess!

Also, many of the social workers are very young and right out of school, do not have families and have no clue.  I thought one of them was a high school student observing , but she was the case worker. Many are so judgmental and judge according to a "if you dare spank, yell, curse at your children, you are not fit and need parenting classes and until you learn how to respect your child, then child is put into foster care". 

In one case of mine, they placed the little girl in the home of the momma's son who had is very gay and did not have a great relationship with his mother. Why?  Guess. The mom lost her housing and was a woman who was a victim of a one time incident where she was "slapped" by her boyfriend. The father of the child had died of cancer. 

This stuff is absolutely true.  I would sign an affidavit to this.  

I hope you pass this on to Riegler.  He has a head on his shoulders.  Also, he should meet with legal aid attorneys on why his social workers are drastically failing in helping welfare mothers become totally self-sufficient.  They have this attitude that I have shared with you before of "why should I help you get something I never got" so they keep denying benefits which keeps the cycle going.  

If you want anymore info, let me know.

Subject:	IN RE Response to Petition, etc.

Dear Mr. Dunn,
 
Although there are several misstatements of law and fact in your response which I will address in my reply to the court, one statement of law by you appears to be more than a misstatement and, to the contrary, an effort to intentionally mislead the court.  Because I bring this issue to your attention now, if you leave this misrepresentation in the court record without correction, it would clearly be intentional.
 
On page 13 you state:
 
Clearly, according to the Supreme Court of Florida, an administrative judge for the family division, duly designated by the chief judge of the circuit, was empowered to execute administrative orders.  Judge Hess, duly designated by Chief Judge Pittman as Administrative Judge of the Bay County Courthouse, whose responsibilities included courthouse security, was similarly empowered.”
 
In making this claim you cite IN RE REPORT OF COM’N ON FAMILY COURTS, 633 So.2d 14, 17 (Fla. 1994).
 
However, there is no statement whatsoever in that case that says that “an administrative judge for the family division...was empowered to execute administrative orders...”  This is a blatant misrepresentation.
 
In fact, and clearly to the contrary of your misrepresentation, IN RE REPORT OF COM’N ON FAMILY COURTS made no mention whatsoever of this claim.
 
Furthermore, as to the approval of local rules and administrative orders for family matters, IN RE REPORT OF COM’N ON FAMILY COURTS specifically required, as repeatedly addressed in the decision, that these rules and administrative orders be submitted to the Florida Supreme Court for approval.  This requirement, in fact, not only took local approval authority away from the administrative judges, but also from circuit chief judges in family matters.
 
I would certainly concede that Judge Hess or any non-chief judge can sit there all day long until the cows come home and develop and draft administrative orders in relationship to their administrative duties.  However, the critical point is that these administrative judge DO NOT have the authority to “enter and sign” the order for approval and ratification.  This authority to “enter and sign” an administrative order per Rule 2.050(b)(5), and DOJJ v. A.C. Soud 685 So.2d 1376 (Fla. 1st DCA 1997), is restricted to only chief judges.  The chief judge must “sign” the order and also must “enter” the order by filing with the clerk of court.
 
Therefore, the 1st DCA’s 1997 ruling in Soud is undeniably consistent with the Supreme Court’s earlier 1994 decision in site IN RE REPORT OF COM’N ON FAMILY COURTS.
 
As to your argument that a chief judge has authority to delegate authority per Rule 2.050 to appointed administrative judges, I also certainly concede that this is correct.  However, the rule excludes the authority to delegate the authority to “enter and sign” administrative orders and this exception is clearly set forth in the rule and was recognized by the 1st DCA in Soud as an exception.
 
The use of the word “may” in the rule, as opposed to “shall”, also has no import as the Soud interpretation that it means “only.”  The rule clearly provides only that chief judges “may” enter administrative orders.  It does not say administrative judges, circuit judges, county judges, clerks, bailiffs, or any other court personnel “may” enter them.  Common sense would dictate that judicial chaos would arise if any one official in the judicial system could “enter and sign” an administrative order or unilaterally generate and ratify local rules.  By restricting only chief judges to this authority, control over administrative orders can be centralized and controlled avoiding an “administrative Frankenstein” as the term was used and applied in IN RE REPORT OF COM’N ON FAMILY COURTS.  That is why the Supreme Court in that case reserved approval authority at even a higher level in family court administration matters.
 
Lastly, you are clearly ignoring the public records of your own agency in front of you.  In the Soud case the Attorney General argued in its brief to the 1st DCA that approval of the Chief Judge given to Judge A.C. Soud in Jacksonville should extend authority to Judge Soud to “enter and sign” the administrative order in question.
 
The DOJJ attorney responded in his brief that this was not the case and approval or no approval of the chief judge, Judge Soud had no authority to “enter and sign” the administrative order at issue.
 
The 1st DCA rejected your boss’s argument and accepted the argument of DOJJ and still ruled that “only” a “chief judge” can “enter and sign” an “administrative order.”
 
I obtained copies of those briefs from the public records of your agency (AG) and thereby those records are at your fingertips but are being ignored.
 
The bottom line is that the issue has been argued and resolved by the 1st DCA and as you admit, you did not appeal the 1st DCA decision and that decision stands as controlling law in this circuit and district.
 
Even if the DCA did reconsider its earlier Soud decision for possible reversal, you have absolutely provided no authority for the 1st DCA to consider that would warrant such reversal.
 
In your brief you also ignore the fact that Judge Pittman herself entered a proper administrative order in effect in 1997 to the present, adopting Soud, that only she can sign and enter administrative orders unless an administrative judge prepares the order.  But even then, her order still requires that both she and the administrative judge sign the order.  Ignoring this point of law in your brief when it was brought to your attention earlier is also misrepresentation.
 
Therefore, I respectfully request that you notify the 1st DCA of the above misstatements of law and that you are withdrawing your unsupportable claim that “according to the Supreme Court of Florida, an administrative judge for the family division, duly designated by the chief judge of the circuit, was empowered to execute administrative orders.”
 
A government attorney has a duty to ensure justice is done in its courts on behalf of the people, not any one person.  This duty includes the primary duty to truthfully represent the law and facts.  That is not happening in this case as illustrated above.
 
Please respond by email stating if you are willing to correct the misrepresentations addressed herein.

p.s. furthermore you refer to me as a “litigant” as to disruption allegations.  This is also misrepresentation because at no time related to the Hess administrative order was I acting as a “litigant” so any citations to cases that address the activities of “disruptive litigants” are irrelevant to this case.  At all times I was acting in a capacity as a witness or private citizen in relationship to the Sundancer cases or as a private citizen accessing public records or challenging improper Grand Jury or other activities of the Clerk of Court.  All cases you cited

Federal government got lots of taxes from crooked corporate executives that got rich by abusing their position.
 
Investors lost millions.
 
SIMPLE SOLUTION TO SHOW GOVERNMENT TAKES RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS AUTHORIZED AND CREDENTIALED AUDITORS* FAILURE TO DO THEIR JOB IS FOR BROTHER GEORGE TO PROPOSE THAT INVESTORS WHO LOST MONEY IN COMPANY WHERE ANY "FIDUCIARY"  (auditor, executive, board,etc) PERSONALLY PROFITED WHERE FINANCIALS DIDN'T ACCURATELY REFLECT FINANCES OF COMPANY (whether fraud found or merely market moving restatement).  THAT SUCH INVESTORS BE ALLOWED TO TAKE 100% TAX CREDIT FOR TOTAL OF LOSSES AGAINST CURRENT AND PREVIOUS TAXES PAID.   The cost of such tax savings would be "counterbalanced" by taxes collected from executive profits and wages.    
 
IN ESSENCE, THIS WOULD RESULT IN TAXES PAID ON ILL GOTTEN PROFITS BEING RETURNED TO HARMED INVESTORS WITH BROTHER GEORGE AS THE "BEARER OF LOSSES RECOVERED".      ........... and since many of those harmed the most were "middle American's invested in their company plan .... seems Democrats would want to see that money transferred from "the wealthy crooks" to the workers and other investors they harmed.
 
AND THE SAME SHOULD APPLY TO ALL RESTITUTION PAID BY THOSE CHARGED WITH FRAUD/ MISREPRESENTATION ..... imagine the dollars many states would see that could be spent in their states by millions of damaged investors.

Interesting article in Forbes magazine, pg 40, issue dated 2/17/03 by author of “Schools that do too much”.   

 

HER PROPOSITION FOR IMPROVING SCHOOLS :   privatize extracurricular activities and remove all but basic academic studies from the classroom.    A study she did found that while 5% of the school budget OFFICIALLY fell in non-academic section, real costs were closer to 10%.

 

ALSO, did you see what is being done in Lebanon PA.     PARENTAL REPORT CARD grading parents on things like attendance at parent teacher conferences, whether they return things they have to sign and whether their children come to school healthy and properly dressed.   YOU KNOW PARENTS ARE THE KEY TO CHILDREN’S SUCCESS.   A teacher with only 7 kids in a class would only have 1 hour a day to devote to the child vs 8 hours a day or more, plus summers and weekends, for parents.    

 

Imagine a system that could track grades, parental involvement, attendance, on a simple chart you could view each month to see if there is a pattern ……..

Governor Bush,

I am writing this email with the hope that you will assist me. I have
had problems receiving my monthly child support payments. There are
months that I receive the payments and then there are months that I
don't receive it in a timely manner. I have been informed by the state
employees that there is another woman that is receiving my support
payments. This is the fourth time that someone else has received the
check. To further add to the frustration is the fact that I have been
informed that this will happen again and that there is nothing that
they
can do about it. I don't understand, I thought  the system was setup
to
assist people trying to raise their children. My ex-husband had done
his
part by having the money withdrawn from his pay check. He is trying to
assist in the raising of his children. I wish that this money was not
needed in my household but, it truly is needed. I work as a para -
professional and also have a second job. Because of the system my
monthly expenditures are behind. Every month I go though the same fear
that my child support check will be sent to the wrong person again. I
have called and spoke to them only then to  be told to call someone
different, never receiving assistance from anyone. Your assistance
would
be greatly appreciated.

	GREEN  meant  average percent  (AS SET BY YOUR EXPERTS)		
	YELLOW meant BELOW average percent				
									
									
Even without knowing the actual grades, or student name, you could "infer" 	
certain possible conclusions from this SIMPLE DISPLY			
	Class size is below average						
	Student 1 has poor attendance, poor parent participation, but still did above average

		in spite of other factors and worth some special encouragement)		
	student 2 has parental participation, good attendance, but could the yellow indicate	
		he/she freezes at "major exams".				
	Student 3 parents don't attend conferences, but apparently help with homework.  Coud	
		it be they work long hours and just can't get away,. Maybe a Saturday	
		meeting could be arranged, or a phone call. Also, could higher class grade be	
		indication of cheating, or another "big exam" freeze case		
	student 4 indicates strong parental involvement, but below average grades.  Even with	
		above average attendance.  MAYBE NEEDS DIFFERENT TEACHING 	
		METHOD OR TUTOR					
									
OVERALL:, for this class, you would know that in spite of it being below average in size, the	
	FCAT results are below average, that parental involvement is mixed, that in class	
	grades are higher than FCAT which could mean students freeze at major tests	
	or maybe internal grades are inflated …. And so on.				
									
Now, look at the charts below.  Even if you didn't know the name of the school, the actual class 	
size, the name of the kids, the finances of the parents, COULDN'T YOU EASILY TELL WHICH	
CLASSES HAD GOOD / BAD PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT, WHICH CLASSES HAD GOOD 	
"CLASS" GRADES BUT POOR "THIRD PARTY GRADES" (ie maybe inflated grades), whether	
class size or parental involvement had more effect on FCAT, etc

Malpractice report shocks state

By Mark Hollis | Tallahassee Bureau 
Posted February 7, 2003 


TALLAHASSEE -- It was posted on the Internet for only a few hours, but a research paper from a conservative Washington group citing Florida's medical-malpractice laws as the nation's best triggered a reaction of utter surprise in Tallahassee, where a legislative fight is brewing over malpractice insurance.

Advocates and critics of plans to revamp Florida's laws on health-care lawsuits said they never would have imagined that The Heritage Foundation would endorse the Sunshine State's malpractice laws.

However, that's what happened, at least for part of a day last week, before an embarrassed new staff member at the national political think tank was chastised by his bosses for having "misinterpreted" the data he collected.

"As you might imagine, all sorts of hell broke loose," said Derek Hunter, who penned the study.

Had the report by The Heritage Foundation, which Gov. Jeb Bush's administration frequently cites as a source of credible information, not been revised, some Florida health-care lobbyists said their lobbying efforts could have been frustrated, if not stalled.

Trial attorneys, who make money from malpractice lawsuits and are vigorously working to stop any changes to the system, thought they had hit a political jackpot when the foundation's report appeared early Jan. 28.

Six hours later, though, the report was rewritten, dropping Florida from the foundation's highest-ranked status to a "failing" grade for having malpractice laws that the group views as too liberal.

"Florida went from A-plus to D-minus in less than 24 hours," said Scott Carruthers, executive director of the Academy of Florida Trial Lawyers.

Hunter called it a "rookie mistake."

"The Playground and School Financing"
by Donna Garner
February 7, 2003
 
It is not just Title I money that wasn't counted into a school district's financial base when Texas' Robin Hood plan for school funding was created. There are literally hundreds of federal programs and state grants which flow to school districts. It seems only prudent to add them in as income BEFORE the state decides how much to dole out to each school district; and so far as I can determine, these federal/state funds and grants were never added into the calculations.
 
Let's apply this situation to a preschool playground. If Child A has 10 lollipops that are given to him, it is not fair to take away Child B's 1 lollipop and give it to Child A who now ends up with 11 lollipops while Child B ends up with 0. This would cause Child A to be wasteful with his 11 lollipops while it causes Child B to be resentful toward Child A.

Mr. Hane will bring to the group the benefit his long experience in Spanish language television and commercial production, and represent that important sector well. As you know, in South Florida in particular, the Spanish language segment of the industry is extremely important, and to date we have not had anyone on the Council that adequately represented those interests. I think the addition of Mr. Hane will help rectify this oversight.

Letter to the FAMUAN re Slavery Reparations: Word Count=290, not counting Greeting or Contact DATA. Cc: Jeb Bush

Dear Jason Hutchins and Courtney Culmer:

I was impressed at the good balance FAMU has taken in providing columnists for opposing views on the matter of reparations for slavery of Africans in early North America (Feb 07 issue of the FAMUAN).

To begin with, Jason, I would like to express my thanks for your standing up for your principles in opposition to many other Black Americans who feel reparations are due. In your defense, I would like to cite Ezekiel 18:20a, of the King James Version of the Bible, which says: "The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son."

This would seem to oppose Courtney's good article, and in fact, I oppose her opinion in principle myself, but she is right: Some reparations are needed, but I would like to suggest that the "reparations" she mentions go to persons of *any* race who are impoverished and trying to struggle. This would truly embody the American way of pursuing our freedoms - and the view of many religions, which seek to help the less fortunate.

Courtney, to you I would say that Jason has a point in his suggestion that some problems may be our fault as individuals, and implore you to not worry about affirmative action: We minorities (I am part American Indian) have flourished, as Gov Jeb Bush promised, after his abolishment of certain affirmative action set-asides, replaced by "affirmative action" for poverty or merit/achievement.

Once again, thank you for writing good articles: I think it would be nice if every American had at least four (4) Acres and a mule: This would help fulfil President George W. Bush's goal of every American having home ownership.

As a new member of a School's Advisory Council,  I have noticed that if a parent asks too many questions on what is actually going on within the school, you are denigrated by those selected by the teachers and administrators.  There is a predetermined agenda already in place set for the School Advisory Council.  Parents really have no input.    The School Advisory Council is there to give the illusion that there is input from the community and parents.
 
I fully support Governor Bush and his stand on trying to make the Schools Accountable, however,  when you have an education system which wants to protect it's own, it is very hard to for changes to occur.  I happen to live in a School District (Volusia County) in which the School Board wants to blame the Governor and Legislature for all the problems in our schools and constantly complains that their lack of funds is the fault of Tallahassee.

Sir, I had an interesting experience at yesterday's Faculty Meeting, after 
school. I signed a petition promulgated by the UTD Stewards which proposed 
that the State of Florida take over insurance negotiations for all of 
Florida's school districts to negotiate one package deal for all schools. 

This sounds like a superb idea!  

I say this because we teachers here in Miami-Dade lobbied hard to get the 
school board to get United Health as our insurer....which was done this year 
only to find that some specific surgical and non-surgical procedures were 
bargained away...like the one which could PROLONG MY LIFE!

My doctors tell me I NEED Gastric Bypass to alleviate my advanced Sleep 
Apnea, potential for heriditary diabetes, and a possible heart disease 
starting.....but UNITED HEALTH won't cover this because the stupid board 
members bargained it away...althouth United routinely covers it for other 
companies.  

I think this borders on criminal negligence.  

Is it possible the State could negotiate a better deal for ALL teachers in 
the state, which would be a potential boon to the smaller, poorer counties 
and a feather in your cap?
Jim Kononoff

PS I will possibly try to fund the $20,000 procedure on my own, because I 
have no choice. This is not cosmetic surgery for me...it's LIFE and DEATH.

Her background in health care publishing and marketing gives her a broad understanding of our health system.

Dear Governor Bush,

I was thrilled to see the article in the Palm Beach Post "Bush predicts 
online version of FCAT" and how "a computerized version of the test has also 
been promised next year to students with disabilities."  THANK YOU SO MUCH!

I'm hoping to talk to Shan this week about my Michael doing a presentation on 
the Web-based Assessment and the benefits that can be experienced by students 
with disabilities at Family C.A.F.E...thought you would approve.

Also, we're planning on being in DC the week of February 17 - 21, and will be 
discussing your initiatives here in Florida including the BRTF Report, and of 
course Web-based Assessment.  Michael McNally from Vantage is working on this 
presentation to the folks from ELC and hopefully either Paige or Hickok will 
be in attendance...any chance that you are going to be in DC that week?  :-)

This is a VERY exciting time and I can't tell you how great it feels to have 
"our kids"  (ESE students) leading the way! Thank you again for your 
commitment to education and your advocacy.

From the Heart,

Dear Brett,

Thank you for scheduling a conference call meeting next Tuesday with Florida's Washington, D.C. office to discuss the RFP submitted by Sunol Molecular Corporation on December 20, 2002.  Last year, over $1 billion was allocated to the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease, one of the National Institutes of Health, for defense against biological bioterrorism agents.  Over 32 NIAID RFPs were announced for dispersement of these funds in response to their research agenda.  This year, the President proposed $5.9 billion for NIH bioterrorism programs of which an additional $1.2 billion in biodefense funding is targeted for NIAID alone.  We have an excellent opportunity in Florida to respond and procure awards from several of these RFPs, thereby leveraging the expertise of our universities and industry, growing and strengthening the infrastructure needed to support biotechnology in Florida, and assisting in the Homeland Securities effort.  We appreciate the Governor's enthusiasm for this effort and willingness to help us.  These efforts will pave the way for advocacy as other RFP contracts are sought from the State.

Attached are two documents that provide background for the discussions on Tuesday:  1) an RFP Fact Sheet that we prepared to summarizes the project and key information regarding our submission and 2) a summary of the NIAID Biodefense Research Agenda for 2003.  Please let me know if you need any additional materials.

Best regards,
Claire

Madeleine,  thank you for your call on this matter earlier this week.  I called Omar Franco, Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart's aide, this morning.  Ironically, he was just getting ready to go into a meeting with David Struhs about 6D.  Franco told me that Mario is strongly in the court of the 8.5 SMA residents.  He offered the comment with such conviction that I believe it.
 
Obviously Struhs is an emissary of the Governor.  If there is any way to give some additional support to Mario to counter  whatever he and/or his staff heard today and further butress the other key house members (who I would think Struhs would be trying to see since he made the trip), that might be worthwhile.
 
I sent a copy of my latest letter to Mario, but I forgot to tell Franco that I had done so.  A call to Franco reminding him that it is there or sending another copy might also be worthwhile.  Sorry I can't do it, but my secretary is out this week, and I am on deadline on a brief again.
 
Good luck.

Thank you for your message.  I'm truly sorry that you feel I have been of little help to you and others, since I am here to be of service. I do not approve of any type of mistreatment or neglect of inmates entrusted to the department's custody, and I do what I can to see that this does not occur. It is true that I do not personally go to institutions and check out inmate problems; however, that does not mean that I am not concerned and that I do not care. 
 
I cannot do anything about problems that your son, Daymond, may have had in the past that have already been reviewed. As I told you in prior messages, those issues will not be reviewed again. If you and other parents of prisoners have complaints or problems that have not been previously reviewed or investigated, please tell me, and I will see that your issues are forwarded to the appropriate staff and attempt to have the issues resolved. Of course, I know that you are aware that inmates also have an inmate grievance procedure to use to voice their complaints. 
 
I'm sorry that I cannot always give you the answers that you would like to receive, but please believe that I do care and empathize with those who have sons and daughters in Florida prisons.

Dear Judy:
We as parents of prisoners are given your name as a person to contact help and aid to families of inmates. You have not been given the ability to be of help but instead act as a buffer for the prison system so they do not to have to deal with the concerns of parents and families of the incarcerated. 

I believe I have stated to Secretary Crosby and Governor Bush that when our concerns are sent to you, it is like being sent to a dead letter file.  

I find it very sad for families to have no one to turn to for help with problems and concerns of their loved ones that are incarcerated. 

Having no one that cares about the welfare of our sons and daughters, will be one of the issues that we discuss in our parents of prisoners group.

I am the Executive Director of the Dr. Bruce Heiken Memorial Fund, Inc. We provide free comprehensive eye health/vision examinations & eyeglasses to financially disadvantaged children in Miami-Dade County Public schools. Over the last 10 years we have provided services to more than 15,000 children. For the past 5 years we have had a wonderful collaborative working relationship with Jeppesen VisionQuest. They supply 99% of the eyeglasses to the children we examine. The thought that you could even consider cutting them from the state budget is incomprehensible to me. One of your platforms is education, FCAT, etc. You can cram FCAT studying down a child's throat all you like but if they cannot see the work they are expected to learn they will still fail the exam. Please reconsider this budget cut & put Jeppesen VisionQuest back in the state budget. And, while you're at it make it mandatory for all students to get a complete, comprehensive vision examination before entering school each year. On par with vaccinations. Thank for your attention, Mimi A. Budd.

Hi Erma
 
Information came to me yesterday that a DEP volunteer at Suwannee River State Park said he was very close to taking over Madison Blue Springs.  He also said that I got him in trouble with Bob Ballard and he almost lost his "job."  I don't know what that really means.  The guy's name is Clyde, and he says he lives at Suwanne River State Park.  I can't verify that. He also says that he is the one who has been monitoring Madison Blue. My only concern with this guy is that he is working in the Park, and I would like to know, if this is why I might not be getting referrals.  
 
I called Steve Yoczic, the manager at Suwannee River State Park, today and had a very good conversation with him.  I told him that I didn't want Clyde being mad at me for something Bob Ballard allegedly said. These volunteers are important, since they interact with the park guests, and I would like a good relationship with them for referrals, etc.  
 
Mr. Yoczic was very helpful and is going to talk to Clyde to see what exactly he is talking about.  In addition, Mr. Yoczic was very helpful.  Apparently, Clyde has been tellng people he is going to get a residence at Madison Blue.  That doesn't concern me, since I happen to know the whole site goes under water during floods.  What it does tell me is that Clyde doesn't know the area.  However, I have to be cautious with anybody associated with Parks, because of the history of playing politics with me and other small businesses in the area.  Frankly, it is a little early in the game for anybody to discuss Madison Blue, since there isn't even a "bid" out on it yet.  I am closely watching Park activities and personel, since the past politics of this group has not favored projects or businesses west of the Withlacoochee and the Suwannee Rivers.  Additionally, the political retribution against west bank businesses and individuals is still ongoing by Park staff, because of our support of the Governor.  We are quite use to this, but we will continue to keep this issue in the fore with Governor Bush.  We still work towards cooperation with this Park District, which is administered from Gainesville.  However, the situation will only improve, when the majority of the staff in this district is either re-assigned to other areas of the State or leave through attrition and any other means we can get changes.  
 
The Water Management has been a major patron to Parks and other favored individuals and businesses on the east bank, so this will also have to be addressed in Tallahassee.  The exclusion of our businesses on the west bank can no longer be ignored.  Large capital spending by the SRWMD has greatly contributed to the very political situation in this Park District.  Of course, the bulk of this spending has only benefited the east banks of the Suwannee and Withlacoochee Rivers.

   Our terrorized neighborhood needs help. Where can we find any help to

We have one family leaving here which would like in their own words to regulate 
and control this neighborhood. We can not let our children play on the
road in our subdivision, we can not walk our daily walks in peace without
this family harassing us. We are mostly young people working daily and
can not afford a Counselor for $10,000.00 which it would take to get any

Sorry for my broken  English, I'm just a foreign born citizen. But in need
for a quiet and nice neighborhood since I'm the oldest I feel compelled to

What is relly sad is that the male in this home is employed by the FFA and

Re: Governor Bush's emphasis on diversifying Florida's economy 

Dear Economic Development Colleague, 

In his address to the Enterprise Florida board several weeks ago, Governor Bush emphasized that the diversification of Florida’s economy would occupy a higher profile during his second term.  To that end, he asked me, with incoming Secretary of State and Community Partnerships, Glenda Hood, to co-chair a statewide strategic plan along with Enterprise Florida President and CEO Darrell Kelley.  

I share the Governor’s belief that workforce development and economic development are inextricably linked and I believe that we are all working toward a common goal.  To that end, I want your voices to be heard and your concerns articulated in a strategic plan to diversify Florida’s economy.  I would encourage each of you to contact me to share your ideas.  I need and value your input. 

Please contact me by email at  <mailto:Susan.Pareigis@awi.state.fl.us> Susan.Pareigis@awi.state.fl.us or by telephone at (850) 245-7298. 

Sincerely, 
Susan Pareigis, Director 
Agency for Workforce Innovation 


(Below is the Governor's press release) 

GOVERNOR BUSH STRESSES DIVERSIFICATION THAT WILL STRENGTHEN FLORIDA'S ECONOMY 


Thursday, January 30, 2003 




TALLAHASSEE - Meeting with the Enterprise Florida Board of Directors, Governor Jeb Bush today laid out a cornerstone of his plan to diversify Florida's economy - a priority of the Governor’s during his second term in office. The Governor, who is Chairman of the Enterprise Florida Board, called on the group to join him in taking a focused, ownership role in guaranteeing a team approach to further the state’s economic development efforts. 




“During these tough economic times, Florida has been fortunate that we’ve been able to create new jobs and we’ve remained fiscally sound,” said Governor Bush. “We can and must do better to guarantee a brighter outlook for Florida. One of my top priorities is the diversification of our job market. Accomplishing this goal will require a team effort. I have raised the level of my commitment. I will call five chief executive officers of corporations every week to encourage them to invest or expand in Florida, or just merely to thank them for their presence here.” 




During the transition from the first to second Bush Administration, the Economic Development Transition Team made several recommendations to the Governor including continued reliance on the Enterprise Florida public-private partnership. The Governor has also decided to retain all economic development programs under his Office of Tourism, Trade, and Economic Development. In addition, Governor Bush has accepted a recommendation by Enterprise Florida and the Transition Team to step up the statewide strategic planning process to place a higher profile on economic diversification. Because of the importance of workforce development and growth management to economic development, the Governor has designated Secretary Susan Pareigis of the Agency for Workforce Innovation and incoming Secretary of State and Community Partnerships, Glenda Hood, to co-chair the statewide strategic plan along with Enterprise Florida President and CEO Darrell Kelley.




The Governor will also focus on growing the unique strength industries including international trade, space and defense, and building upon emerging technologies. He laid out four priorities that have the potential to create greater economic diversity for Florida: 




Securing Miami as the Permanent Secretariat for the Free Trade Area of the Americas, which will create an era of prosperity to the region and our state. The Governor recently appointed former Ambassador Charles Cobb to head-up the state effort.




Protecting Florida's military bases from the next round of base closures scheduled for 2005. Governor Bush will soon announce a leadership team assigned to protect our military bases and defense industry.




Continued commitment to creating the Centers of Excellence proposed last year by Governor Bush. The Florida Board of Education will give final approval for the $30 million program next month. The Centers of Excellence will create research cores and build commercial clusters around them.




“We have a remarkable business climate in Florida. In December, our state created nearly 62,000 new jobs compared to a year ago. We can do better. And we will, working together as a team,” Governor Bush noted.

Textbook bill proposes interesting innovation


(c) St. Petersburg Times
published February 7, 2003 

They share many of the same constituents, as well as their political party's philosophy of less government and fewer taxes. 

But some might say that's where the similarities end for state Rep. David Russell Jr. and Sen. Mike Fasano. Russell is soft-spoken and works best behind the scenes. Fasano is intense and often leading the charge. 

But as the veteran legislators from the North Suncoast prepare for the legislative session that opens in Tallahassee in less than a month, Russell and Fasano are bookends. Or, perhaps more precisely, book enders. 

Russell and Fasano, whose districts include parts of Hernando and Pasco counties, are sponsoring a bill that has the potential to save school districts there hundreds of thousands of dollars each year. If the pilot program they propose results in the savings some School Board members predict, it could be expanded statewide. 

State law currently mandates that school districts purchase all Department of Education-approved textbooks from a single private vendor, the Florida School Book Depository in Jacksonville. The books are approved and purchased in five-year cycles. 

But when a book is lost or damaged, school boards are required to replace it with a new book and at the initial purchase price, usually $50 or more. 

By not depreciating the value of books that have been in print for a few years, and not allowing school districts to purchase used or refurbished books, the state is wasting money, according to Russell and Fasano. 

The bill the legislators have filed would exempt Hernando and Pasco counties from that requirement, allowing the two school districts to seek their own vendors at reduced costs. Hernando County administrators predict annual savings of $300,000, and the estimated windfall could reach $1-million for Pasco. 

It remains to be seen whether this is the best way to approach the problem and the collective savings are as expected. It may turn out that the depository's prices are a bargain or that the quality of the used textbooks might be unacceptable to teachers and students. 

The savings from this measure pale compared with the unfunded educational needs facing the state. Legislators are going to need additional ideas beyond buying secondhand books to meet their commitments. 

But Russell and Fasano deserve credit for trying something new and for listening to the pleas of school board members in their districts. Without the insight and persistence of local school leaders, this entrenched process would not have been subject to scrutiny.

Dear Gov Jeb: 

So glad you blasted Sen Nelson for his self-serving, disingenuous comments about the "Bush administration" slashing NASA funding!  So sad to try to make political points out of such a horrible tragedy for those families and for our country. 

The President has led and nurtured admirably during the Columbia horror, especially his 1st speech from the White House where he quoted from Prophet Isaiah about God knowing all the stars and there too the souls of our astronauts called home.    
I looked all through Isaiah for the quotation "Lift your eyes and look to the heavens..." 
but failed to find it.  I should read it through...but, I'm lazy.  Would you happen to know the chapter?  I know, better that I look for it myself..... 

With terror alert now high/orange, our prayers are for vigilance and safe-keeping for us all.   

Regards, Lorraine

Jeb

Didn't know if you had seen this yet (attached)---I am excited about the potential with this.  For too long Carl Perkins and Tech Prep funds--in my opinion--as well as the School To Work program failed as a direct result of not focusing and linking these critical skills for our students directly to student achievement. I have worked with each of these programs for many years--and these are my own conclusions based on my entrenchment with these programs--and as you can see from the statements below in this mass e-mail I got, I do not fit with the mainstream thoughts on the subject.  Yes--we can buy lots of equipment for programs--and I have personally designed, built  many vo tech programs using all of these funds over the past 15 years. Yes--they have done a great deal of good for many kids--but we can do more. I can also tell you that in my opinion -- we need good High School programs that blend strong academics with technical skills--like our State of Florida Technology Studies programs. I do hope these proposed changes to these funds do not hurt these programs. These programs could and should be the central focus and hub of a schools curriculum and the focal point of each students program of study. However those programs need achievement levels measured as well.  Many Florida School Districts spend way too much money (Perkins and Tech Prep) on expensive (300,000.00 plus dollars) canned curriculums and labs for those programs that do not meet the needs of High School Students --such as the Pathways programs (http://www.pitsco-pathways.com/) lots of flash for lots of cash. Again--just my own opinion. One of our most successful programs for Tech Studies in Florida is at Palm Bay High School (not a canned curriculum package)--taught by Mr. Burlew--it is designed around the Florida Technology Student Association activities and standards.  While I think they even could be made more stringent--it is a great model.

I am especially excited about the programs of study for each student highlighted in the new proposed Secondary and Technical Education Act.  This is where Carl Perkins, School to Work and Tech Prep itself failed--again--just my own opinion -- because they never made a strong link to student achievement. We are in the process of setting 2,000 plus students at Bayside HS in Palm Bay with their own personalized electronic individual program of study personally reviewed one on one with their counselors. Due to your help--we have a DOE representative coming to visit us Feb 21 with the counselors to see what we are up to! My motto is--Undecided is OK--Clueless is not!

We in Florida will continue to show the rest of the country how to do things right--even voting :-)


Take care
Matt

BTW--I caught a little bit of Florida's First Lady on the Today Show this week--she is doing a great thing by getting out there and getting good info out--especially about knowing where--what--and with whom your child is with and doing at all times.  I am sure that wasn't easy for her either.

	NASDCTEc LEGISLATIVE ALERT

	

	***URGENT ACTION NEEDED***

	

	PRESIDENT PROPOSES TO DECIMATE PERKINS IN FY 2004!

	

	After weeks and months of waiting, the career technical education community now knows how the Administration plans to reauthorize Perkinsits plan essentially turns Perkins into a funding stream that is ripe for block granting with Title I to improve student achievement! If states decide not to block grant these funds with Title I, funds would be awarded competitively to Local Education Agencies and to community and technical colleges that partner with high schools and businesses. 
	 
	Today, the White House unveiled its fiscal year 2004 budget proposal that includes a funding blueprint for all Federal programs and an overview of its plans for Perkins reauthorization. What the Presidents plan makes clear is that his Administration just doesnt understand the value of career technical education!
	 
	These are the numbers for career technical education:

	In a proposal that would decimate career technical education, the Administration is proposing to eliminate the bulk of the existing Perkins programs in order to create a new Secondary and Technical Education State Grants Program that would be funded at a level of $1 billion and would be charged with improving student achievement, with accountability systems to monitor and report on student performance and resources to create high-quality end-of-course high school exams. While all of the details of this new grant program are not available yet, states could opt to block grant this money for Title I activities. If states decide not to block grant these funds with Title I (which traditionally is under-funded), state grant money would be transferred competitively from the state to Local Education Agencies and to community and technical colleges that partner with local high schools and the business community. The only existing program that would be kept is the Tribally Controlled Postsecondary Vocational Institutions program, which would be moved to the higher education side of the U.S. Education Departments budget. The summary is available at: http://www.ed.gov/offices/OUS/Budget04/04summary/section2c.html <http://www.ed.gov/offices/OUS/Budget04/04summary/section2c.html> .
	 
	Given the outline of the Administrations proposal, this money is to be used to support students transitions from high school to college and college to the workforce. This strategy ignores an entire population of students who need to work their way through their postsecondary education or those who want to work first as they determine which postsecondary major would suit their personal goals. The secondary and technical education plan as envisioned by the Administration assumes that every child will thrive in a high-stakes environment built around passing an end-of-high-school exam.  Instead, the Administrations strategies will LEAVE EVEN MORE CHILDREN BEHIND!
	 
	We know that career technical education equips our students with the skills necessary to either engage in a postsecondary educational experience or enter the workforce after high school. One of the highlights of this system is the EXISTING focus on integration of technical and academic skills in high school curricula, which has yielded documented, positive results, particularly for disadvantaged students.
	 

	ACTION NEEDED!!


	

	It is important now more than ever, that you contact your legislators and seek their support for career technical education. In addition, it will be important to ask them to voice their displeasure with the Administration. The Administrations plan ignores the progress that the career technical education system has been making to implement the reforms specified during the last reauthorization. It also ignores the long-term, positive effect that career technical education has on students!
	 
	ACTION NEEDED: To save the valuable features of career technical education, please either visit, call, fax, or e-mail your legislator today to let them know that Perkins programmatic functions are in jeopardy for fiscal year 2004.
	 
	Specifically, let them know:
	 
	v     The Administrations FY 2004 Budget Proposal outlines Perkins reauthorization plans that would eliminate the federal investment in career technical education as we know it and create a block grant for high schools.
	 
	                                Ask your legislators to oppose this plan; and
	                                Ask your legislators to urge the Administration to reconsider its plans to eliminate Perkins and create a block 
	                                 grant  program with the potential of losing any focus on career technical education.  
	                                 CTEs FUTURE DEPENDS ON  YOU!
	 
	To call your legislator, you can phone the U.S. Capitol Switchboard at 202-224-3121 and ask for your Member. In addition, you can view contact information online for House and Senate members at www.house.gov <http://www.house.gov/>  and www.senate.gov <http://www.senate.gov/> , respectively.

Governor Bush,
 
No problem about the phone calls and emails, I think some of them on my answering machine are actually pretty funny.  I eventually hope to possibly go to medical school and get into oncology so that I can help people and hopefully irradicate cancer and other diseases.  We in the science community are very grateful that the President made the tough decision to allow research with some stem cell lines and that he did it in such a way as to not encourage people to get abortions to do it.  I am a big believer that when we have children we should all be freezing our cord blood stem cells such that God forbid we ever have a genetic defect later in life that we will have an ample supply of stem cells for cutting-edge research, which will make the whole ethical issue disappear, while still allowing the science to advance and help people.  Are there any other programs in Florida such as the Endeavor program that foster an interest in young people from historically disadvantaged backgrounds?  I enjoy teaching and seeing that twinkle of wonderment in their eyes and I know many other graduate students just like me who would be very happy to assist in the development of more such programs if they don’t already exist to encourage such a noble cause.
 
Thank you,
 
Jeff Bush

Subject: FCAT Exemption


Dear Governor Bush:

The attached letter is a petition for exemption from the graduation test requirements (FCAT) under State Board of Education Administrative Rules Chapter 6A-1.09431 for Heather Anne Henslee.  Our daughter is disabled under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and may not graduate from her high school with a diploma even though she has a 3.0 GPA.  She has only lived in Florida since July, 2002.

Heather is a cancer survivor.  She was diagnosed with Acute Milogeneous Leukemia (AML) when she was four years old.  She had her first bone marrow transplant at the age of five and was in remission for eighteen months.  She was then diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL).  She received a second bone marrow transplant which included radiation to her brain and spinal fluid, in addition to full body radiation and chemotherapy, when she was seven years old.  Even though the treatment cured her from cancer, she has suffered from learning disabilities and physical damage.

According to the current graduation requirements, Heather will not receive a diploma unless she passes the math portion of this high stakes test without a waiver of the requirement.  How can this be allowed to happen to a child who has earned a 3.0 GPA?  Heather has overcome a life-threatening illness, continues to suffer from the side effects, and now has to endure the additional stress and pressure to pass the FCAT.  Heather dreams to attend college so that one day she can help people who are sick.  This will not happen if she can't pass the math portion of this test.   Heather feels discriminated against because of her academic skill and that she is being punished for the damage that her illness caused to her body.  Her entire future hinges on this one test.  Heather needs to be able to realize her dreams and desires just like everyone else.  The saddest part of this situation is that Heather was forced to move to Florida with her family from California where she had already met the graduation requirements.  The State should not punish her for surviving two life threatening illnesses.

We appreciate your careful consideration of the attached petition and look forward to hearing from you about a waiver for Heather.

Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

William and Margaret Henslee

I was listening to the news tonight and an officer with the Hillsborough
Sheriff's department was saying how 25 deputies have already been called
up as reservists for military duty, and how the department is being
stretched thin. I was wondering if anyone has thought about establishing
a temporary reservist kind of program for the law enforcement in
Florida. This would allow retired law enforcement to volunteer to come
back in times such as this when we are at Orange and help with low key
jobs such as desk jobs and freeing the current officers to do more
strenous things.  It could be set up along the lines of a "Dad's Army"
which we had in Britain during WWII, when retired military took over the
duties of patrolling and securing the coastlines and towns, and members
of the public volunteered to be in the civil defense. Of course, you may
already have such a program, but I was just thinking.

Subject: Senior Citizen Job Fair


Governor Bush:

The senior citizen population of Palm Beach County has
a great deal to offer to prospective employers. We
have the experience to handle any job, we are used to
"showing up" for work every day that we are expected
and on time. We are no longer looking for careers but
meaningful work instead. We need no expensive health
care benefits and we don't look for promotion or
overly hefty paychecks. In short, we are the ideal
candidates for business.

In today's economy, most seniors would relish the
opportunity to increase the bottom line and not have
to rely on a continually shrinking fixed income. We
are talking about employment that is not just busy
work but instead will help the employer achieve
financial success and also feed the Florida economy.

I am interested in applying for a demonstration grant
for Palm Beach County. I will be working hand in hand
with the Area Agency on Aging, AARP, local chambers of
commerce and Florida Workforce Development.

This project will take about nine months to plan and
execute. If successful as I envision, it could easily
be replicated in other parts of the state.

I have many years of experience running large job
fairs, primarily the Broward County Job Fair for nine
years. We had the great pleasure of being awarded a
designation as one of the best 100 programs in the
nation by President Ronald Reagan.

Thank you for your attention to this information. I
will look forward to hearing from someone in your
office.

Dear Governor Bush (Jeb):

When we last met, you asked me to send to you information as to how you would reduce Defined Benefit type plan costs in the future for State employees while increasing more of a dependence on Defined Contribution Plans without making it an all or nothing proposition.  The document I had sent to you is what I had the South Broward Hospital District draft to describe the approach.  The key point relative to the ability to decrease future Defined Benefit increases (reductions of future significant liabilities) and including the increases in Retirement Benefits is through Defined Contribution vehicles.  While your approach for the State would not be the same, the concept would be similar.

I just returned from a lengthy trip to Vail and I hadn't heard from you, so I wanted to check in with you to see if you had a chance to review the package I had sent to you?  If yes, I would be interested in your comments.  If you would like me to have another copy sent to you, please let me know and I will do so.

Dear Governor Bush, 

 

Thanks for connecting VisionQuest with Mary Laura Openshaw.  We have spoken and shared information.  I believe that she understands the difficulty children will have in learning to read, if they can’t see clearly – and therefore the importance of the VisionQuest program as it relates to Just Read Florida.  I hope to meet with her on the 14th as I will be testifying at the Senate hearings on that day.

 

Our challenge is making sure that this program is once again funded. (VisionQuest is currently under a 3 yr contract with DOH.)   If Senator Pruitt has his way, this program will be eliminated as we do not appear to be in the Governor’s Budget.  (He is threatening to pass the Governor’s Budget AS IS.)  If there is some way you could help us with this, it would not only significantly impact the goals of Just Read Florida, but the lives of 12,000 to 15,000 children annually.  

 

If you think it would be productive, I would like to meet with you on February 14th as well.  Please let me know your thoughts.  

 

Thanks for taking the time for this.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Good morning Jeb:
In my quiet time this morning a haunting thought I have had several
times
before, entered my mind once again. As earlier related, my intuition has
served me well over my lifetime and I felt compelled to take action and
share these thoughts with you. 

Terrorism seems to take on an aura of "organization for significant and
symbolic effects."
I am certain you all have thought through the possibilities, but I am
particularly concerned for the surrounding communities of military
installations, such as NAS Pensacola. I live only a couple of miles from
the entrance to the base in an apartment complex called AustinWood
Apartments whose occupants are majorly military personnel in training on
base at NAS. Also, just a mile north of where we live is a military
housing community (off base) called Mariner Village which is a known
military housing site. My local community in the Pensacola area is
teeming with the family members of military personnel as are all of the
other communities surrounding military installations throughhout our
country. The military's children make up a large percentage of our local
Hellen Caro Elementary and Jim Bailey Middle Schools students.  I can
believe such "targets" would be of particular interests of "significance
and symbolism" for terrorists attacks. Although the bases are armed and
protected, the surrounding communities, the homes of the families of
those who work on these bases are not. I am going to share these
thoughts
with Jim Paul, Escambia County school superintendent, and also with
management at the front of the apartment complex where my son and I
live.
I believe it is of utmost importance to consider these circumstances as
the news of new and continually increasing threats of terrorist attacks
is studied and acknowledged both on state and federal levels.

I am certain it is obvious to you and others, and you are well-versed
and
aware, that being the Presidents' brother,  you and your family must be
alert and take special precautions for your own safety in light of the
new reports using words such as "assasinations" which could be of a
symbolic nature. I pray for your personal and for your familiy's
protection.

God bless your day and your actions!

Subject: Florida Pre-Paid & Bright Futures



February 7, 2003

 

Dear Governor Bush,

 

I have become distressed reading the many articles in the local paper (i.e. Florida Today 1/03), as well as the Wall Street Journal (i.e. 12/16/02) in regard to the Florida Pre-paid College fund, and the Bright Futures scholarships. I know that most media are not friends of Republicans, but I have contacted my delegation, and haven't received anything to contradict the impression I've received from these, as well as other, articles. So now I'm turning to you to clarify the situation for me.

 

First, please know I understand two things:  The people of Florida have voted for several very expensive amendments due to their ignorance of the cost, and that you and most Republicans dislike raising taxes, which is one of the reasons I'm a Republican.

 

In today's Wall Street Journal editorial "Tax-and-Spend Role Reversal", it say's "...Jeb Bush of Florida, has held state spending down and can now propose $600 million in tax relief benefiting both investors and parents buying school supplies."  Jeb, personal responsibility has to extend to groups of people, and not just individuals. I, the individual, took personal responsibility for the education of my children; buy purchasing 10 years ago, a great expense at the time, the Florida Pre-Paid College fund for both of my children.  As a matter of fact, this was the way the court addressed college expenses at my divorce, and I'm sure I'm not alone here. 

 

My children will be entering college in 2004 & 2007. I have also required both of them to be responsible for performing and maintaining what is required to receive the Bright-Futures.  I have made this their personal contribution to their education, as the Pre-Paid wouldn't cover all the expenses.  They have both maintained close to a 4.0. At every report card we sit down, with the Bright Futures brochure, and compare their grades to the requirements. 

 

From where I'm sitting, Florida is about to reward the irresponsible at the expense of the responsible, a practice I'm getting very weary of. You are about to cancel or scale down the Pre-paid fund and Bright Futures.  I don't see how either can be even contemplated, especially for those that have already paid for the Pre-paid Fund, that would be an out-and-out outraged to me. That was bought and paid for, and for the State to renege on its commitment is utterly unacceptable.   I paid for the childcare costs for my children when they were 3 & 4, now the state is expected to pay for childcare for pre-schoolers, at my childrens personal expense.  No one can justify that, no one. 

 

How do you expect to get the message across to the masses that nothing is free? They demand smaller class sizes, free childcare, bullet trains, etc and they never see where the money comes from.  How could they, when my money is taken from me and given to them?  Am I going to be reimbursed for the years of childcare I had to pay for? So I, and people like me, get nothing at either end, and pay for both, for other people's children. If the Pre-paid is canceled, what then?  The state would then somehow, no doubt, find money to give to the children of parents that have chosen not to be responsible for saving, and/or making poor choices financially?   

 

The stock market didn't do as well for the State as they thought, so they're in financial trouble.  Guess what?  It didn't do any better for us, and yet we're not allow to say to the State "Sorry, I can't pay my taxes this year because I didn't get a pay raise and the stock market hasn't done well."  I have obligations and commitments too and I can't simply decide that I'm going to default on them and walk away - and either should the State.

 

You and the legislatures should sit down, decide what all this is going to cost and boldly and publicly with no apologies, state that the sales tax will increase by so many cents; to pay for the services the people of Florida voted for.  That is the only way the voting public is going to understand and get it through their thick heads that what they want, they have to pay for themselves - cause and effect: more services - more taxes, and let them be reminded of it every time they buy something.  I hear so many people say  "let the government pay for it", they have no clue that "they" are the government, "they" is where the government gets it's money for these "free" services - not from the trees in the backyard of the Governor's Mansion.

 

I realize during the elections you couldn't have said you would raise taxes if these amendments passed, because they would then have pressed you to say you wouldn't, and McBride would have lied and said he could do it without raising taxes.  But the election is over and it's back to the real world.  

 

Please do not make me personally pay, at the expense of my children's college or my husband and mine's retirement, for the stupidity of the voters on Election Day. My family and I have done all the right things to ensure for our futures; please don't pull the rug out from under us.

 

If it joyfully happens that all the information I've received from the media, as well as my local Representatives and Senators is false, and neither of these programs is going to be altered in anyway for people who have already paid for them, or already in middle school, I will be oh so happy to realize that I've wasted your time with this letter.

 

Thank you for your time and attention to this very important issue.

 

Sincerely,

 

Karen Zinsmeister-Dove

Dear Governor Bush,

With the possibility of Lt. Governor Frank Brogan stepping down, I wanted to
recommend Senator Jeff Atwater as a great candidate for his replacement.

As you know, Senator Atwater walked away with the election in November over Bob
Butterworth.  He was a one-term representative who basically ended a 28-year
political run.  I guess that goes to show what the public feels about him.

Commitment to excellence in business and community service are things he
understands very well.  He is a polished young professional who is aggressive
without being overbearing.  Additionally, his plan for making our public schools
safer has won him quite a bit of praise.  He also happens to be the grandson of
former Governor Broward.

Thank you for considering Senator Jeff Atwater as our next Lt. Governor should
the opportunity present itself.

Best regards,

Governor:  If FSET does not do their job up front, then these men, women and bootcampers coming out of jail or prison are not going to get the proper training or apprenticeship programs so that they can become truly self-sufficient.  

If they get proper assessment for training, then they have a better chance at getting real employment. What FSET is doing is NOTHING. FSET which stands for Food Stamps Employment and Training is supposed to assess the applicant for employment to become self-sufficient.  All they do is give the food stamps or not give the food stamps and send the inmates away.  

I have found that reciidivism declines dramatically when the inmates can get into training programs.  They need help in changing their lives around, not in being turned away and sent back out into the same community in which they began their criminal life. 

THIS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM ALL OVER THE STATE OF FLORIDA. THESE AGENCIES DON'T DO ANYTHING. ALL THEY DO IS DO PAPERWORK. AND THAT IS WHY THEY ARE FAILING and the taxpayers must continue to pay for inmates reciidivating. It cost $72 a day to keep the inmates in jail.  If these agencies complied with the law, then reciidivism would drop drastically like it has for our inmates. 

I will not tell you specifically what was said by a higher up in one of these agencies when she saw that I copied you on a letter. She basically laughed in a crowd of people that you would not care about this issue.  I guess she does not know you.

I am sending this to Belinda Keiser because she was  chair and is on the Workforce Board and understands these issues. Ms. Keiser is someone who should be at the state level Workforce Board because she is a person who understands the purpose of these programs and how they should be carried out.  Hopefully, these impact issue can be resolved if we put our heads together.

Commissioner

You have hit the correct points in response.  Our response has been and
continues to be proactive, but cannot encompass the entire coastline.  Even
the USCG and USNavy do not try to do this.  We must target the most likely
areas where we CAN make a difference like the public seaports and focus on
intelligence for the areas we cannot cover physically.  We do not however
get intel in support of this seacoast mission other than what we might
generate ourselves.  I recommend we continue to focus on our public seaports
and perhaps expand to those most critical/vulnerable private terminals such
as those housing inflammables, explosive compounds, and aerosol gases
poisonous to humans.  Keep in mind that while we can protect cruise vessels
relatively well here in the state, once they go to sea and move to the
Caribbean we can no longer influence the action.  The meeting today was a
good example of the USCG moving quickly to create standards for the private
terminals.  In the end we need certainty that the feds are focusing on intel
both where the ships go and on potential threats to them from our own
marinas.  We do not have that assurance from the feds today.  We also have
the limitations of all states . . . No Navy, no Coast Guard.  Even so, we
are neither without resources nor without remarkable success, unmatched in
the USA in protecting our public ports and the commerce therein.  The feds
are not focused as we are on the commerce.  We have done much and can do a
great deal more to improve what we can effect, such as the weaknesses at the
Port of Miami.  Recommend we continue to influence what we can do well and
be candid with our fed partners about the difficulties we face without
adequate intelligence support.  Will be available at your call this weekend
to discuss options and actions.

We will never be able to secure all the coastline of Florida nor the country
against this kind of smaller vessel.  We have said that repeatedly and so
has  Ridge and the administration.  All the more reason we focus on improved
use of information and intelligence for prevention purposes.
 
We have focused our effort here in Florida on our 12 deepwater seaports
which presents the most likely target for a terrorist attack (large numbers
of people on cruise ships  and in some cases a large volume of hazardous
materials stored on site and a large volume of cargo container shipments).
 
And, it helps to remind everyone that the protection of our water borders is
principally a federal responsibility, especially as it relates to  illegal
immigration.

POSTED: 8:00 a.m. EST February 7, 2003 
UPDATED: 2:54 p.m. EST February 7, 2003 

KEY WEST, Fla. -- Four Cuban coast guardsman defected to the U.S. Friday, 
docking their patrol boat at a Key West resort, walking into town and 
surrendering to a police officer. 

The four men, dressed in their military uniforms, approached Officer Matt 
Dorgan at about 4 a.m. and told him they wanted to surrender, Key West 
police spokeswoman Cynthia Edwards said. One man had a Chinese handgun 
holstered to his side, which he allowed Dorgan to take. 

Officers searching their boat docked at the Hyatt Marina Resort found two 
loaded AK-47 machine guns along with ammunition. The boat was still flying a

Cuban flag.

"They were happy to be here and were compliant with all of our requests," 
said Officer Tara Koenig, a Spanish-speaking officer Dorgan called for 
assistance. 

She said the men told her they had been on patrol about 1 a.m. when they 
decided to defect. 

"My impression is that it was a last-minute decision," Koenig said. "They 
were patrolling, talking about living at the poverty line when they said 
'You know what, the United States is only 90 miles that way.' So they set 
the heading on their boat, terminated communication with Cuba and headed 
straight here." 

Edwards said the men were taken to the Monroe County jail, where they will 
be turned over to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. 

The men's patrol boat was turned over to the U.S. Coast Guard. A Coast Guard

spokeswoman had no immediate comment and it could not be determined if the 
U.S. military had been tracking the men before they arrived at Key West. 

The incident took place on the same day the federal government increased the

terrorist threat alert level to orange -- the second highest threat level. 

Citing increased "chatter" regarding possible terrorist attacks on American 
targets this month, Attorney General John Ashcroft warned people to be on 
their guard. 

But some in South Florida are asking how a group of armed military personnel

were able to easily breach the sea border, getting past the Coast Guard and 
onto U.S. soil. 

Ridge recently visited Florida, delivering his first major address on the 
nation's security needs. 

Speaking at the Port of Miami, Ridge discussed the new Homeland Security 
Department, and some of the initiatives being taken by the federal 
government to secure the nation's borders and airports. 

Ridge's address came the same week reports said government investigators 
armed with fake identification documents and fictitious names were able 
recently to easily get past U.S. border guards who didn't even bother to 
check the false papers in some cases, according to the General Accounting 
Office.

This is how it works down here in the trenches, Folks.  While favorable
messages may be sent your way, in reality the whole thing is a bust,
generally speaking.

We need large, group homes, i.e., orphanages, there I've written the nasty
word, in which these kids can live without fear of being removed for some
minor infraction that is normal for any child, to which sevices can be sent
or installed so that half the child's time isn't spent driving from one
futile thing to another.  Oh, yes, I know the old argument for warm and
fuzzy but the system beats the kids up, not cuddles them.  A child may be
settled in, calling the foster parents Mom and Dad , feeling semi-secure and
the next minute be moved to another home because the child did something the
FPs didn't like.  It is so artificial!  Boom, there goes the sense of
security!  And, worse thing of all, it beats the child up so that the child
loses all faith in the system.

Please listen and work to correct an already failing system.  Continually
throwing money into a poorly run organization is not the way to solve the
problems that exist.  We need Newt Gingrich's nasty old ORPHANAGES back!

Thank you.

Our counsel at Smith, Ballard, & Logan stated..." The Department appears to have quite a bit of latitude with the contract". Details/specifics are forth coming. We are proceeding ahead... full steam.
 
We are presenting our proposal/rollout plan for web-enabling the FCAT , to Cornelia Orr and Shan Goff on Monday 2/17 in Tallahassee.They will review and give us their input , after which time we will present to John/Jim and  I assume yourself.
 
The proposal is shaping up nicely and we can get moving quickly... once given the green light. We have already web-enabled some previous FCAT items Cornelia shared with us.

Dear Governor Bush:
       It was an honor to meet you at the investiture of Charles Canady.  My children were thrilled to have their picture taken with you.  I am very appreciative of your efforts as governor.
       I am the quadriplegic who gave the invocation at Charles' investiture.  I am writing on behalf of my physical therapist, Joe Whitehurst, who is applying for the open position on the Board of Physical Therapy.  Joe is the immediate past vice president of the Florida Association of Physical Therapists.  He has served as a delegate to the national Association of Physical Therapists and has served on national boards.  
       Joe has taken care of me for the past four years.  I have found him to be compassionate and extremely gifted as a physical therapist.  After working for a national company for several years he started his own company eleven years ago.  He is deeply concerned about the issues facing his profession.  As someone who has a vested interest in physical therapy, I believe he would be an asset to the board.  
       Thank you again for your hard work and for your consideration of this matter.
                                                 Sincerely yours,
                                                  Vince Strawbridge, Jr.

P.S.  Thanks for sending Charles back to Polk County though we both suspect his future will transcend his present office.

Governor Bush,
 
I seek the opportunity of favorable consideration to be appointed to serve as a member of the Escambia County Civil Service Board.
 
For several years, I have worked projects of mutual interest with current board chair (Diane Rittenhouse), and members Thomas Gilliam Jr., and Sandra Phillips -- they know me well.  Moreover, Dorsey (Miller), Deon (Long), David (Langston), Terrell (Beard), Art (Rocker), Tracy (Richardson) and many others are aware of my tireless efforts for special causes during the past 8 years.  I am challenged by and committed to diversity and limited government coupled with exceptional passionate beliefs in family and personal responsibility.  In that spirit, I ask for the privilege of appointment to serve the citizens of Escambia County.
 
P.S.:  My wife Melanie and I enjoyed the fifth annual Black History Month reception on Monday evening.  We are profoundly thankful to both you and Mrs. Bush for the invitation to participate.  Equally important, we look forward to your keynote speech at the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) Black History Month Luncheon in Orlando on February 27, 2003.

Thanks for the heads up. And yes, I would appreciate your going to "bat" for
me.  It's not surprising my chairmen does not know of my interest since I
had not yet communicated it.  However, knowing my firm's commitment to
community service and economic development, I knew we would well receive the
Broward Mayor's interest.  The real issue is how we put aside tri-county
politics and assure that Broward participates.  Mayor Wasserman's desire -
as that of many of us - to see Broward participate in the FTAA proceedings
is one I strongly support. The future of South Florida is a 3-county
approach with Broward's role increasing because of its' unique geographical
location and dramatic growth.  This reality should not be ignored.  Since
the Mayor offered me up - along with Randy Avon and Pines Mayor Alex Fekete,
as citizens that could help now - I would think it vital for me to
participate.  In light of that, I think I would be a good rep. for GT, the
community and you in the process.  Yes, I would appreciate your going to
"bat" for me.  If there's a GT lawyer from Broward that should be involved,
it should be me.  Thanks.  Carlos

Honorable Jeb Bush
Governor
PL05-The Capitol
Tallahassee, Florida 32399-0001

Dear Governor Bush:

I am writing to urge you to approve a proposed Department of Children & Families budget amendment designed to prevent mid-year cuts of about 9 million in adult mental heath services related to certified forward denials.

These denials of payment for services rendered last May and June have forced the department to use current year appropriations to pay last years bills.  If the department in not authorized to move funds to cover this potential deficit, services started and / or expended with funds appropriated for the Legislator FY02-03 will be reduced or eliminated.  The impact of such cutbacks will essentially be doubled since the fiscal year is half over.

The six counties in the Sun coast Region will be hit the hardest if some other remedy is not found.  An estimated 4.4 million appropriated to continue the phase in of community-based services for adults with serious and persistent mental illnesses will be lost.  Theses are services for Floridians who were discharged from the G. Pierce Wood Hospital or who would otherwise be referred for admissions to a state hospital.

The Legislator made a strong commitment to the communities in the regions that there would be a major and continued investment in services for these people.  Without service expansion, we can expect increased admissions to crisis units, more people placed on waiting lists for state hospital beds and an increase in the number of people with mental illnesses on the street and in county jails.

Please intervene to continue this safety net of community-based services for theses vulnerable Floridians.  Thank you for your attention on this important issue.

I sent you an email about zero money allocated to records.  You sent 
back saying I was misinformed.  I think not.  Perhaps I didn't make 
myself clear, although I included the word "history".  The problem, of 
course, (and I'm sure you knew what I meant) is the  collection in the 
State Library  of records of
Florida's past.  Most important records.  
As Diane Roberts reported it took 150 years to build the collection and 
you are going to destroy it in a few weeks.  Shame on you.  And you try 
to claim the title of "Education Governor".   You say we can't afford 
the % million a year to maintain and house these records.  Do away with 
those awful FCAT tests.  They are nothing but facade.  Don't let you 
Speaker spend $600,000 on PR.  
Why don't you try to be a governor for the people. Do what's right, Jeb.

Jeb,

How's everything going? I understand that there will be a change to the head of the Florida Lottery. Someone that I am familiar with has been encouraged to apply. Her name is Maritza Gutierrez. She has managed her own ad agency in South Florida and through out the state for the last twenty years. She is an expert in marketing, administration and public relations. We at Clear Channel have been working with her on and off during the entire twenty year period. I guess what I am doing is recommending her for consideration. All right, I just thought I'd pass the information along.

Thanks see you later,

Just a quick update....apparently, after asking for the regulations on staffing to be put into effect, FHCA now want leniency because the large companies have tried to slide by without complying, again, blaming AHCA.  From the close-up view that I have, it would appear that the better compromise would be to keep the required staffing but put LTC in w/Drs. and hospitals re; lawsuits....I am opening a new facility, state of the art, in Wauchula and staffing is not an issue or considered a problem....the owner, Joe Brennick, realizes he must spend the $$ to maintain the compliance, thus make the profit....he is a private owner, for profit....the large companies are hoping you will fold to this staffing issue, but I truly see that stopping the bleed would offer them the revenue to staff appropriately, rather than say it is ok to break the rules "a tad"...my daughter has finished with Santa Fe Community College and it attempting to transfer to UF....she is on the Dean's list, never been in trouble, done community service for years....I am just amazed at how difficult it is to get into school.....a paperwork  nightmare and then there is no guarantee.....have a good weekend!!

This Story has been sent to you by : jachurra@starband.net


Ok Jeb. This may work. I recall that my initial message to you back in 2000 reporting on the wishes of a mother who said class size was her biggest worry. I wrote to you and recommended that Kinder through 3rd grade are the most affective. Even said for you to talk to Geore P., your son since he was a teacher at the time to see what he thought. I am a firm believer that kids are molded within this small time frame. All the efforts actually should be put here so that human kind will benefit most.



While you should probably wait a bit before lawmakers ask for the new vote, someone should consider how best to pay for a campaign explaining how kids are molded from K-3rd and how important these years are. 



Again I stress that Microsoft owes Floridians. There is a ways for Microsoft to pay its dues maybe by somehow introduncing some kind of grant to the schools for K-3rd grade. Eventualy Bill knows he ows someone he just doesn't know who helped him or maybe he does :-)



Anyway, let's go for it!

Subject:	Re-forming the Social Service

8 February 2003

Dear Secretary Regier:

I have just completed a brief review of the subject document. First and foremost, congratulations on moving the Department in the right direction.  Below are a number of constructive comments and thoughts.

Although you touched on the matter of contract administration, (i.e. Quality assurance), as the Department moves to CBC its function becomes oversight of contractor delivery of services.  The second level contract review methodology I experienced while in Broward County was an unmitigated disaster.  The Department needs more than QA, it needs “Contract Management and Examinations” to insure that intended services are properly and legally rendered.
*	It is not apparent from reading the document how that oversight will work for the Protective Investigative function envisioned to be migrated in the entirety to sheriff’s departments.

There is a statement that the functionality of Homesafenet has improved. Hopefully that is the case, but frankly it is doubtful. It is my understanding that HSN remains cumbersome, not user friendly, complicated and contains too many data elements. 
*	Briefly stated, it is an impediment not a tool.  
*	Workers under ideal conditions, and they are not ideal, must visit their charges every 30 days, prepare case plans, prepare for court hearings, respond to telephone calls and emergencies and so forth for as many as 40 clients. (It is notable and laudable that you are stopping the unconstrained influx at the front door and thereby reducing the caseworker to client ratio.) Spending hours inputting data into forms on HSN for someone else to use as a sledgehammer, is in a word, “nuts.” 
*	This is another area where major surgery is required.  

The Department’s “Child Welfare” function is beset by “sub-optimization” and it must be fixed. 
*	There is nothing in the document, aside form moving to CBC  that will solve that problem.  Moving functions to “providers” is not the solution. The solution is the “KISS” (Keep It Simple Stupid) principle. 
*	Candidly, I question the cost savings shown on the table, and would like to see the data.

The fact that you have taken the time to visit offices throughout the state, to listen is a breath of fresh air. That alone is a fine leadership and management action.  
*	As you undoubtedly know, for that to have any positive effect on the Department’s near non existent morale, there must be visible action within a meaningful window of time.

The prevention initiatives, family preservation, reduction of divorce, reduction of out of wedlock births and efforts to increase adoptions are marvelous, great goals but not specific enough in the “how to” department.  These will not be popular initiatives, because they adversely affect “rice bowls.” 
*	They are in the right direction for a welcomed change.

While the move to CBC will do much to attenuate the criticism that has been so intensely focused on the Department, it is “an invitation” to corruption absent tight oversight, and both the children and the taxpayers of the state will continue to suffer. 
*	Matthew 12:45 “and the last state of that man is worse than the first.”

Just a few observations to begin your day.  Many unanswered issues under CBC: runaway tracking, emergency shelters, mental health services, substance abuse, sexual abuse etc. Who will write the contracts, and what will they stipulate? Etc.

In any event, I pray that the Heavenly Father will sustain and give you the energy, determination and endurance to perform the gargantuan task that is on your agenda.

Respectfully yours,

Bob Pappas

Subject: Mobilization Remarks: A perspective of the Nat'l Guard


Governor,

Below are excerpts from comments made today as our soldiers left Ft
Lauderdale Armory for the mobilization site at Ft. Stewart:

I was not prepared for remarks, but I must admit,the emotion of seeing the
soldiers and families gathered as the trucks prepared for departure touched
a nerve:

"This is not your Grandfather's National Guard! Since Desert Storm the
National Guard has evolved from a force in reserve to a force in being.
Wherever the active duty Army or active duty Air Force is deployed, so are
the soldiers and airmen of the National Guard.

The National Guard is an Icon of our Nation's willingness to be ready at a
moments notice to defend freedom.

"The Icon of American " prowess and might" is not measured by the investment
of treasure in a platform like the B-2 bomber or Space Shuttle--these are
certainly an Icon of the American pioneering spirit, but the Icon of
American might and prowess is something felt in the heart as the
citizen-soldiers of the National Guard pull out of their Armories, puffs of
black smoke rising from the tall exhaust stacks of the diesel engines, and
the young soldiers smile of great pride showing through the American flag
taped to the outside mirror....mothers, wives, and friends crying and waving
small American flags as their sons and daughters go forth to defend our
great land and the freedoms we all enjoy....The citizen-soldier we call
Guardsmen-- there since before the birth of our nation.  There every time
our nation met crisis and there at every victory.

The Icon of American "might" is in the spirit of its people..."there" is
where the treasure of our Nation lies....that is why we will prevail in this
war on terrorism. Our Enemies misunderstand us. We do not count our
self-worth by the sum total of our material possessions. Our self-worth is a
measure of what we contribute to others and our willingness to defend
liberty.

There is nothing more powerful than the spirit of a free people--mixed in a
potpourri of cultures from "Sea to shining Sea".  We are truly "Proud to be
an American". 

"This land is our land". We will go forth and make whatever sacrifice
necessary to ensure the freedoms of this generation are here in the future
for the sons and daughters gathered today.. Remember President Bush's words
to our nation: Make no mistake about it, we will not falter--we will not
fail.

May God bless our soldiers in the Army and the Fla Nat'l Guard--these sons
and daughters of America-- go forth from here today to defend the freedoms
and core values of this great nation."

Best personal regards,

Doug

Please think long and hard and listen and hear about the programs you have put on your cutting board.

We have good programs in place, and rather than being cut, they should be expanded.  Our youth are our future, and with your proposed budget, you are cutting them off at the knees.

Dear Governor Jeb,
 
Your loyal friend Gladys Levy gave me your e-mail to ask you the following...
 
I am an artist living in Tampa Florida. I have created an image that represents the "Sum of Unity". It shows two entities united to defeat a common foe. The entire image is an abstract of Liberty. 
 
My inspiration for this image was a mixture of the anger after September 11, and the absolute masterful leadership abilities of President Bush. His ability to unite us, even against the tide of partisan rhetoric from the left, leaves me with an immense respect for our President. 
 
It is my wish to give President Bush a framed copy of this image. It's in a round wooden frame, about 11 inches in diameter, with glass. How do I get it to him? I have been told by several people that I should do this and I must agree with them. It is the least I can do for a man who has voiced the principles my family and I hold so dearly.
 
Once again, where do I start?
 
Kind Regards,

    Exemption to $5,000.00.  When my statement for 2003 arrived from
    the Tax Assessor, it was so indicated.  My family appreciates it
    very much.
 
    I understand that Rep. Ray Sansome will be offering a measure
    whereby the Homestead Exemption will be afforded to Vets, and
    upon death, the provision will be continued for the widow/widower
    until his/her death.  I asked him to include the provision being 
    afforded to the living children until they reach 18 yrs of age,
    providing they are pre-deceased by both parents.
 
    I ask you to support him in his efforts.
 
    I'm still perturbed by the "small classroom" requirement.  I fear 
    that the majority of Floridians listened to spin-meisters and did
    not get the facts regarding class size and its relevance.
 
        May you have much success in downsizing government and its 
    inherent costs.  The C A F R should be diligently reviewed
    to ensure we know where the money and deficits are.  No wonder
    General Milligan is bailing out.  However, I think he did well.
 
    All in all, there seems to have been immense activity in your 
    office and the statehouse in general this year.  All seems to
    be progressing very well.... IMHO 
 
 
    I noticed your lovely wife was cited for doing much good, and
    immediately asked to do more.  The old adage is "your reward for
    an excellent job is more jobs."  
    
 
    OBTW, thanks for the care and concern afforded Mr. Zummak (Wife's
    step-dad, and Pearl Harbor Survivor) while in Panama City!  
 
    Many thanks!

February 9,2003

Governor Bush;
Do you remember the children’s story”The Emperor Has No Clothes?”  In
this story an evil tailor convinced an Emperor that, for a hefty price,
he could sew celestial cloths that could only be seen by “worthy”
citizens of the realm.  Anyone who could not see these clothes was
unworthy of living in the kingdom.  Of course the tailor could do no
such thing but everyone was afraid to point this out to the Emperor
since he seemed so convinced.  So the evil tailor pretended to sew these
celestial clothes, the Emperor pretended to wear them, and everyone
pretended to see them.  No one wanted to admit they couldn’t see
anything because that would mean that they were unworthy.  Finally, a
small boy, seeing the Emperor walking naked in a parade pulled on his
Momma’s skirt and said rather too loudly, “But Momma!  The Emperor has
no clothes on!  He’s naked!”  That was all it took.  Everyone laughed at
the Emperor and admitted that none of them could see any clothes at all
and the evil tailor’s plan was finally thwarted.

Gov. Bush-you are in the same situation.  You are being fed “facts”
about the 8.5 Square Mile Area community that are just not true.  You
are being told things about 6D and the Modified Water Delivery Project
that are just not true.  Everyone is afraid to disagree with you   after
all you are the president’s brother, not to mention the governor of
Florida. Elected officials and agency staff are afraid that their
careers will be over or that they will be “punished” if they don’t go
along with you on this.  They are afraid to point out the obvious
because they don’t want to be thought of as “unworthy.”

6D is the slowest, most expensive option for completing the MWD
Project.  It has no added environmental benefits and is unnecessary for
restoring Shark River Slough.  We are not all “willing sellers.”  It is
not the only way to move forward to complete the project. There are 1027
pieces of property with 138 homes and 152 businesses that will be
unnecessarily condemned if 6D is implemented.  Common sense tells you
that any project that must condemn over 1000 pieces of property before
construction can begin will not be faster than a project where
construction can begin immediately.

The heartbreaking thing for this community is that they all voted for
you!  These Cuban refugees placed their trust in you.  They respected
you and worked to help get you elected.  Now you sell them out behind
their backs!  We shouldn’t have to have a legal defense team or
expensive lobbyists to protect us from our own government.  You are
willing to displace hundreds of helpless people, destroy their homes and
farms, displace hundreds of low income agricultural workers and destroy
people’s ability to earn their living   all on the incorrect assumptions
being fed to you by your advisors.  How will you look when the truth
comes out   when people all over the country know that you sold out the
people who trusted you on the incorrect advice of these advisors?

Please meet with me.  We can work together to resolve this issue without
years of delay or the condemnation of any more property.  I swear to
you, this project can be completed in 6 months if you will only give us
your support!

Dear Jeb,
 
Your speech was great at the ceremony.  Unfortunately, today's Herald helps to point out some of the horrors at MDCPS's construction that I have tried to get my colleagues to see since I was elected to the board.  As I hope you know, I have been a lone voice, often the subject of ridicule, for what was staring the board in the face for quite some time.  Anyway, keep up the good work.  Regards to your family.  Cordially, Marta

Subject: RE: Partisan Politics on the Board
Dear Jeb,
            I don't need to tell you how difficult politics is, and I respect all you are trying to do to increase the education level of the students of Florida.  Dade County has the highest stakes in the "dogs" in this fight, because our board represents the largest amount of children.  Unfortunately, the teacher's union has consolidated a majority on our board.  They are now voting as a block, largely to protest the Advisory Board.  This Democratic block is the same group that fiercely supported your opponent.  As our very qualified governor, I hope you will lend a hand to those of us who are in the minority.  If we are to serve our students to the best of our abilities, we need to convince the Democrats on the board to vote for what is best for our students, and not merely the support Mr. Tornillo's party line.
            I believe that it is also important to caution your Advisory Oversight Board of the political games that are being played on the MDCPS board.  This may help them direct their comments to the realities of Mr. Tornillo's control over many of the board members' fears.
            We can make this a winning situation for our students and constituents, but it is going to take thoughtful calculations.  As a reminder, School Board elections are NONPARTISAN in order to protect our students.
            As always, I support you and feel that you act out of conviction for what is best for the education of the state.  
Cordially, Marta

Mississippi, and several other states are collecting tons of money from

Or raise the price of vehicle regestration (the tags) by $1.00 per

Dear Governor Bush,
 
   Polk County schoolteacher, here.
 
   Does Florida still recognize March as Colon Cancer Awareness month?
 
  In September of 2000, my lovely wife (of then 2 years) was diagnosed with colon cancer. She,too, was a schoolteacher. We met while teaching at Lake Shipp Elementary in 1996.  She was a wonderful person that loved teaching and gave  125% to her kindergarten students. Unfortunately she lost her battle with the disease, 3 weeks ago tomorrow.
 
  I had to stop teaching 2 years ago, to help her with three different rounds of chemotherapy, radiation treatments and 5 hospitalizations. It was tough, but she never lost her great sense of humor and her love for her students and Jesus. We never blamed God, always hoped for a miracle, and consistently showed a loving Christian attitude toward others. I am really missing her, now!
 
   What can I do to help people understand the importance of being checked for colon cancer - (a colonostomy), to get early detection? I have recently volunteered to become a "phone buddy" to other caregivers whose spouses are going through their end stages of the disease.
 
   Thanks for reading my E-mail. Sorry, if I went on too long.
 
   I continue to believe that our great country is blessed to have the leadership of you and your brother , during a difficult time in history, when the people are looking for guidance and leadership!  I am proud you are our governor!
 
  Keep up the good work!  The best to your family!

Dear Governor Bush,

Last Wednesday I had the honor and pleasure of meeting with David Griffin to interview for the position of Secretary of the Department of Management Services. David indicated that you would be making a decision on who would fill this position in just a few days.

First let me say that I know that God has his hands on you and please take comfort in whatever decision you make will be God's will.

I would like to submit a synopsis of what David and I talked about during the interview.

Management Style and Dealing with Career Employees
I love the people that work for me and I manage by motivation, encouragement and empowerment. I am blessed in that I have a gift that compels employees to want to do their best for me. I teach them to be leaders, think positively and view the glass as half full as opposed to half empty. I show them enormous respect and let them know I am their biggest advocate. In turn I EARN their respect and get a motivated and willing effort in reaching our goals. At my last company Maxcess, we built a revolutionary communications network in just less than a year despite what many experts, including Lucent said couldn't be done in three years. You can't do that without happy, proud and motivated employees. I will bring a renewed energy to the department through positive reinforcement that my management style encourages. One of the first things I will do is humbly earn the respect of the career employees in the department. They are the ones that truly do all of the work. I will be their advocate. I will strive to give them all of the tools and resources they need to enable them to do the best job possible and be the best they can be. I will bring all of this to the DMS.

Leading a Large Organization
No one person manages thousands of people. You look for a person that can manage managers and teach them to lead. They in turn will teach the people below them to manage and lead. This is the recipe for success. I am that person. I have the leadership skills and years of experience needed to lead a large organization.

Handling Problems
I manage by the philosophy "you get what you inspect, not what you expect". Therefore problems are minimized or prevented before they happen. However, if a serious problem arises, I deal with them in a swift manner. To address and eliminate the problem I assemble my team members that are most knowledgeable about the problem. In some case I will assemble and consult with people from the outside to assist in addressing problems and issues. Problems in the private sector that are not dealt with swiftly can affect the survival of the company. Problems within a government agency have the potential to make certain people look bad. That is unacceptable. The problem must be prevented from growing to that magnitude. For example, what happened in the Department of Children and Families can't happen again on our watch.

Ability to Multitask
With over the 20 years of experience in leadership positions in the very competitive business world, I have had to acquire the ability to multitask to survive. Multitasking comes very easy to me at this point in my career. I have developed the ability to never lose sight of the overall vision and continue to drive it and still pay close attention to all of the day-to-day details that are required to be successful. 

I am a native Floridian, I was born and raised in Gainesville. I love my state. I really want to serve my State and the position of Secretary of DMS fits my skill set perfectly. Should you decide to choose me for that position, I won't let you down and will give all of the effort that I have towards fulfilling my duties. I am positive and very confident that I can do the job required. 

Thank you Governor Bush for considering me for this important position. I am honored. If you have any questions or need a copy of my resume, please don't hesitate to ask.

Sincerely,

          Good evening. I would like some assistance on helping 
          the 300 + small businesses in Belle Glade. We have tried
          to get assistance from the SBA office in Coral Gables and
          the best they can do is send someone once a month. I
          have been working with Denny Abbott of the Workforce Office
          in Belle Glade trying to help Belle Glade, Pahokee and South
          Bay. The 300 + businesses are from those three communities. 
          not all in Belle Glade. I did not want to mislead you.

          Please advise who I can contact or have someone contact me.
          The Congressman's Mom is back in the hospital and he just re-
          turned home tonight from DC. Take care and Dorsey told me he
          will be meeting with you soon.

          The problem is with getting the businesses certified. Regards to
          the family. God Bless.

Governor Bush.
     I am writing you because I do not know what to do!  My son is a 10 Th. grade student in Palm Beach County public school system.  He has a 2.5.  He has all 3 and 4's in conduct.  He is constantly being called down to the office by an administrator.  A simple infraction always turns into a major incident which is followed by an appointment made by me with the principle.  He has over ridden the other administrator more then once.  Yesterday my son was slammed into a wall three times by a student.  He did nothing to this kid he has a teacher as a witness.  This same administrator has now suspended my son for 10 days.  She called kids down and interrogated them about my son and his behavior in this class prior to this event.  However she never bothered to speak to this teacher directly.  She listened to one side of a situation that occurred in the class weeks ago and is using it to suspend my child. However if she had talked to the teacher she would have found out the teacher reprimanded this same child not my son.  However Some friends of this kid told a different story and the administrator I guess just believed them and does find a teacher a good source for the truth.  My son has a high An in Aeronautical space and this is his favorite class.  He also involved in SECME he has built the schools bridge, bottle rocket, poster. mousetrap car.  He is trying for a scholarship at FAU through SECME.  Dr. Schlossberg has talked to him and my husband about it for a few years now.  If my son is suspended for 10 days his grades will drop.  I do not think he will be able to take the engineering class at FAU this summer if his grades are below 2.0.  I am now waiting for the principle to call us.  My son is sitting here.  He is supposed to take Fcat writes next Tuesday.  My son is not labeled.  I am a stay home Mom of 3.  Member of the SAC board.  I need help.  My son has the right to an education and he is not getting it.  For the past few years we always seem to have issues that get passed along. No one will take responsibility at the school level.  He does not have a problem one in class or with his teachers.  That should mean something.  The last time I contacted your office I spoke to Phyllis Law.  I ended up homeschooling my son for the rest of that Middle School Year.  I do not want to think the answer is to home school again!  
Thank you,

Subject: A cry for help from a citizen


February 8, 2003

Note to Governor Jeb Bush

Dear Governor Bush:

While it is for me an honor to present to you my best compliments, I am crying for your help. Since I believe in what you said: "I am the Governor of all citizen in Florida" regarding their race, color of skin, religion and party membership, there is no doubt in my mind that the voice of a citizen in your jurisdiction that I am will be heard. 

In December 2001, I was with the Council Service of Rotary International in Evanston, Illinois, when my brother living in Palm bay called me up with the bad news of my ex-husband struggling with a sudden heart attack in Ocala Heart Center after being found by the Police on I-95, and my sister in coma due to a severe diabetic problem. I didn’t think twice to submit my resignation and come down to Palm Bay.  After their rehabilitation – thanks to God and Florida medical assistance - I had no other choice than looking for a job in the area considering that medical expenses swallowed all my savings. It is over a year now that I am using without success all Florida newspapers, jobs link, including the Internet in my search for a job.  

I am a US citizen born and raised in Haiti and I just turned 60. But I am strong and in good health and I want to work. In my twenties, I lived and studied in France and Spain and besides my two native languages French and Haitian Creole, I am fluent in English and Spanish. For over 20 years, I held translator and administrative positions with well known international organizations and corporations to see myself today down the drain, with bebts up to my neck, desperate for a job.

I refuse to be a burden for the government and do not want any assistance from Social Security or Welfare Services before due age.  What I want is a job where my qualifications and skills can be fully used and at best and be compensated for services provided.  For instance, I could work in the Krome Center for Haitian refugees in Florida or in the Immigration & Naturalization Service where I can help with the processing of investigations on Haitian refugees and/or illegal aliens. I can also translate from and into all four languages stated above with accuracy, efficiency, and fast turnaround. That could help your office or any other domestic institutions in Florida to deal with the increasing problems caused by boat peoples in American shores leading perhaps to a well established and comprehensive correspondence and reports between such office(s) and the Haitian Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the Haitian Embassy in Washington, D.C. or even the Haitian Consulate in Miami. As an American citizen, my contribution in that field could help solve some problems.

I used to and I am still willing to work hard to provide any place you can help me set foot in and where you deem me fit, with my assistance, but to be able to do so, I need to secure a job. I have no problem to relocate to wherever the job can be in Florida.

I do believe that my cry for help to you, Mr. Governor, will not die in your office’s basket or drawers, but will rather be subject to one more good action you can add to your palmares for the benefit of a 60 years old citizen who needs and counts on your understanding and compassion. I am sure that I will not be disappointed since I have faith that you can do one more miracle. I sincerely apologize for breaking with your daily concerns.  However, I wish to inform you that I have already exhausted all possible sources, that is why I am  submitting my humble request to your attention for a favorable solution since you are actually my last hope. 

Please find below my Curriculum Vitae. I am looking forward to hearing from you via email or by writing to me at the address provided below.  Your prompt reaction to my request would be highly appreciated.  

Respectfully,

Suze Domingue

Dear Governor Bush,  

My son, Steven Russell, was one of the original
Governor AllStars.  He also was Lt. Governor of Boys
State a few years ago.  I work in the marketing
department at Gulf Power Co. in Pensacola.  As a
parent of 4 children - 2 in college and 2 in high
school, I am concerned about the future of the Bright
Futures Scholarship.  Please take the time to read the
following two attachments -  I am sending a copy to
some members of the House and Senate.  I feel with the
1st attachment (Bright Futures) the scholarship can be
saved the way it is with over all savings to the
state.  The 2nd concerns an amendment that is to be
discussed concerning lotto rollovers.  With my plan,
lotto jackpots do not decrease much, but last year the
school system would have received $404 million dollars
extra to ENHANCE the educational system.  A lot of
thought went into this.  Please take a few minutes to
review.  Please respond yourself and not with an aide.
 Steven will be in Tallahassee to speak to the
Appropriations Committee on Thursday.  Please tell Lt.
governor Brogan - Steven admires both of you.

Sincerely,
Terry Russell

Below is just one situation in which your administration is destroying Florida.

I just learned one of your appointed stooges to the SWFWMD, Coogler, effectively killed in mid-presentation potential aquifer protection desperately needed. the list goes on and on. I'm like a whole lot of people who originally supported you, and your brother at the federal level, but I'll tell you this. Both of your environmental gutting policies are going to blow up in your face come future elections. L. C. Alexander, Inverness

Subject: Task Force & Nestle/new plant N.Fl. cozy  

 Members and Friends 
 I feel I should explain to all of you the reason for Save Our Springs Inc. lack of participation in the annual Springs Task Force Event. {This group is paid with our tax $$ to protect public interest of our springs} 
 I emailed the DEP in Tallahassee for date , time , agenda etc. as I was planning to set up a table as I do at USF Earth Day and Hillsborough County Earth Day.This event  would be extra special as the children had permission to attend and help with the Save Our Springs table and they were so excited. I was shocked  and angered with the extraordinary cost and the anger turned to disbelief when I noticed the main sponsor was NESTLE! .
 To sponsor the Springs Task Force  event Save Our Springs Inc. must pay $3,500.00
 To set up a table at the Springs Task Force event  Save Our Springs Inc. must pay $250.00
 To attend  the Springs Task Force event one  will be charged $70.00 per day and includes a trip to Damone water bottling facility.
Save Our Springs Inc.is made mostly of seniors and children , the seniors have memories of their springs and do not approve of being locked out of their favorite picnic and swimming areas . The kids are determined to work hard to "keep their springs clean and open for swimming and beauty to make future memories , but most of all to have fun days . Both groups are  VIP here at SOS . So many good organizations charge a average of $25.00 to be a member and so many are left out because of lack of funds. Therefore Save Our Springs Inc. charges $5.00 to join and Children and seniors have a special price of one cent.{I sleep well knowing no good person is left out due to lack of funds}. I am proud to announce we are quite successful with our policy of "making our elected officials work for the public instead of private interest" , just as our tax dollars pay them to do. Or at least we thought we were . A few of the children were planning to attend the Springs Task Force big event, they were so excited . I found it quite hard to let them down when I had to explain the astronomical cost to participate in this annual event. They made me so proud I had tears when they said "It's ok MS. Wolfe we will just wait and go with you  to Earth Day at Lowery Park " but why are they charging so much money ?" and why are they taking a trip to the water bottlers?" The bottlers are the ones closing our springs and pumping our public water , why would they do this ? aren't they the ones that are supposed to be helping us to save our springs? I got chills as I recalled those words , the first time I met MR. John Parker of South West Florida Water Management District I spoke these words to him "but I thought you were the ones supposed to protect us". I told the children Nestle was the main sponsor of the Springs Task Force meeting , they became very angry, here are a few comments .... "they are fake!' .....      " I hate them!"... "tell Governor Bush ! he will fire them!.... "I never want to go there!"....they stink!"......."I'm telling everyone I know that Task Force is bad".... POOP! that's what they are! just POOP!" ... Task Farce! that's what they are!"...  Wow I couldn't have said it better myself.  Look for the Save Our Springs kids at Earth Day this year, most are elementary school kids , innocent and trusting, I am sure you will find their dedication and honesty refreshing. Now for the rest of the story ............
 
 
The Florida Springs Conference is presented and coordinated by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.  Nestle' Waters is one of several corporations and organizations that are sponsors of the conference.  Funding provided by sponsors is being used to pay for breaks, continental breakfasts, and the reception.  The preliminary agenda is attached.  You can register at www.cmc-associates.com.
Nestle is the only sponsor Listed , see attachment for complete agenda.  This is the way the game is played these days. The monied interests sponsor seemingly good hearted, come together events. They hand out freebies. They advertise that they have met with 1000 Friends, etc. Then how can you possibly say they don't care about the resource? 

Interestingly, everytime the governor organized a study group, task force or some such temporary body of "volunteers," there is overwhelming representation by the regulated (or potentially regulated parties).
 
 
Agenda items 
 
Florida Springs Visitors: An Analysis of Selected Socio-Demographic, Economic and Behavioral Characteristics
What on earth does this have to do with protecting springs? Although I am sure Nestle/Perrier & Damone would be very interested. 
 
Development Potential of the Ichetucknee Springshed, Columbia County, Florida
What kind of a protection of springs issue is this? 
 
Establishing Minimum Flows for Springs in the SWFWMD: what will it take, how soon can it be done, and to what degree will it protect discharge?
What? This group has been on state payroll since 1999 and this hasn't been done?
 
The Bottled Water Industry and Florida’s Springs: Legal Issues of Resource Protection
 I remind you Nestle is feeding them breakfast  , lunch & snacks!
 
Effects of Nitrate Contamination on Reproduction, Growth, and Development of Animals Associated with Florida’s Springs
Awesome! Seven legged frogs! Two headed newts!? what? now this is getting interesting!
 
Lyngbya Wollei Production as an Indicator of Groundwater Quality Changes in Florida Springs
Basic elementary science , pumping draws toxic waste drawdown. Beware Nestle is listening. 
 
 
Results of Sampling for Selected Wastewater Constituents in Groundwater in the Silver Springs Basin North-Central, Florida
Nestle/Perrier bottles this one , makes me wonder...........
 
The True Cost of Restoring Kissengen Spring, Polk County, Florida 
True cost to whom? Not my tax dollar , big phosphate dried it up big phosphate can "restore" it.
 
 
Development of a Spring Glossary and Classification System for Use in Florida
I have a list of the springs existing in the 1800's , including their uses . I have a  list of current  springs and their uses. I also have a list of the springs destroyed and dead including details of their fate. I spent not a dime to accomplish this mission , just a little time on research , after all it is public information and easy to obtain. I feel it is my job as President of Save Our Springs to obtain information such as this. I work for free just as everyone else does in Save Our Springs and I enjoy my work , I certainly hope this little project doesn't require funding of public $$$$$$.
 
 The Role of the Citizen – Grass Roots Effectiveness
 
 Save Our Springs couldn't attend the annual Springs Task Force meeting due to the inflated admission fee , $70.00 per day is prime entertainment budget money for most , and $250.00 would sure buy a lot of paper & postage for SOS. We would have some left to get the scanner fixed.
 Even if we had the money I could never encourage spending it so frivolously as attending a "welcome party for Nestle Waters ."
The SOS kids are a great inspiration! and a fresh delight. Come see them at Earth Day Hillsborough County Fl. 2003.
 
I have included the complete agenda at the end of this letter.
                          
  The dredging of Itchitucknee Springs 
I discovered it WAS Jim Stevenson {the leader of the "Springs Task Farce" }that approved the dredging of Itchitucknee Springs last week. 
No one knows how he got the power to say go ahead and dredge without DOS approval.
 According to the Park Manager, there were many artifacts visible in the piles of sand and dirt that was removed.  
They used a bucket not a suction dredge.  I feel sick...... I can only imagine this historical rape......
Ah yes, cultural resources management by DEP..... Call the police!  Where are  the Historical people!
A four winged dinosaur skeleton was discovered a couple weeks ago , what undiscovered creatures were destroyed?

LIVE OAK - The Suwannee County Visioning Committee set up by the county commission to make recommendations concerning the comprehensive land use plan tried to have a January meeting Monday night.  However, the committee had only a small portion of its members there and little constructive business was done. The problem seems to be lack of communication among the many  groups that are involved in the complex task of setting long-range goals and guidelines for the county.  The next meeting is on hold until confusion over which county comprehensive plan is currently active has been cleared up.  Then the Regional Planning Council representatives will be asked to come and act in the capacity of the contract planner so the Visioning Committee can continue with its assigned task.

MADISON - The Madison County Commission approved a special exception  for Nestle Waters of North America to construct a multi-million dollar bottled water processing plant. The corporation asked for the special exception as allowed in the county¹s comprehensive plan as a resource based business. During the 2 hour public hearing Tuesday night, both sides were able to present their positions. Nestles said the plant is designed to be environmentally friendly, will pay for the access road to the plant and pay for improvements needed on SR-6, the main road leading to the proposed facility. In addition, Nestle officials said they are willing to work out arrangements to replace wells of nearby residents who fear the withdrawal of large amounts of water will effect their wells. Those opposing Nestles¹ location at Blue Springs said it would lower property values, increase noise and traffic in their quiet neighborhood as well as have a negative impact on one of Madison¹s natural wonders.

NESTLES WATER PROJECT STILL HAS PROBLEMS
SUWANNEE COMMISSION MEETING TUESDAY
 
 
MADISON - When the Madison County Commission acted as a planning board by giving the Nestles water bottling company a special exception, a major stumbling block was removed. However, Nestles plans to build a $60 to $80 million processing plant and warehouse to bottle water from Blue Springs in the NE part of Madison County could be crushed by the Suwannee River Water Management's action to start the process to revoke a water withdrawal permit issued over 2 years ago. The water district has various concerns about the proposed plant and its operation that could remove up to 1.5 million gallons of Blue Spring's water each day and what effect that would have on the total over all water system of the area. Discussion between the district and Nestles experts deal with possible withdrawal restrictions during time of drought and the issue of water quality of the springs during time of drought and flooding. Another issue is transporting water from one water district to another as prohibited by law.
 
LIVE OAK - Next Tuesday's meeting of the Suwannee County Commission will have several items that will deal with planning and economic issues. The town of White Springs is asking for the board's support to extend services to the I-75 and CR-136 interchange. White Springs is applying for a state grant to construct a wastewater collection system. In other similar business, the board will consider sending Commissioner Jerry Poole the the Mid-American Truck Show in Louisville, Ky. in March. His mission will be to obtain information for possible truck terminals to locate here. The board will most likely approve adding Branford and the Suwannee County School Board to the city/county relations committee and they will set a date to hold a workshop with the county recreation director to discuss park and recreation issues.
 
Thanks again John , guys like you help SOS "make a difference". 
 
And now a message from People Magazine Writer Michael Cohen regarding my People magazine story Jan. 13th issue .
"It never ends! Now Thomas is writing the editor for a retraction. We wont budge. Our editor says sorry if you are upset and they can write in to our mailbag. But there is nothing factually wrong. Perrier and Thomas are VERY upset. "
 
I made Thomas famous , I included him in my hour documentary aired in Japan , my story in Mother Jones , my feature in La Gaceta, and People magazine + numerous others , he should be grateful after all I didn't hog the limelight I shared it with Nestle, Perrier , Zephyrhills Bottled Water & Robert Thomas , hey that's free advertising ! I was just being fair . 
 
This just came in can anyone help? 
 Terri, it's Silver Springs. A local lawyer who owns property across SR
40 from Silver Springs attraction received a permit to pump 100K
gallons/day from a well there. His original application mentioned 2/3 of
the water would be for bottling and the rest would operate a 660-seat
restaurant and microbrewery. The application was later amended to reflect
it was solely for bottled water. St Johns approved it. Then when it appeared
the guy might be a witness in the county's action to stop it, he was forced
to hire another lawyer. He hired Wayne Flowers of Jacksonville, who I
understand was St Johns's former general counsel. The Perrier thing at this
point is just a rumor that I'm trying to confirm. That's why I was curious
if you or anyone in your group had heard of him.
Anyone know the answers?
 
Here is another request 
 
Hey Terri.
 Don't know if you are reading Madison newspaper still, but we are 
still struggling down here with the water boys.  Nestle etc. had their 
"permit" revocation "begun" on blue Springs.  Doubt this will do anything 
really.  They will just reapply.  I went to meeting last week for  Lee 
Citizens and really made Meg Andronaco mad.  Asked the bad questions.  She 
said she didn't know of any "lawsuits".  I had a few quotes-(Sipriano etc.) 
but wonder if you have a comprehensive list?  If so, I'd love to have it.  I 
also asked about their "guarantee" that if anyone's well went dry that Nestle 
would pay for new one etc.,  I suggested the "proof" of Nestle being the 
cause might be impossible.  I think I opened some eyes, but Meg was still 
saying that wasn't so.  Said they had never had wells go dry, but if any did, 
they would of course pay to drill new one.  Have you got any info to counter 
this, definite cases-or what type "proof" would be enough?    Oh, I bought 
the People Mag with your story!!!  Bravo.  Hope to hear back from you soon.  
Oh, Nestle is bringing a bus of Madison (maybe me to) to see the Zephryhills 
plant.  they did one earlier, but didn't tell me!  Probably 27th January?  
but not firm on date.  Be a good time to hand out some brochures, maybe?  (if 
you do that type thing)  Well, Good luck with all.  Hope to hear back from 
you soon.  Jackie
 
 Here you go Jackie , right out of the Perrier/Nestle Public Relations spokespeople's mouths .
 
Lauren Cargill "If you own the land you own the water , you can take what you want regardless of your neighbor."
 Spoken when Perrier won the Texas lawsuit due to 100 year law of capture, it was with in Texas law to dry thy neighbors well .
 I have a video of the Texas hydrologist stating Perrier was guilty of  drying  Bart's well . Cargill was gloating with victory.
 The towns people raised 10,000 to dig Bart a new well . Perrier did not pay one cent.

Subject: Foster Children (urgent)


Dear Gov. Bush:

I really apologize for sending another e-mail; however, I am desperate. Time is running out on me and my two foster children. I was waiting to hear from Laura, but I haven't. I am getting really scared. I just do not feel right sending these two precious children back to a father that is a stranger to them. Also, the fact that he is still doing drugs.

I have found out more information concerning the father, that has me very upset. Apparently he had his own fourteen year old daughter smoking Marijuana with my foster children's older sister. The half-sister has a picture of them smoking together. This picture has been turned over to the local sheriff's department down here. Supposedly, the Hawaii police department is looking into it. From what I understand about Hawaiians, they do not like the inland people. So, I don't think anything will come from it. Just like the DCF in Hawaii did not give his daughter a drug test. 

Like I mentioned before, if I thought they were going to a good environment, I would not be fighting this. Yes, I am only the foster parent, but I am the person they call Mommy. I am the person that has child proofed my home, bought new bedrooms sets, clothes, and became a licensed foster parent that required me to take classes for 8 weeks. I feel that I have jumped through hoops for these children, while the natural father cannot even stop smoking marijuana. He doesn't even hold a full-time job. He collects welfare and gets assistance from food stamps. I understand that these things do not make him a bad person, but what type of father would not want to be able to provide for his children and give them a father to be proud of? This is all I want to give these wonderful children, a loving and safe home. 

We also found out that the DCF in Hawaii has closed the file. Which means that once these children go back to Hawaii, there will be no one to watch out for them. They will get lost in the cracks, like most foster children. I just cannot sit by and let this happen. I have come to love these children as if they were my own. So has my family and friends. They will never go without anything here. I NEED YOUR HELP. 

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Kim Dobson

Governor Bush:
Thank you for your continued support of diversifying the economy of Florida, this is a top priority for us in Pasco County. I look forward to working with you and your staff during the very difficult upcoming legislative session. 
 
It was a pleasure to briefly speak with you last Tuesday at the Enterprise Florida Reception about my 25 year old nephew that was recently involved in stopping a prisoner accused of killing a Tallahassee police officer from escaping from the Leon County jail. His name is Bryan J. Cornwell and he is a Corrections Officer with the Leon County Sheriff's  Dept. I've attached the news story. 
 
What the newspaper didn't say was that Bryan was in fact able to get into the cell and single handedly handcuffed the prisoner before any back-up arrived. A getaway car was waiting outside. We are all extremely proud of Bryan in that a corrections officer with only 5 years of experience had the presence of mind to know how to handle this difficult situation. Of course, we are all very thankful that he was not seriously injured or killed in the process. I understand that he has been nominated for an outstanding law enforcement award. I know it would mean the world to him if you could acknowledge his efforts by sending him a letter; it would be wonderful for him to know that his bravery was recognized by more than just his family. His address is:
 
Bryan J. Cornwell

I sincerely appreciate your assistance with matter. Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Dear Attorney Kerry:
Chapter 33-601 gives the reasons why inmate visitation can be denied for two years.  Most of the reasons are because the visitor (that's us) has made some violation, such as passing forearms, assisting escape, for repeated visiting rule infractions conduct, criminal activity...etc..  

What is their justification of denying our visitation rights?  Are they saying we are guilty of something?  Like what?  I want to know!  Perhaps calling them evil, and corrupt?  Otherwise, just what grounds are they using against us as far as denying visitation?    

They are going out of their way to punish him (and us) for our belief that they are malicious and wicked.  

We would have to drive at least eight hours to visit our son for two hours behind glass.  Now they say not for two years?  Are they crazy? This was a juvenile that had a car accident at 16, what permanent damage are they doing to him?  

They will probably just eliminate him by suicide like other inmates.  The way he is being medically neglected and treated, I hardly can guess what Daymond will be like after he has been held in this torture chamber for a few years!

And you know what?  The warden is just plum proud of himself for how he runs this hanoi hilton.  Is this sick or what?

After you forwarded my email on, I immediately received at least four phone calls regarding a variety of opportunities for becoming active in state technology efforts.  Tomorrow I will be listening to the Digital Divide Council meeting - think I'll enjoy being a part of that group.  I'm also planning to be in Tallahassee on the 20th of this month to take part in the next ITFlorida meeting with Kim Bahrami - looking forward to that, as well.
 
During the last board meeting for the Central Florida HIMSS Chapter I heard that you had been invited to attend the reception kicking off our Central/South Florida joint HIMSS meeting that begins June 26 and will be held at Saddlebrook Resort near Tampa.  Central Florida and South Florida HIMSS are the two Florida regional chapters of a national healthcare technology group dedicated to guiding the automation of healthcare delivery-  <http://www.himss.org/> www.himss.org.  Kim Bahrami will be speaking at that forum - discussing your technology visions and how the heathcare IT folks may be able to help, I believe.  I can only imagine how busy your schedule must be - if you are able to attend, I'll look forward to speaking with you again in person.    Our national HIMSS conference (with approximate attendance of 15,000) will be held in Orlando next year - we're very excited about that! - and I'm sure at some point your staff will be contacted to see if you may be able to make an appearance.

Some time has past since we last spoke, but I wanted to keep the lines of communication open with you. I recently received an RFP for the FLAUSA project. Nothing specific has transpired since we first began interacting with each other, but your efforts are greatly appreciated. 

I would like to continue reaching out to the State of Florida to maintain Zynergy's involvment in projects pertaining to emerging growth technologies. I would appreciate  you providing me with any insight jnto new and up and coming projects or companies.

You will be happy to note that this year has been a year of growth and opportunity for Zynergy. We have grown our business and are now able to invest in emerging growth companies. We are not your traditional incubator because we not only invest in revolutionary ideas and businesses we also create the plan and assure that it is executed. As you are well aware the current politcal climate is very pro business and I believe that Florida will have explosive growth over the next 5 years in the area of technology, biotech and renewable energy. These are the types of companies we are looking for. I'm sure you and Governor Bush agree that creating an environment that promotes business is the future of our State. Zynergy is at the forefront of this endeavor and we are already investigating other possiblities including a potential Venture Capital Fund that is focused on Florida based technology companies.......

We should try to get together in person sometime in the not too distant future so that I can expand on the future of Zynergy and the impact I believe it will have on Florida and its economy.

A "Heads Up" to a HUGE Florida Scandal

Thank you, Jeb Bush

I had an informative conversation about the corrupt judges in Palm Beach
and Pinellas County (Florida's most corrupt county).... i.e., Judge
Charles W. Cope, etc., Florida's Sixth Judicial Circuit.

I'm getting good help from Johnnie Byrd and his investigative staff, Ed
Howlette, Esq., (former NYPD Police Investigator), to expose this
judicial corruption.  Judge Cope was arrested twice now being drunk at
two Judicial Conventions and on sexual battery charges.... he claims....
she wanted it.

In Palm Beach County, the senior lady I told you about is in hiding now.
She is a horrible terror victim of judicial corruption and just had
another $410,000 taken from her by corrupt lawyers and judges.... in
Palm Beach.  I spoke with her yesterday.

She is the once wealthy granddaughter of Gen. Frank Maxwell Andrews.....
(of "Andrews" Air Force Base) and has been systematically robbed of her
family wealth by corrupt lawyers and judicial officials.... they even
sold her Florida farm and her polo ponies and two other family
properties.  I'm keeping her calmed down and feeling safe in that I told
her that you care...... and I'm keeping the press away from her.

I agreed to provide a written report and certain names and case files to
Raquel on these felonious judicial crimes throughout Florida....
especially Pinellas County.

In the meantime, we request that you "please" direct a confidential blue
ribbon investigative task force to clean up these corrupt judges so we
can show that you are "already on top of this problem" long "before" any
show will go on the air like DCF subject did.  The JQC is a complete
failure.  

I personally don't like Bill O"Reilly taking shots at "you" and it rubs
off on the President and your family and your loving mom and dad.  

Two FOX producers in NYC are working on this and it may be aired in a
couple of months.  ABC Investigates has had two investigative producers
visit with me also.  These national TV News stories should be on the
corrupt judges and "not" all about Florida's governor.  

ABC and FOX News is producing a confidential expose' national story on
Pinellas County's corruption including Judge Cope and the corrupt
Sheriff's office.  Bill O'Reilly's New York producers have spoken to us
to get more criminal info for this special FOX segment on The O'Reilly
Factor...... and one Nightline producer called.

Speaker Tom Feeney wrote an urgent letter and "tried" to get Judge Cope
impeached through a local coward Pinellas County lawyer....then
elections came up, time ran out and the JQC covered up Cope's sexual
crimes with a "mock trial".  The St. Pete Times' Sr. Editors and the
Tampa papers and the Tampa Bay Legal Review and national news are
outraged at this ongoing corruption from the Chief Judge on down!  
Judge Cope was arrested stumbling drunk leaving from outside her (the
victim) hotel very late at night trying to find his "taxpayer's paid"
hotel and then, once arrested in her parking lot, claimed the young girl
he sexually assaulted while he was drunk on a California beach during a
national judicial convention had actually sexually assaulted him and
that she tried to force sex on him when he was drunk.... and he had to
fight her off.

.... she is an attractive and single professional, 30 years his junior
and a Doctor from Maryland visiting California on a vacation with her
mother, also a Doctor, and is terrified of Florida's open criminal
judicial and JQC corruption.

Cope was recently found to have rented a motel room in Pinellas County
and gotten blacked out drunk again and this was termed just a "little
slip up" by the corrupt chief judge and not reported to the JQC as
required by law via a judicial conspiracy as each have the criminal
goods on the other......

An excellent man to head this Governor's judicial task force and
corruption expose' committee is the Honorable Judge Gregg Holder, (West
Point and trustworthy MacDill AFB Colonel and very intelligent JAG) who
was brave enough to stand up to corruption in Hillsborough County when
corrupt judges, including the chief judge, ganged up on him for breaking
the ranks of silence and telling the truth and fighting against the
useless Judicial Qualifications Commission's cover-ups.

Judge Holder respects his sworn oath to the bench and the constitution!
The judge, who broke into Judge Holder's chambers, finally resigned just
prior to his impeachment to save his state's retirement money and he
wasn't nearly as bad as drunk Judge Charles W. Cope.... and his two
criminal arrests and years of corruption on the bench.  Another corrupt
drunk judge and drinking pal of Judge Cope just shot himself dead a few
weeks ago in Pinellas County.  

Judge Charles Cope said he was going to "Jump off the Tampa Skyway
Bridge" and kill himself during one of his psychotic episodes..... (St.
Pete Times) ..... and after several drunken blackouts he's being
investigated by the liberal judges of the Supreme Court of Florida on
even newer charges of case fixing with other Pinellas County judges
after being released from a state licensed habitual drunk institution on
a "taxpayer's paid leave" for over a year off the bench!!  

All of Florida's voters, both Republican and Democrat, are outraged!!
You need to quickly prepare and sign an Executive Order for an complete
investigation without delay.

Be "very very" careful and confidential as "local" members of the FDLE
here may have been compromised via money and the good old boy network
through another renowned drunk, Pinellas County's Sheriff Rice.  A bank
examiner met with me and wants to testify about corrupt Judge Cope and
was also threatened by the Pinellas County Sheriff's Department and
Judge Cope's brother.

Even papers and TV in California and national radio shows carried
stories about Judge Charles Cope's corruption.  Pinellas County's
corruption is far worse than Cook County, Illinois and this national
story is about to break wide open under "your watch".... this is about
child abuse, homosexual favors, money, drugs and sex crimes, etc., and
we can't let this blindside you and your political and professional
career.  

This is all we, in Florida, need after the good national press from the
Super Bowl!!

We have "solid proof" of these allegations that we need to get to you
and Johnnie Byrd and Judge Holder to stop this official terrorism in our
own Pinellas County.
I've spoken with Judge Holder and one of his West Point classmates and a
fellow Judge also knows of the judicial sewer of corruption in Pinellas
County.

Jeb, as a 60 year old vet, I know you are tough and courageous enough to
appoint a man like the honest Judge Holder or someone like him reporting
to you and clean up Florida's renowned judicial corruption.  Judge
Holder is a respected military judge and is somehow already part of the
state's judicial reform selection committee according to Raquel.  

You would be a shoe-in for a run for the White House in 2008 if you had
this Florida "victory" under your political belt..... this is your
bedrock!

We love and pray for you....

All the best.... John

Dear Ms. Ambassador,

     I am  of course recommended to you by your values and magnificent accomplishments and I must say I am one of your greatest fans, having had the pleasure of meeting you in person after your address, too briefly on your lecture tour some years, ago, if I'm not mistaken, in  the Dallas, Texas, area. 

     In all humility and modesty I am respectfully asking  you, as a  Top World Expert in your fields of interest, including without limitation, Foreign Policy and Political Theory, Discrimination, and Humanitarian Rights, to help me in such mannyer as you may choose, from time to time, in connection with the below referenced Think Tank activities and implementation of the Biowar Interactive Early Warning and Defense System with a follow-on of the Confidential  Computer Patient Record System. I know you are extremely busy but it is well known is only the busy people such as yourself who know how to get things done when there is no time.  The commercial parallel to the Think Tank,  Biowar Interactive and Confidential Computer Patient Record is the $250 Billion Dollar US domestic Doctors' Paper-less Office Market. It is of course due to your unique combination of intelligence, values, and expertise in the Policy, Government, and other areas, together with your position as a lady 

who advocates non-discrimination not only against Women but all persons that your help is essential. In this connection the Women Medical Risk Management section of the Business Plan at the Angelfire site, above, may be of particular interest, as well as my keen interest in debunking the myth of Biological Determinism, which in the minds of top experts, wrongly labels women to a disadvantage when the proper measure shows a 5% advantage in key areas. It is for this and other reasons that I mention John McCarthy, Jr., Esquire, and Dr. Nancy Miller (both referenced below) to whom, in all humility and modesty, I am most grateful for putting my best foot forward when they say, respectively:

"...Rothschild possesses outstanding characteristics as both an attorney and an independent business planner...successful in structuring profitable businesses.. I recommend without (reservation)..., John F. McCarthy, Jr., Esquire, 

"...Rothschild has the requisite systems engineering, managerial and integrative skills and, with proper and sufficient financing and approvals, should be able to successfully complete the provision of an integrated approach that would bring together the capabilities 
of information technology, organizational management, marketing and capital investment to develop or provide a system that could be used to (1) provide proof-of-concept(s) for any or all of the Communications Clearinghouse components: the Confidential computer-based Patient Record (including the Biowar Early Warning System module), the Media Communications Company, and/or the Monetary Communications Company, (2) demonstrate their utility and cost effectiveness, and (3) implement them, making them available,
globally." Dr. Nancy Miller May 5, 2002.

     We have a good mix that will be made to fit your criteria.

     John's firm is the largest in the world practicing exclusively in the US with presumably the largest clients in the world. I am very grateful for john's confidence and his consultation. Nancy has experience and understanding as a former US AIR FORCE PROJECT ACQUISITION MANAGER and her recommendation is, also, so very valuable and appreciated, as marketing may be to both John's and Nancy's clients and former clients.

     The System would provide the earliest real-time alert with proper instrumentation to Biowar in its many varients. The method of implementation is in part in its tradesecreted title within this e-mail and in part within its implementation process. 

      For ease of communication, I am copying John McCarthy.

     As to the most advantaged base for implementation of the comprehensive integrated system, I am asking the State of Florida's assistance and incentives in doing all it can in aiding me in the development 
of what could in all humility and modesty be considered key comprehensive infrastructure for the President's proposed TERRORIST THREAT INTEGRATION 
CENTER in Florida. Other key venues would perhaps included without limitation DC (Georgetown Medical if you agree), New York, Jerusalem and other locales in the US, ISRAEL and as appropriate. They would consist of sustainable activities parallel to the $250 Billion Dollar US Doctors' Paper-less Office Market which are integral,  functional, informational and economic 
business activities producing jobs and trade and economic development in the areas of Medical, Media, and Monetary Risk Management.

     The Biowar Interactive Internet Early Warning and Defense System, in my humble opinion is a leading and important first aspect in establishing the president's proposed Terrorist Threat Integration Center in Florida, Israel and other appropriate locales.

     In this connection, I am urgently and respectfully re-proposing a Consulting Agreement with the most appropriate clients (the US and State governments, included, at the earliest possible date concerning (1) The Biowar Interned Interactive Early Warning System as described herein and, including without limitation (2) Think Tank services. In this connection, my company has been awarded as set out on the following web site: http://www.sba8a.com/yr04/fl102197.htm, an SBA 8(a) participation,  and a US Government and Commercial Entity Number of 053J5.

     Of course there are many sole source methods available for the Contract in addition to the SBA 8(a) which are all sufficient in and of themselves, but it is a plausible addition. The proposed Consulting Agreement, from a not-for-profit, non partisan and non-political division of the Company set out here is for Think Tank services for the US and where appropriate, ISRAEL, and others agreeable to them are in the "third wave of think tank" traditions as set out by Richard Haass, Director of Policy and Planning of the U.S. Department of State, in his recent article entitled "THINK TANKS AND U.S. FOREIGN POLICY: A POLICY-MAKERS PERSPECTIVE with an eye to the Forth Wave if desireable and with the capabilities of the Company set out in the Company web site at:http;//'stephenalrothschild.tripod.com. The Company's advocacy, controversy resolution, economic, advisory, research and development capabilities along with its other capabilities in information systems development, social a

nd environmental infrastructure development, advanced research and technology development acquisition and as listed on the respective web sites are all present there as well as in the references and referals at http://angelfire.com/super/aim. The Company's issue 
focus is set out in the references web sites in both the domestic and foreign policy areas.

     The Company's primay proposal for Consulting Agreement from its for-profit area is for the following services regarding The Biowar Interactive Early Warning and Security Defense System (the "System") which was submitted in 1997 during the prior Administration was to be appropriately and properly implemented and to make America ready with a
secure homeland defense, then, and it has not been implemented or presented to the President, yet, but rather misappropriated and set-on an improper track. It may be too late to perform its appropriate 
and proper implementation before the next Biowar attack, if we do not act, now. As the proposed System protected individual privacy, as well, its delay has caused the Bush administration and the American 
public terribly severe and unnecessary headaches, worry and disunity at a time when America and America's president deserve responses and solutions building for unity and security. In all humility and 
modesty it is time to stand up to the job of putting in the right defense for America and her allies. The Biowar Interactive Warning System as proposed is believed far faster (over 200% plus) and more pervasive than the new Bioterror Monitor technique announced, last week. Knowing, of course, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, there can be no guarantees, the Biowar Early Warning System as proposed, before and now, appropriately and properly implemented, would, in all humility and modesty (1) provide the President, America, and the International Community the Terrorist Threat Integration Center with the necessary, but missing and critically vital earliest real-time instrumentation revealing subtle suspicious vital life sign deviations among vast populations (2) while protecting and enhancing the privacy rights of the people, (3) and enabling the greatest in-time response for the most effective deterrence and mitigation protecting Americans and America's allies. But, the B

iowar Early Warning and Defense System is still delayed since March 31st, 1997, by the prior administration, while America is facing its greatest terrorists risks. It was on or about that date I submitted a Proposal for the System to DARPA and others in the prior Administration by which I provided The Biowar Interactive Early Warning System White Paper forecasting the likelihood of sneak anthrax and other sneak biowar attacks against Americans and America's allies' and their populations. The Biowar Early Warning System was proposed for implementation in 1997 as the only suitable instrument to begin protecting Americans and America's allies against the unwarranted risks perceived to exist at that time and shown to have been, unfortunately, all too correct. The re-proposal, delayed by disruptive circumstances (1) respectfully and urgently requests an Initial Consulting Agreement for an even improved Biowar Interactive Early Warning System, recommended by Dr. Nancy Miller, set out

 below, together with John. This part of the balance of this letter describes the current situation, in which almost five (5) years after submission, finally, by letter Dated January 4, 2002, Dr. Anna Johnson-Winegar, Ph.D., with whom I first had contact at Chemical/Biological Defense in 1999, thanks me for..."...(your)...support of the DoDChemical and biological Defense Program and for the welfare of U.S. Military forces.." as I had been continuing attempts during the prior administration to gain implementation of the Biowar Early Warning System before American 
lives and resources which would be saved, were tragically lost. 

     Dr. Anna Johnson-Winegar's response  was most revealingly and perhaps with all due respect to her, courageous, as regarding one of the several continued submission's during the Clinton administration 
and well before the September 11, 2001 attacks. She disclosed that the Department had been only involved in a process for "..identifying outbreaks of non-battle related illnesses for the deployed soldiers...(and)...also working closely with civilian public hea
lth services as they develop methodologies.." but nothing more and nothing had been mentioned to have been conceived or implemented for the comprehensive 
Biowar Early Warning and Defense System implementation proposed by me as an integrative contractor to provide the American population and those of America's allies with the comprehensive deterrence and mitigation protection offered by the System which was offered 
during the prior Administration in 1997. Now, once the tragedy of September 11, 2001, and the time related anthrax deaths occurred, Dr. Anna Johnson-Winegar is quoted as saying "shame on us" for not acting earlier. Indeed. 

     So they have announced they will do something, now, after receiving repeated proposals to provide the System and after September 11, 2001, occurred, by using the trade secreted ideas/concepts without 
consent of the proponent and by spending $300,000,000 on it, but, they are admitting they do not have a model, only the ideas I tradesecreted and submitted.
Moreover, they admittedly do not know how to implement it and, as a consequence they are running late, on the wrong path, and causing the Bush administration and America great unnecessary problems and greater risks.
>Let American's admit we can no longer be tied to the prior administration's continuing inaction and methods of denial resulting in no defense or a sham defense from which the Bush Administration will have to 
dig out. If given a real chance, I will go forward as the owner of the intellectual property and the author of and one who presented it trade secreted, with a good tradesecreted model to provide the Bush administration and the American people and America's allies better humanitarian and ethical safeguards, better public acceptance, better public appreciation and better implementation than evidenced by the languishing years of the prior administration's fiddling. Please allow me to help in response to President Bush's assessment that .."..The United States has a critical need for cutting-edge technology that can quickly and effectively detect, analyze, facilitate interdiction of, defend against, defeat, and mitigate the consequences of WMD (weapons of 
mass destruction)..." The Biowar Interactive Early Warning and Defense System, properly implemented will help you do that better than otherwise possible giving you more time to breath, as did the Integrated Approach for the New York Times I presented resulted in a milestone for the world's greatest newspaper in the management of electronic news records.
 
     My e-mail address is the most reliable contact as I am, here, in Jerusalem, some distance from Washington, DC. Please advise to Rothschildbanc@lycos.com, telephone number 
country code 972-(0)51 953 222 or Stephen A. L. Rothschild 23 New York Street, P.O. Box 31471, Jerusalem, ISRAEL, 91004.

     Thank you very much for your time. Please do not hesitate to speak with John McCarthy whose telephone number is 214 880 8102 and anyone else you think of.

     Wishing you all the best, I look forward to speaking with you at your earliest opportunity.


Very respectfully,



Steve

The Executive Committee of the Florida Economic Development Council will be in town for our annual Legislative Conference Monday March 24, 2003 (approximately 5 members).  Appreciating the content of your schedule, we have been unsuccessful to date setting up a meeting with you to quickly discuss our legislative priorities as related to economic development in Florida.  We have already had an excellent meeting with Pam Dana (a necessary step to securing a meeting with you, per OTTED)...If we call Betty Hampton to secure, sending all the necessary documents required, would you be able to speak with our Executive Committee for 30 minutes or less Monday, March 24, sometime prior to 2pm?
 
Looking forward to your comments!

Re: Governor Bush's emphasis on diversifying Florida's economy 

Dear Economic Development Colleague, 

In his address to the Enterprise Florida board several weeks ago, Governor Bush emphasized that the diversification of Florida’s economy would occupy a higher profile during his second term.  To that end, he asked me, with incoming Secretary of State and Community Partnerships, Glenda Hood, to co-chair a statewide strategic plan along with Enterprise Florida President and CEO Darrell Kelley.  

I share the Governor’s belief that workforce development and economic development are inextricably linked and I believe that we are all working toward a common goal.  To that end, I want your voices to be heard and your concerns articulated in a strategic plan to diversify Florida’s economy.  I would encourage each of you to contact me to share your ideas.  I need and value your input. 

Please contact me by email at  <mailto:Susan.Pareigis@awi.state.fl.us> Susan.Pareigis@awi.state.fl.us or by telephone at (850) 245-7298. 

Sincerely, 
Susan Pareigis, Director 
Agency for Workforce Innovation 


(Below is the Governor's press release) 

GOVERNOR BUSH STRESSES DIVERSIFICATION THAT WILL STRENGTHEN FLORIDA'S ECONOMY 


Thursday, January 30, 2003 




TALLAHASSEE - Meeting with the Enterprise Florida Board of Directors, Governor Jeb Bush today laid out a cornerstone of his plan to diversify Florida's economy - a priority of the Governor’s during his second term in office. The Governor, who is Chairman of the Enterprise Florida Board, called on the group to join him in taking a focused, ownership role in guaranteeing a team approach to further the state’s economic development efforts. 




“During these tough economic times, Florida has been fortunate that we’ve been able to create new jobs and we’ve remained fiscally sound,” said Governor Bush. “We can and must do better to guarantee a brighter outlook for Florida. One of my top priorities is the diversification of our job market. Accomplishing this goal will require a team effort. I have raised the level of my commitment. I will call five chief executive officers of corporations every week to encourage them to invest or expand in Florida, or just merely to thank them for their presence here.” 




During the transition from the first to second Bush Administration, the Economic Development Transition Team made several recommendations to the Governor including continued reliance on the Enterprise Florida public-private partnership. The Governor has also decided to retain all economic development programs under his Office of Tourism, Trade, and Economic Development. In addition, Governor Bush has accepted a recommendation by Enterprise Florida and the Transition Team to step up the statewide strategic planning process to place a higher profile on economic diversification. Because of the importance of workforce development and growth management to economic development, the Governor has designated Secretary Susan Pareigis of the Agency for Workforce Innovation and incoming Secretary of State and Community Partnerships, Glenda Hood, to co-chair the statewide strategic plan along with Enterprise Florida President and CEO Darrell Kelley.




The Governor will also focus on growing the unique strength industries including international trade, space and defense, and building upon emerging technologies. He laid out four priorities that have the potential to create greater economic diversity for Florida: 




Securing Miami as the Permanent Secretariat for the Free Trade Area of the Americas, which will create an era of prosperity to the region and our state. The Governor recently appointed former Ambassador Charles Cobb to head-up the state effort.




Protecting Florida's military bases from the next round of base closures scheduled for 2005. Governor Bush will soon announce a leadership team assigned to protect our military bases and defense industry.




Continued commitment to creating the Centers of Excellence proposed last year by Governor Bush. The Florida Board of Education will give final approval for the $30 million program next month. The Centers of Excellence will create research cores and build commercial clusters around them.




“We have a remarkable business climate in Florida. In December, our state created nearly 62,000 new jobs compared to a year ago. We can do better. And we will, working together as a team,” Governor Bush noted.

Dear Mr. Rothschild,

Sorry but we can't help you at this point. Your letter is much to general
and we don't understand what you are asking. If you want the U.S. Embassy
to relate to your request you must be able to deliver it in a short and
concise letter.

Good luck.

Dear Ms. Torres, you write my response to your request is too long and general. Can you understand this?

(Ms. Torres you wrote) "...I am still not sure what is the activity you refer to in your business plan. Can you tell me in a couple of sentences? I understand you are looking for a business contact in Israel. Who would be a good match for your business plan?..."


QUESTION NUMBER ONE. "...what is the activity you refer to in your business plan. Can you tell me in a couple of sentences? "

..ANSWER TO QUESTION NUMBER ONE.
 
....SENTENCE 1: Yes.

Consult and advise individuals, companies, entities and governments and to raise and invest funds into for-profit* and not-for-profit ventures that benefit world humanitarian and ethical issues involving health, the economy, jobs and the sanctity of the workplace, all subject to and in conformity with applicable law and good ethics....(* for-profit being often SBA 8(a), veterans, women, minority small  and medium size businesses,) in fields including without limitation, Communications, and legal and financial services,and of course, as customary there are no guarantees.


....SENTENCE NUMBER TWO 2..subject to sufficient approvals and funding...the provision of an integrated approach that would bring together the capabilities of information technology, organizational management, marketing and capital investment to develop or provide a system that could be used to (1) provide proof-of-concepts(s) for any or all of the Communications Clearinghouse components: the Confidential computer-based Patient Record (including the Biowar Early Warning System module), the Media Communications Company, and/or the Monetary Communications Company, (2) demonstrate their utility and cost effectiveness, and (3) implement them, making them available, globally. 


QUESTION NUMBER TWO. 

"Who would be a good match for your business plan?..."
(HERE IN ISRAEL)

ANSWER TO QUESTION NUMBER TWO.
             
AT THE GOVERNMENT LEVEL - THE STATE OF ISRAEL..THE PM
...(IMPLEMENTATION POSSIBLY)......ALOUF PIKUD HAORIF

      
AT THE PRIVATE LEVEL:

........THIS ANSWER IS IN PROCESS AND WILL BE FORTH COMING.


Ms. Torres can you understand this? If not, please ask the Ambassador to help me understand what you do not see? The response is as you requested, in answer to 2 questions you required with the 1st requiring an answer in 2 sentences. There are approximately 81 words in the 1st sentence. The US Income Tax Code has 277 words in 1 sentence, so the amount of words can not be a problem as the US Government requires every US Citizen to be able to understand a sentence with 277 words in it. The 2nd sentence has approximately 83 words. This sentence parallels the sentence in a reference letter from Dr. Henry Krakauer the US Government Specialist for Epediemology in the Secretary's Office of the Department of Health and Human Services of the United States of America.

The above is to your question number 1. Your question number 2 is answered in approximately 10 words. 

This is your format.

What is it you do not see and is it possible the Ambassador will understand it?



Very respectfully,



Stephen A. L. Rothschild

E-mail  Delivery

February 3, 2003


US Department of Commerce associated with the United States Embassy in
Israel
Ms. Yael Torres
ytorres@mail.doc.gov
Tel in Israel: 03-519-7611

Dear Ms. Torres:

This is an alternate e-mail from the rothschildbanc@lycos.com, referenced,
below, which is filling up on capacity.

It was very nice meeting you by telephone, today. It is as the result of speaking with the US Ambassador's assistant who referred me to Ms. Hammond who referred me to the Commerce Deparment which resulted in our speaking by telephone. This is the e-mail we discussed.

As mentioned, I am urgently and respectfully re-proposing and requesting by this writing a Consulting Agreement with the United States as a Client at
the earliest possible date concerning (1) A Biowar Interned Inteactive Early Warning System as described herein and, including without limitation (2) Think Tank services. In this connection, my company has been awarded as set out on the followig web site: http://www.sba8a.com/yr04/fl102197.htm, an SBA 8(a) participation,  and a US Government and Commercial Entity Number of 053J5.

Of course there are many sole source methods available for the Contract in addition to the SBA 8(a) which are all sufficient in and of themselves, but it is a plausible addition. The proposed Consulting Agreement, from a not-for-profit, non partison and non-political division of the Company set out here is for Think Tank services for the US and where appropriate, ISRAEL, and others agreeable to them are in the "third wave of think tank" traditions as set out by Richard Haass, Director of Policy and Planning of the U.S. Department of State, in his recent article entitled "THINK TANKS
AND U.S. FOREIGN POLICY: A POLICY-MAKERS PERSPECTIVE with the capabilities of the Company set out in the Company web site at: http;//'stephenalrothschild.tripod.com. The Company's advocasy, controversy resolution, economic, advisory, research and development capabilities along with its other capabilities in information systems development, social and environmental infrastructure development, advanced research and technology development acquisition and as listed on the respective web sites are all present there as well as in the references
and referals at http://angelfire.com/super/aim. The Company's issue focus is set out in the references web sites in both the domestic and foreign policy areas.

The Company's primay proposal for Consulting Agreement from its for-profit area hereby re-proposed is for the following services regarding The Biowar Interactive Early Warning and Security Defense System (the "System") which was submitted in 1997 during the prior Administration was to be appropriately and properly implemented and to make America ready with a
>secure homeland defense, then, and it has not been implemented or presented to the President, yet, but rather misappropriated and set-on an improper
track. It may be too late to perform its appropriate and proper implementation before the next Biowar attack, if we do not act, now. As the proposed System protected individual privacy, as well, its delay has caused the Bush administration and the American public terribly severe and unnecessary headaches, worry and disunity at a time when America and America's president deserve responses and solutions building for unity and security. In all humility and modesty it is time to stand up to the job of putting in the right defense for America and her allies. The Biowar
Interactive Warning System as proposed is believed far
faster (over 200% plus) and more pervasive than the new Bioterror Monitor technique announced, last week. Knowing, of course, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, there can be no guarantees, the Biowar Early
>Warning System as proposed, before and now, here, appropriately and properly implemented, would, in all humility and modesty (1) provide you and the President, the Commerce Department, the Terrorist Threat Integration Center and the President's Counterproliferation Technology Coordination Committee, and American and her Allies, with the necessary, but missing and critically vital earliest real-time instrumentation revealing subtle suspicious vital life sign deviations among vast populations (2) while protecting and enhancing the privacy rights of the people, (3) and enabling the greatest in-time response for the most effective deterrence and mitigation protecting Americans and America's
allies. But, the Biowar Early Warning and Defense System is still delayed since March 31st, 1997, by the prior administration, while America is facing its
greatest terrorists risks. It was on or about that date I submitted a Proposal for the System to DARPA and others in the prior Administration by which I provided The Biowar Interactive Early Warning System White Paper forecasting the likelihood of sneak anthrax and other sneak biowar attacks against Americans and America's allies' and their populations. The Biowar Early Warning System was proposed for implementation in 1997 as the only suitable instrument to begin protecting Americans and America's allies
>against the unwarranted risks perceived to exist at that time and shown to have been, unfortunately, all too correct. This is a re-proposal, delayed by disruptive circumstances (1) respectfully and urgently requesting an Initial Consulting Agreement for an even improved Biowar Interactive Early Warning System, recommended by Dr. Nancy Miller, (former) United States Air Force Acquisition and Program Manager, set out below, together with John F. McCarthy, Jr, attorney, a key partner in America's and the world's largest labor law firm practicing exclusively in America, (2) including a One Page Summary, attached. The part of the balance of this letter describes the
current situation, in which almost five (5) years after submission, finally, by letter Dated January 4, 2002, Dr. Anna Johnson-Winegar, Ph.D., with whom I first had contact at Chemical/Biological Defense in 1999, thanks me for..."...(your)...support of the DoDChemical and biological Defense Program and for the welfare of U. S. Military forces.." as I had been continuing attempts during the prior administration to gain implementation of the Biowar Early Warning System
>before American lives and resources which would be saved, were tragically lost. Dr. Anna Johnson-Winegar's response  was most revealingly and perhaps
with all due respect to her, courageous, as regarding one of the several continued submission's during the Clinton administration and well before the September 11, 2001 attacks. She disclosed that the Department had been only involved in a process for "..identifying outbreaks of non-battle related illnesses for the deployed soldiers...(and)...also working closely
with civilian public health services as they develop methodologies.." but nothing more and nothing had
>been mentioned to have been conceived or implemented for the comprehensive Biowar Early Warning and Defense System implementation proposed by me as an integrative contractor to provide the American population and those of America's allies with the comprehensive deterrence and mitigation protection offered by the System which was offered during the prior Administration in 1997. Now, once the tragedy of September 11, 2001, and the time related anthrax deaths occurred, Dr. Anna Johnson-Winegar is
quoted as saying "shame on us" for not acting earlier. Indeed. 

So they have announced they will do something, now, after receiving repeated proposals to provide the System and after September 11, 2001, occurred, by using the trade secreted ideas/concepts without consent of the proponent and by spending $300,000,000 on it, but, they are admitting they do not have a model, only the ideas I tradesecreted and submitted.
Moreover, they admittedly do not know how to implement it and, as a consequence they are running late, on the wrong path, and causing the Bush administration and America great unnecessary problems and greater risks.
>Let American's admit we can no longer be tied to the prior administration's continuing inaction and methods of denial resulting in no defense or a sham defense from which the Bush Administration will have to
dig out. If given a real chance, I will go forward as the owner of the intellectual property and the author of and one who presented it trade secreted, with a good tradesecreted model to provide the Bush
administration and the American people and America's allies better humanitarian and ethical safeguards, better public acceptance, better public appreciation and better implementation than evidenced by the
languishing years of the prior administration's fiddling. Please allow me to help in response to President Bush's assessment that .."..The United
States has a critical need for cutting-edge technology that can quickly and effectively detect, analyze, facilitate interdiction of, defend against, defeat, and mitigate the consequences of WMD (weapons of mass
destruction)..." The Biowar Interactive Early Warning and Defense System, properly implemented will help you do that better than otherwise possible giving you more time to breath, as did the Integrated Approach for the New York Times I presented resulted in a milestone for the world's greatest newspaper in the management of electronic news records. My e-mail address is the most reliable contact as I am some distance from Washington,

Subject:	Sun Sentinnel 8.5 Square Mile Article
Attachments:	P-8.5-SS-030209.pdf

Joette ... see the attached article that Neil Santaniello authored for the Sun Sentinel this weekend ... front page center!  Finally a headline and story with a human side that does not totally vilify the marvelous people of the 8.5 SMA ... in my judgment, probably the most objective to date.  
 
I must say that I strongly disagree with Governor Bush's dismissal of this as a minority/human
rights issue ... he would not even entertain a discussion of the minority/human rights aspect of his support for condemnation at our recent meeting.  Most illuminating for me in the entire article was the quote by Lorraine Valladeres: "She said her husband, Jose, who fled from Cuba after losing his farm to the government, thinks what's happening smacks of politics like those he fled under Castro. 'There is no way you can convince him that this is not communism,' Lorraine Valladeres said, 'To him it's no different.'" What a shame that many of these Cuban-American residents face needless removal from their property for a second time in their lives ... and this time in the "greatest democracy on earth."  
 
And certainly Jose is only one of many who have expressed the same sentiment to us.  Without money and friends and power, you have no say ... you are only an object of political expedience ... at the other end of the spectrum, nobody is clamoring to remove Weston which is in the middle of the Everglades and unequivocally blocks flow ... certainly we would never advocate Weston's removal, but the residents have too much money and influence to even have governments or enviros suggest removal.   Don't know about you, but I find this to be a very scary situation.
 
Courageous, enlightened leadership could have easily made the 8.5 SMA a win-win situation ... this waste of taxpayers money ($57.5 million) to unnecessarily condemn homes and families does not portend good things for the future of Everglades restoration where balance is a must if we are to succeed.

Subject:	2003-2004 BUDGET RECOMMENDATIONS

I have examined your '03-'04 budget recommendations and wish to comment:

Beach renourishment shows a $14.6 cut and  the elimination of its dedicated
source.

PLEASE REALIZE HOW DETRIMENTAL THIS IS TO COUNTIES, (LIKE INDIAN RIVER
COUNTY) WHO HAVE BEEN HOPING AND PLANNING THEIR BEACH RENOURISHMENT PROJECTS
FOR YEARS!

I am a conservative Republican and long time supporter and hope upon hope
that you will change your thinking on this.  I have endeavored to educate
myself on beach renourishment through the various seminars offered, etc.,
and, in fact, am scheduled to attend The 16th Annual National Conference on
Beach Preservation Technology, February 12 - 14th.
(I've attended two others).

I have also read The Heinz Center's "Evaluation of Erosion Hazards," (April
2000) prepared for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and whose
collaborators were the top scientists in the field.

Because of the economic impact of Florida's beaches, which is enormous, we
cannot ignore the economic engine provided by healthy, viable beaches.
Surely the  impact of the renourishment project on Miami's beaches has
proven that beyond any doubt.

With a dedicated funding source, which we all thought we had, Florida's
beaches can be restored and maintained.  And, yes, I do think it's that
simple.

We are working very hard in the trenches, taking untold political risks to
win these programs.  Here in Indian River County it has been 30+ years to
finally get a project.  In fact, we hope to start our first phase in early
February.  But, if we can't count on the State's dollars, the effect will be
to put us way back.


Kindly reconsider your recommendation in this area.  Perhaps you could
reduce the Wastewater Treatment Facility Revolving Loan by $5 million, and
the Drinking Water Facility Revolving Loan by $5 million, and Economic Dev
Transportation Projects by $5 million to accommodate the full $30 million
funding for our beaches.

Sincerely,  Commissioner Caroline Ginn

Governor Bush,
I just wanted to thank you for visiting our school. Our Pre-K and Kindergarten students were very excited about your visit and I am sure they will remember it for a long time. Please thank your wife for reading to our students over the close circuit TV. I had have several students mention that they enjoyed the books. 
 
Our teachers felt honored that you visited our school. We have a very dedicated staff at Apopka Elementary, which I am sure you realized during your round table discussion. Our principal, Janet Medina-Maestre, is one of the main reasons our school is improving. Every decision she makes is in the best interest of the children. I hope you will find the time to visit our school again in the future.
 
On another note, I would like to thank you for your involvement in Cystic Fibrosis. I have a 22 month old daughter with CF. Last year we had a golf tournament to raise money for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Chris DiMarco, PGA Pro, and Mallory Code, one of the top junior golfers in the nation who also has CF, participated in the tournament. We raised over $33,000. It was during this tournament that I found out you sponsor a CF golf tournament. I understand that your tournament will be in Orlando this year in December. I wish you the best of luck in your tournament. I would like to invite you to The 65 Roses Golf Tournament in Honor of Aubrey Rose Brown at Heathrow Country Club on November 10th. Chris DiMarco will once again be participating in the tournament. I know you are extremely busy, but I just wanted to give you an invitation.
 
Thank you again for visiting our school and your efforts towards finding a cure for Cystic Fibrosis.

Hi Jeb,

I spoke to Tara's office on several occasions and dropped some
information
at your office on the 23rd of January regarding the trip our families
are
making to Tallahassee for the budget committee meetings.

Many will be bringing children with autism.  I wanted to make sure that
you
were aware.  I am very disappointed, your staff said you are unable to
spend
a few minutes with us.

We will be there to inform the legislators of the rapidly increasing
population, (520% in last 5 years) and  the growing need for educational
and
health services funding.  There are many who are not receiving services
of
any kind, many have been cut by Maximus, and many are being served but
cannot get crucial behavioral and personal care assistance services. It
seems they have been determined not 'medically necessary'.

I know that you have been a great advocate for us, but the problems
continue
to compound and DS has been less than competent.

I am hoping you will agree with our request that Autism be relocated to
the
Department of Health.  This would be very beneficial for many reasons.

Many parents believe vaccines have played a role in their childs
affliction.
   Unfortunately, the DOH does not even mention autism on their website.
We
went from 1,290 in 1998 to 8,010 persons in 2003.  I feel it is time to
educate them, ask for assistance and stop trying to make this population
fit
into programs that are not truly tailored to their needs.  Most other
states
have specific and separate programs for autism both in HHS and
education.
We are like square pegs trying to fit into a round hole.

Our issues are very different in so many respects than other persons
with
disabilities.  I serve on the redesign and quite often disagree with
those
who have less behaviorally involved children and want them included in
every
aspect.  Some children just can't be and it should be about choice.  I
hope
you will support us.

I heard it was you birthday on Tuesday, Happy Birthday.

Susan

Kim, we have funded the monies needed for amendment 9. It is very ugly but we have proposed  a $900 million increase which is a 6.5% increase. No other state comes close. the problem is that 80% of the money needs to go to the class size reduction amendment. this leaves little for teacher pay increases. Our proposal to implement the amendment creates real pressure to spend money in the class room and to cut overhead. I think it will work but I would much prefer to increase teacher pay than arbitrarily reduce class sizes. I campaigned against the amendment with great risk for my own campaign but it was the right thing to do. Kim, thank you for writing! I miss seeing you.

        Good Morning, Busy Bee!  I hope all is well with you!  I'm going to ask forgiveness for this e-mail; I was asked by my principal to seek out any words of comfort regarding budgeting for lowering class sizes. Ugh - right?  So,  I apologize.  :)

        Our principal is desperately trying (as are all the county's principals) to figure out how she will fund the required 4 teachers our school will need to lower class sizes by 2 children.  She has been told she will receive funding for 1 teacher, but the rest must come from school cuts.  She's also been told all salary increases will be cancelled to fund this amendment.  Personally, I think there is some fat to be trimmed in some schools (such as ours), but not in all.  Admittedly, I'm sorry to hear about salaries, but the acknowledgement that teachers are underpaid is nothing new.  :)

        Anyway, sometimes there are so many "middle men" inbetween the top and the trenches, that communication to those of us at the bottom is nearly nil.  We are "reacting" rather than "acting efficiently" since we really are in the dark.  If you (or anyone on staff - if you are too swamped) have any words of wisdom and direction to enlighten us, I know it would be a tremendous help - not only to principals, but also to ALL. Even there are only cold, hard facts to hear, it would help to hear it from the top, rather than from the press and the multitudes of middle men.

        As I said, I apologize for this.  I don't like asking for favors on others' behalf, but I'm sure you understand first-hand, all too well, what a vortex that can be.  So.... any words you have to share, I will pass along to all, and try to pump up the morale in the trenches!  At least that way, I can return the favor somewhat.  :)  Thanks for your time; you're a treasure!  Bear Hugs ~ Kim  :)

P.S.  Remind me to tell you sometime about the transfer I have put in for.......    :)     Change and challenge is good for the soul!  :)

Mike,

 

I hope you had a wonderful weekend with your family in town for the christening! I figured it would be easier to update you by email so you could read it at your convenience.

 

I spoke to Larry Keough of the Catholic Conference on Friday. He had just met with Patricia Lavesque. She told him that the Governor gave her a very clear message regarding his priorities on the tax credit scholarship program. He is very much against an administrative cost allowance, and is “lukewarm” on eighth grade kids currently in private schools getting the scholarships. He is open to discuss perhaps a higher per scholarship amount at the high school level, but did not favor a higher level at the lower grades.

 

She expressed in very strong terms the Governor’s displeasure with the school choice constituents being unable to agree on one agenda. Mike, it pains me so much to think that the Governor might feel I would ever try to work for something he didn’t agree with. You know I have been trying so hard to unify this group, and that is the only reason I agreed to try to work for Larry’s issue, even though I didn’t like it. I told him long ago that in this session we must only help solve the state’s fiscal problems—we can’t be asking for things that don’t help them.

 

If we are unable to convince the Governor’s people that an increase in the individual scholarship average can help with Amendment 9, there is no way I would want to try to get that done in the legislature. We have plenty of time to convince them of the merits of this idea—especially with the TaxWatch report coming on this issue and the many great projects we have in inner city areas.

 

Interestingly, Larry said essentially the same thing. He said that if the Governor opposed the eighth grade language, he would not try to advance it. I told him that was very wise, especially with the enormous hurdles we face in the Senate just getting the cap lifted. Larry said he would be shocked if Heffernan pursued the administrative cost provision against the Governor’s wishes. I agreed that that would be inconceivable to me.

 

Mike, if you see the Governor on Tuesday, it is really important that he knows that his agenda is my agenda, and that I have been doing all I can to preserve the integrity of this program and align it with his principles. I will always work towards those goals.

 

I have a Partnership For School Readiness meeting in Orlando tomorrow from 10am to 1pm, but I am reachable any other time. Thanks for your continued help!

 

John

Subject: Modified Water Delivery Project and the 6 D option

February 9,2003

 Dear Governor Bush;
 
I am writing you concerning the Modified Water Delivery Project and the 8.5 Square Mile Area community that is going to be devastated by this action.  These peoples rights are being taken by the government for no other reason than to lock up more land.   Gov. Bush the "facts" you are being given about the 8.5 Square Mile Area community are just not true.  It is incumbent upon you to look into this further and meet with the  citizens of the area to get their side of the story.  
 
It is my understanding 6D is the slowest, most expensive option for completing the MWD Project.  It has no added environmental benefits and is unnecessary for restoring Shark River Slough.  The people of the community are not all "willing sellers" and it is not the only way to complete this project.  There has been a plan in place that would protect this community and move the project forward but it has only been partially implemented because they have excluding the portion of protection of the 8.5 Sq. mile area
 
There are 1027 pieces of property with 138 homes and 152 businesses that will be unnecessarily condemned if 6D is implemented.  Common sense tells you that any project that must condemn over 1000 pieces of property before construction can begin will not be faster than a project where construction can begin immediately.
 
If you would please meet with these people to find out if what they are saying is true.  You can reach Madeleine Fortin, President of The 8.5 Square Mile Area Legal Defense Foundation ph. 305-255-7098    <mailto:mfortin@bellsouth.net> mfortin@bellsouth.net.

I do not believe your advisors are telling you the whole story or you would not be taking the action you are taking.  Although I live in Arizona I have done enough research to know the action you are pursuing is a radical one.  The people in this area were strong supporters of yours and felt you believed in and would protect individual rights.  They thought they would get a fair hearing from your administration but are wondering how they could have been so wrong.  There are many of us across this nation wondering the same thing.
 
Please take a hard look at this land grab and please meet with the affected people before going forward with the 6D option.

INSTALLMENT 9

2003 Team Florida Economic Development Series

“Key Factors in Site Selection”

February 6, 2003

Dear Florida Legislator:

 

The traditional site selection process has evolved in terms of criteria being added to a long list of issues a business must consider when choosing a new location for an expansion or relocation. After the internal list of business criteria has been finalized, the external process begins to select the location, which best suits the business needs. 

 

Site selection is, in the final analysis, a process of elimination. Given the lengthy list of factors that must be considered and the degree of importance assigned to each one, there are plenty of opportunities to be removed from consideration. To further complicate the process, the availability and speed of data and information puts significant pressure on economic development groups to respond in a timely and efficient manner or be eliminated from further consideration.

 

Florida has developed a very credible network of development agencies from Enterprise Florida at the state level to the local organizations at the city and county levels. Thanks to legislative and gubernatorial leadership, the programs in place to assist expanding companies are competitive and have a proven track record of success. Our continued success depends on working together to make Florida as competitive as possible in the site selection process.  


                                                         


                                                          Top Ten Site Selection Factors

The following is from a newly released research paper by the Harvard Civil Rights Project, taking issue with One Florida and Talented 20. 
""...what happened in Florida differed in almost every important aspect from the official claims. Even more troubling was the fact that much of the press coverage had simply reiterated those claims without asking any of the obvious questions.'' 
There you have it, the Florida press gave the governer a free ride on Talented 20.

Subject: DCF Adoption Subsidy for Tutoring

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I am writing to extend my congtratulations on your second term and
request your assistance in my adoption of a special needs child in DCF
care.  You may recall that we met at your final campaign event in
Naples, and in 2000, you kindly forwarded some foreign policy memos to
your brother's campaign for me.
 
Here is the situation:  I am an approved DCF adoptive parent, and am
interested in possibly adopting a particular 13-year old child who has
been in care for many years.  We have spent lots of time together, and
it is a good match.  The boy has ADHD and various learning disabilities,
and is presently in a group home in Margate.  He is struggling in
school.  I have requested additional subsidy funds to provide for
after-school tutoring, which, as a single parent, I may not have time to
do myself.  DCF has authorized an additional $91 per month, which will
cover only about 4 hours of tutoring.  
 
Can you do anything to secure some additional funds to help this
deserving child -- and this adoptive parent?  It would probably be a
wise spending decision for the state and for the child.  I would like to
move forward on the adoption next month, if all goes well.
 
I am pleased to hear that you and DCF Secretary Regier are strengthening
the department.  Good luck in that important work!  I look forward to
hearing from you and/or DCF on this request.
 
With best regards,

Dear Senate President Jim King, dear Senator Carlton, dear Legislators,
 
it seems like SB 1202, which was enacted after the 2001 session and a long fight in Tallahassee , will not be given the time to bear the fruits as intended. Remember, this bill was enacted after many compromises and a huge rally in Tallahassee (see : http://www.ccfj.net/AARPRally31401.htm ) under the battlecry "Quality First"! The AARP and many consumer groups got together to help convincing the legislators that this bill was necessary to protect our Elders in need of Nursing Home Care. Remember, at that time the Nursing Home industry hailed SB 1202 as the best thing ever! It was as well established at that time that it would take some years to take effect. But, here we go again! Without waiting for the results of all the reforms intended by SB 1202, the industry is trying again to tip the scales in their favor.
So, please "Protect Florida's Nursing Home Residents" and "Say No to Caps". Please read the appeal of our friend Anna Spinella, a well-known Nursing Home Advocate. Help our Elders in need of our help, since they are unable to help themselves!
Thank you for listening to our concerns!
Best regards

"Protect Florida's Nursing Home Residents" 
"Say No to Caps" 


STATEMENT OF ANNA SPINELLA, INDEPENDENT ADVOCATE, TO THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON NURSING HOMES – FEBRUARY 10, 2003.

  
My name is Anna Spinella and I am probably the ultimate nursing home consumer in the State of Florida. 

I have been my family’s “designated caregiver” for more than 20 years, and from 1993 to 2001 was the primary caregiver for 3 family members at the same time, taking care of them in their home, in my home, in assisted living facilities, and in 9 different nursing homes in the bay area, only one of which provided adequate care.   


As a result of the things I saw, heard, felt, tasted and smelled during that time, I have become an indepenent advocate for nursing home residents. 


       So I speak to you ... 
on behalf of the approximately 70,000  citizens who live in Florida’s nursing homes,... 
at a time when the GAO has established that 9 out of 10 nursing homes do not provide adequate care, primarily due to lack of staff,  and  ask you not to re-open  the issues settled by  SB 1202, enacted in the 2001 legislative session.  


In 2001, based on  loud cries from the NH  industry  that there was a crisis in insurance coverage, and  after a long arduous battle between that industry, the trial lawyers, the insurance industry, the AARP, and others, a very delicate balance was established to provide  quality of care provisions to benefit nursing home residents, in exchange for a substantial limitation on the right of nursing home residents to accountability for poor care ... 
the very accountability threat which was all that kept the NH industry from further cutting of the 3 s’s – staff, services and supplies – after the loopholes which previously allowed the industry to make mega profits  were identified by the GAO and closed. 


NH residents did not receive everything they needed in 1202 in terms of quality of care  – there is still a long shopping list -- but what they did receive was generally determined to be a delicate balance to what they gave up in terms of accountability. 
  
Tort reform has already been enacted for nursing homes in Florida – it was  enacted in that bill.  


At that time 1202   was hailed by the NH industry as about the best thing since sliced bread, even though the insurance industry indicated it would be 2 or 3 years before the results of that legislation would bring down premiums.   


Subsequently the insurance  industry revised its estimate and pointed to a 3 to 5 year time frame.  Very recently it still points to a 3 to 5 year future time frame, and adds “if ever” or “maybe never”.  


Now, some 18 months later, before SB 1202 has even been fully implemented, and although $27 million dollars was given by the state to nursing homes toward their insurance premiums, and with the help of about $300 million new money basically to finance the staffing provisions of 1202,  
there are rumblings from here and there for further tort reform in this arena , perhaps through the back door of the medical malpractice tort reform that we hear about every day. 


I receive calls from  caregivers and staff people every day – somehow my name is out there as someone to call about nursing home issues – from these calls, and my personal visits to nursing homes and family councils,  I can tell you first hand that 2 things are now happening : 


Those nursing homes which  are trying hard are making some progress in quality of care.   
I hear that daily from residents and their families, and from staff, and they anticipate more improvement when the final staffing increment occurs at the beginning of next year.   


Other nursing homes, for whatever reason appear to be trying to circumvent the 1202 staffing provisions with a variety of methods, including reducing housekeeping and dietary staff and requiring cna’s to perform those tasks in addition to their normal hands on duties. 


In addition,  requests being made to allow nursing homes to meet the 1202 statutory staffing requirements only some of the time, or on an average, or by counting staff on hand in independent living sections of life care facilities and also counting those same staff in the nursing home section, or other methods  which ignore the fact that nursing home residents live 24 hours a day, seven days a week  365 days a year.  


Nursing homes  are also more and more frequently, and successfully, using the threat of criminal trespass, adult protective services, or guardianship provisions against family members who raise quality of care questions. 


The NH industry has been clearly identified by the Department  of Justice to be riddled with fraud.  
                               
Hardly a day passes when the newspapers do not carry a story of the comprised down amount of money fraudulently taken.   


I wonder if this could this be a Worldcom or Enron by another name. 


The NH industry is apparently still profitable,despite cries to the contrary, since whenever a group of homes is sold, there is always a buyer ready to pay a pretty penny.—could this be part of the pattern which enables the industry to raise is reimbursement rate with each change of ownership? 


The insurance industry truly is in crisis – make no mistake about that – but it is not a crisis that should be solved on the back  - or more clearly – on the backsides, of NH residents.   


It is an insurance crisis and requires an insurance solution.   


It is a crisis that was created by the insurance industry’s business practices, and not by NH residents. 


The current population of our nursing homes primarily consists of people who have paid their dues to society – not unlike your parents and grandparents, and mine. 


They survived  : 


The First World War,  
The Great Depression, 
WW 2 – the Big One, 
The Korean War, 
The Vietnam War, 
The Cold War. 


Many are veterans – many are purple heart veterans. 


NH residents  deserve better than they have been receiving these last numbers of years.  


Under SB 1202 they will be getting better care -- 


The larger numbers of staff will allow staff to do their jobs better, and the improved numbers should result in improvement in obtaining and retaining good staff. 


Please don’t reopen  SB1202 to solve an insurance problem. 


Thank you.

Dear Gov. Bush,

RE: above URL.

I am passing along this URL to you, so that you
might consider passing it along to people in charge
of distributing technology grant info to groups in FL.

As stated on their web site, this is a non-profit organization / foundation,
run by a group of lawyers in Texas with a lot of other people, including a
superintendent who worked
under Rod Paige.

They have won a large class action lawsuit, and now have $350 million in
unclaimed funds from said class action lawsuit. Their stated mission is to
bridge the digital divide.

They are seeking to give away the money to individuals, community groups and
educational organizations located in every state, including FL in 2004,  by
giving these people Toshiba computer equipment.

Their list of partners includes faith based organizations,
Boys and Girls Clubs, Title I schools, etc.

I happened to read about this foundation in their ad seeking
grant applications, published in today's NY Post.

Honorable Governor Bush;

This past election, I worked my fingers to the bone to ensure that you were
re-elected, along with Mr. Charles Bronson.  As a concerned citizen, I am
horrified by civil rights abuses by officers of the law when I read stories
like the one I have enclosed below. You are a good man, a just man, and I am
keenly interested in what you have to say on this sad matter.

What is wrong with the mindset of police in these incidents?  Since when did
a simple "no" spoken to a government authority become an intolerable affront
justifying immediate goon-squad tactics?

I await your response.  Thank you,

In canker war, common sense becomes a casualty
Sun-Sentinel.com
Michael Mayo
February 4, 2003

Tom Cowart and Denise Orr never liked their grapefruit tree that much. So
when the state said it was infected with citrus canker and the cutting crew
came to remove it in December 2000, they didn't protest.

"I was really nice to them," Cowart said. "I even gave them sodas."

But when a crew came to take their tangerine tree last February, things
weren't so cordial.

Cowart asked for a search warrant. The cutters said they didn't need one.

Cowart told them to get off his property. They said they didn't have to.

A tense standoff ensued on the front lawn of Cowart's Fort Lauderdale home,
with Florida Department of Agriculture officials and Broward Sheriff's
Office deputies being summoned. It ended with Cowart pepper-sprayed, pinned
to the ground by three officers and arrested.

"They put him in the back of the cruiser, made him sit there for something
like three hours," said Judy Budinger, a neighbor who witnessed the events
and whose husband, Gene, photographed them. "They didn't leave until the
crew had cut the tree down to its stump and put it through the grinder."

Cowart spent the night in jail, charged with resisting arrest without
violence and obstructing justice.

"Over a citrus tree," Cowart said. "My neighbors were like, `Tom, I can't
believe what they did to you.' It's like something out of a Stephen King
novel."

His nightmare isn't over. A judge dismissed the two misdemeanor charges in
November, but the state has filed a motion to reinstate them. A hearing is
scheduled for Feb. 13 before Judge Ginger Lerner-Wren.

The war on citrus canker drags on. Common sense has been a casualty.

That this case got to this point shows how emotional the fight has become.

Many South Florida homeowners say they don't trust the Department of
Agriculture and its ham-handed campaign to eradicate a disease whose threat
might be overstated. State officials say South Florida homeowners are naive
and don't realize how serious a threat the disease is to the citrus
industry.

Cowart declined previous offers to have the charges basically dropped,
because he sees this as a matter of principle. He feels as if the state
trampled on his rights, even if his tree was infected.

"The way they marched onto my property, you'd think they owned it," said
Cowart, 50, a fence contractor.

Jim Facciolo, Cowart's attorney, said, "I don't know that there's a citrus
canker exemption to the U.S. Constitution. Even if everything the state says
is factually correct and the tree was infected, there's no reason why the
Department of Agriculture couldn't get a search warrant."

Mark Fagan, a Department of Agriculture spokesman, said state law mandated
an infected tree's removal, even without a search warrant or the owner's
consent. "We'd be breaking the law if we didn't remove the tree," he said.

At the time, the state's policy of removing "exposed" trees within 1,900
feet of infected trees had been halted by a court order.

Fagan was called to the scene last Feb. 7 and witnessed the confrontation.
He said there have been only a handful of arrests in connection with the
eradication program, which began in early 2000, and Cowart's might have been
the first involving pepper spray.

"He became very argumentative," Fagan said. "It took three officers to bring
him down. He's a big guy."

"They had no right to do that to me," Cowart said. "I was on my property. It
was pretty Gestapo-like."

According to the arrest report filed by sheriff's Deputy Armando Enrique,
Cowart was "making threats at Department of Agriculture" employees. But
Cowart said he never threatened anyone.

"I didn't hear any threats," Budinger said. "All I heard him say was,
`Where's your warrant?' and `If you don't have a warrant, get off my
property.'"

In her November ruling dismissing the charges, Judge Lerner-Wren wrote: "The
Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution ... does not allow the
warrantless entry into property by the Department [of Agriculture]."

Cowart said he didn't fully understand the circumstances that put his
tangerine tree on the cutting block. He said he received a report on Jan. 3,
2002, indicating his tree had canker, but he never saw an inspector take a
leaf sample.

"I didn't consent to anything," Cowart said. "The tree looked the same as it
always did for the last 10 years. It was loaded with fruit."

Fagan said Cowart had received an "immediate final order" in January
notifying him that the tree had tested positive for canker and was subject
to removal after 10 days.

Cowart said he received the order on Jan. 14, but it said he had 30 days to
fight it. He said his girlfriend called the state's canker hotline a week
later to request a pathology report. He said the report didn't come before
the cutting crew did.

Fagan said the Jan. 3 report was the pathology report and that he "tried to
explain it to [Cowart] in layman's terms" on the day of his arrest.

Cowart said nothing was clearly explained that day.

"Fagan was running around like King Kong, saying, `We're going to cut your
tree down.' I'm a reasonable guy. I've complied with this before. If he just
said, `Here's the pathology report, your tree's infected and we have a
warrant to remove it,' I would have felt like I'd exhausted all my legal
options."

Said Budinger: "They could have easily had a conversation instead of a
confrontation and come back another day."

The battle goes on.

Subject: Well done


I wanted to pass on to you what a great job the Forrest service, game & fish, along with the Pasco Sheriff department did. 
On Sat the 3rd of Feb, my wife who is into hiking started on a hike through the Richloam Forrest. We did not know the map was wrong, and had planned a 8-10 mile hike, which should have taken her 4-5 hours, Seven hours later, she did not show up, so at 6:00 PM I contacted the Sumter County Sheriff department to say she was overdue. They in turn notified Pasco County sheriff dept. the game and fish and Forrest service.
Under the command of Lt. Goodhue, the three agencies set up a command post and spent the night searching for her, with dogs, choppers, off road vehicles. Unable to find her in the dark they started over, at dawn, bringing more of everything to search for her. 
In the mean time, my wife found her way out of the woods, 9 miles south of where she was scheduled to meet me. All to a bad map. 
This did not take any thing away from the searchers, during the night, they did their best to reassure me she would be find, were kind, yet professional. They did every thing they could think of to find my wife. 
In the Navy, when someone or a group did exceptional they were given a well done, to show they went above the normal routine to do their job. To me, these men, and women deserve that well done, so I thought I would write you, as their leader to let you know about them. 
If, in talking with the heads of these agencies if you would mention to them, the outstanding job they did. 
Thank You

Molley:
 
Thank you for responds to my email to the Governor Bush.  It seem that we are playing telephone tag, because we keep missing one another.  Since, we spoke last year, nothing has move.  I check all the nursing homes on the list , all wanted medical record that I could not provided.  The medical records must come from the nursing home he located ( Marshall Health Care Rehabilitation  in Perry Florida).
 
As, I stated to you in our phone conversation, I did not closed Bay St. George.  It your department responsibility to verfied with the family of patient were would they like to have the patient transfer.  The followong list are my choices.

1.	Westminster Shores
2.	Bon Secours Maria Manor  
3.	Colonial Care Center
4.	Manor Care Health Service 
5.	The Laurels

Any location that will accepts patients in his condition. A facility that may give him the proper medical and daily care treatment. Or hopefully, your department could make the proper recommendation , since your department is responsible in the proper certification of these facility throughout the state.
 
Maybe, I have not made myself clear in my emails, I just want to have my father closer to us and want him to share the period of his life with his family, that he has been able to appreciate for the last thirty-six years.  How difficult, can it be to transfer a patient to another facility after knowing that patient want to be near his family.
 
Mr. Alex Littlefield from ombudsmen in Tallahassee, has had conference calls with us and verfied, that he has spoken to my father and he want to be located near his family. 
 
Once again this process is over a year and everyone is dragging its feet and playing politics.   I will call you tomarrow and perhaps we can resolve this situation by tomarrow.  Hopefully, you will be in your office at 9am.

Subject: Venezuela 2003
Importance: High


Dear Jeb:
 
 I am attaching hereto the complete presentation on Venezuela.  A task force will be making this presentation in Washington, NY, Houston, Miami, Spain, France, Italy, Portugal,England, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and Chile, to start with. Not an easy task.It think  it is an excellent situation report and represents the facts as they are, facts which can be very easily confirmed. Because change is a constant today in Venezuela, I will keep sending updates. I would appreciate if you forward this document to high ranking  officials of the Administration as well as Congress that you deem convenient. 
 
Today, the Chavez regime has:
 
1. Control of the General Assembly. That allows him to do as he please. No questions asked. This would not represent a problem in countries that have democratic institutions and abide by democratic rules. That is not the case in Venezuela
2. Control of the Supreme Court
3. Control of the General Prosecutor(Fiscal)
4. Control of the Defense del Pueblo(Ombudsman)
5. Control of the Comptroller General
6. Control of the Armed Forces
7. Control of thee Comandos( Armed Circles)
8. Control of Petroleos de Venezuela, or what is left of it. He has fired aprox. 10.000 employees out of a total work force of 40.000. He has expressly said that these employees are traitors and will never work in PDVSA again. The present situation is very critical for various  reasons:a) we are exporting only about  1/3 of the 2.7 mbd we had in November . That means revenues have decreased in the same proportion b) we have not been meeting our commitments with our customers.. In the case of the USA we were, before the strike, supplying about 1.4 mbd ( 14% of US imports)  c) at present we  are not considered a reliable supplier and d) this situation has an impact in the strategy vs. Iraq
9. Systematically violated the Constitution of Venezuela, and its legal order, as well as some international treaties, and complete disregard for the Rule of Law
10. Is in criminal contempt, for refusing and ordering the armed forces not to obey the judgments of the Supreme Court when they are no favorable to his regime
12. Publicly stated his position against the present World Trade System
13. Complete control of all the foreign exchange and has announced that FX will not be available to the golpist, meaning, private enterprise. He will use this control as a political arm, and on the other hand to fund his revolution. Same he will do with the revenues of PDVSA. According to his plan, all revenues belong to the government, not to the state, and he is free to use them as he wishes.
14. Publicly said that his is an armed revolution. We have every reason to belief, and we know as a matter of fact that he is looking for a bloody confrontation
15. Taken  admistrative actions against all the private TV networks and we know that their license will be revoke sometime next week
16. Deprive the residents of Caracas of a police force capable of guaranteeing our personal security
17. Consistently and continuously taken actions against the freedom of expression, the freedom of information and the freedom to choose. There are a number of cautelar decisions in favor of journalist and members of the media, issued by the Inter American Court of Human Rights
18. Violated  the Inter American Democratic Charter, and will keep violating the Charter until the OAS decides to take energic actions.
19. Constantly  shown his friendship with countries and their leaders who are clear enemies of democracy( Cuba, Iraq, Iran, Libya) and a special relationship with the FARC, in Colombia
 
The National Security Strategy of the US contemplates that they will support those countries that defend human dignity( right to vote, freedom of speech, of property, etc) and oppose those who are against it. This is the moment for the US to back up this important statement of  foreign policy.

Dear Ms. Torres, you write my response to your request is too long and general. Can you understand this?

(Ms. Torres you wrote) "...I am still not sure what is the activity you refer to in your business plan. Can you tell me in a couple of sentences? I understand you are looking for a business contact in Israel. Who would be a good match for your business plan?..."


QUESTION NUMBER ONE. "...what is the activity you refer to in your business plan. Can you tell me in a couple of sentences? "

..ANSWER TO QUESTION NUMBER ONE.
 
....SENTENCE 1: Yes.

Consult and advise individuals, companies, entities and governments and to raise and invest funds into for-profit* and not-for-profit ventures that benefit world humanitarian and ethical issues involving health, the economy, jobs and the sanctity of the workplace, all subject to and in conformity with applicable law and good ethics....(* for-profit being often SBA 8(a), veterans, women, minority small  and medium size businesses,) in fields including without limitation, Communications, and legal and financial services,and of course, as customary there are no guarantees.


....SENTENCE NUMBER TWO 2..subject to sufficient approvals and funding...the provision of an integrated approach that would bring together the capabilities of information technology, organizational management, marketing and capital investment to develop or provide a system that could be used to (1) provide proof-of-concepts(s) for any or all of the Communications Clearinghouse components: the Confidential computer-based Patient Record (including the Biowar Early Warning System module), the Media Communications Company, and/or the Monetary Communications Company, (2) demonstrate their utility and cost effectiveness, and (3) implement them, making them available, globally. 


QUESTION NUMBER TWO. 

"Who would be a good match for your business plan?..."
(HERE IN ISRAEL)

ANSWER TO QUESTION NUMBER TWO.
             
AT THE GOVERNMENT LEVEL - THE STATE OF ISRAEL..THE PM
...(IMPLEMENTATION POSSIBLY)......ALOUF PIKUD HAORIF

      
AT THE PRIVATE LEVEL:

........THIS ANSWER IS IN PROCESS AND WILL BE FORTH COMING.


Ms. Torres can you understand this? If not, please ask the Ambassador to help me understand what you do not see? The response is as you requested, in answer to 2 questions you required with the 1st requiring an answer in 2 sentences. There are approximately 81 words in the 1st sentence. The US Income Tax Code has 277 words in 1 sentence, so the amount of words can not be a problem as the US Government requires every US Citizen to be able to understand a sentence with 277 words in it. The 2nd sentence has approximately 83 words. This sentence parallels the sentence in a reference letter from Dr. Henry Krakauer the US Government Specialist for Epediemology in the Secretary's Office of the Department of Health and Human Services of the United States of America.

The above is to your question number 1. Your question number 2 is answered in approximately 10 words. 

This is your format.

What is it you do not see and is it possible the Ambassador will understand it?



Very respectfully,



Stephen A. L. Rothschild

URGENT

E-mail  Delivery

February 3, 2003


US Department of Commerce associated with the United States Embassy in
Israel
Ms. Yael Torres
ytorres@mail.doc.gov
Tel in Israel: 03-519-7611

Dear Ms. Torres:

This is an alternate e-mail from the rothschildbanc@lycos.com, referenced,
below, which is filling up on capacity.

It was very nice meeting you by telephone, today. It is as the result of speaking with the US Ambassador's assistant who referred me to Ms. Hammond who referred me to the Commerce Deparment which resulted in our speaking by telephone. This is the e-mail we discussed.

As mentioned, I am urgently and respectfully re-proposing and requesting by this writing a Consulting Agreement with the United States as a Client at
the earliest possible date concerning (1) A Biowar Interned Inteactive Early Warning System as described herein and, including without limitation (2) Think Tank services. In this connection, my company has been awarded as set out on the followig web site: http://www.sba8a.com/yr04/fl102197.htm, an SBA 8(a) participation,  and a US Government and Commercial Entity Number of 053J5.

Of course there are many sole source methods available for the Contract in addition to the SBA 8(a) which are all sufficient in and of themselves, but it is a plausible addition. The proposed Consulting Agreement, from a not-for-profit, non partison and non-political division of the Company set out here is for Think Tank services for the US and where appropriate, ISRAEL, and others agreeable to them are in the "third wave of think tank" traditions as set out by Richard Haass, Director of Policy and Planning of the U.S. Department of State, in his recent article entitled "THINK TANKS
AND U.S. FOREIGN POLICY: A POLICY-MAKERS PERSPECTIVE with the capabilities of the Company set out in the Company web site at: http;//'stephenalrothschild.tripod.com. The Company's advocasy, controversy resolution, economic, advisory, research and development capabilities along with its other capabilities in information systems development, social and environmental infrastructure development, advanced research and technology development acquisition and as listed on the respective web sites are all present there as well as in the references
and referals at http://angelfire.com/super/aim. The Company's issue focus is set out in the references web sites in both the domestic and foreign policy areas.

The Company's primay proposal for Consulting Agreement from its for-profit area hereby re-proposed is for the following services regarding The Biowar Interactive Early Warning and Security Defense System (the "System") which was submitted in 1997 during the prior Administration was to be appropriately and properly implemented and to make America ready with a
>secure homeland defense, then, and it has not been implemented or presented to the President, yet, but rather misappropriated and set-on an improper
track. It may be too late to perform its appropriate and proper implementation before the next Biowar attack, if we do not act, now. As the proposed System protected individual privacy, as well, its delay has caused the Bush administration and the American public terribly severe and unnecessary headaches, worry and disunity at a time when America and America's president deserve responses and solutions building for unity and security. In all humility and modesty it is time to stand up to the job of putting in the right defense for America and her allies. The Biowar
Interactive Warning System as proposed is believed far
faster (over 200% plus) and more pervasive than the new Bioterror Monitor technique announced, last week. Knowing, of course, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, there can be no guarantees, the Biowar Early
>Warning System as proposed, before and now, here, appropriately and properly implemented, would, in all humility and modesty (1) provide you and the President, the Commerce Department, the Terrorist Threat Integration Center and the President's Counterproliferation Technology Coordination Committee, and American and her Allies, with the necessary, but missing and critically vital earliest real-time instrumentation revealing subtle suspicious vital life sign deviations among vast populations (2) while protecting and enhancing the privacy rights of the people, (3) and enabling the greatest in-time response for the most effective deterrence and mitigation protecting Americans and America's
allies. But, the Biowar Early Warning and Defense System is still delayed since March 31st, 1997, by the prior administration, while America is facing its
greatest terrorists risks. It was on or about that date I submitted a Proposal for the System to DARPA and others in the prior Administration by which I provided The Biowar Interactive Early Warning System White Paper forecasting the likelihood of sneak anthrax and other sneak biowar attacks against Americans and America's allies' and their populations. The Biowar Early Warning System was proposed for implementation in 1997 as the only suitable instrument to begin protecting Americans and America's allies
>against the unwarranted risks perceived to exist at that time and shown to have been, unfortunately, all too correct. This is a re-proposal, delayed by disruptive circumstances (1) respectfully and urgently requesting an Initial Consulting Agreement for an even improved Biowar Interactive Early Warning System, recommended by Dr. Nancy Miller, (former) United States Air Force Acquisition and Program Manager, set out below, together with John F. McCarthy, Jr, attorney, a key partner in America's and the world's largest labor law firm practicing exclusively in America, (2) including a One Page Summary, attached. The part of the balance of this letter describes the
current situation, in which almost five (5) years after submission, finally, by letter Dated January 4, 2002, Dr. Anna Johnson-Winegar, Ph.D., with whom I first had contact at Chemical/Biological Defense in 1999, thanks me for..."...(your)...support of the DoDChemical and biological Defense Program and for the welfare of U. S. Military forces.." as I had been continuing attempts during the prior administration to gain implementation of the Biowar Early Warning System
>before American lives and resources which would be saved, were tragically lost. Dr. Anna Johnson-Winegar's response  was most revealingly and perhaps
with all due respect to her, courageous, as regarding one of the several continued submission's during the Clinton administration and well before the September 11, 2001 attacks. She disclosed that the Department had been only involved in a process for "..identifying outbreaks of non-battle related illnesses for the deployed soldiers...(and)...also working closely
with civilian public health services as they develop methodologies.." but nothing more and nothing had
>been mentioned to have been conceived or implemented for the comprehensive Biowar Early Warning and Defense System implementation proposed by me as an integrative contractor to provide the American population and those of America's allies with the comprehensive deterrence and mitigation protection offered by the System which was offered during the prior Administration in 1997. Now, once the tragedy of September 11, 2001, and the time related anthrax deaths occurred, Dr. Anna Johnson-Winegar is
quoted as saying "shame on us" for not acting earlier. Indeed. 

So they have announced they will do something, now, after receiving repeated proposals to provide the System and after September 11, 2001, occurred, by using the trade secreted ideas/concepts without consent of the proponent and by spending $300,000,000 on it, but, they are admitting they do not have a model, only the ideas I tradesecreted and submitted.
Moreover, they admittedly do not know how to implement it and, as a consequence they are running late, on the wrong path, and causing the Bush administration and America great unnecessary problems and greater risks.
>Let American's admit we can no longer be tied to the prior administration's continuing inaction and methods of denial resulting in no defense or a sham defense from which the Bush Administration will have to
dig out. If given a real chance, I will go forward as the owner of the intellectual property and the author of and one who presented it trade secreted, with a good tradesecreted model to provide the Bush
administration and the American people and America's allies better humanitarian and ethical safeguards, better public acceptance, better public appreciation and better implementation than evidenced by the
languishing years of the prior administration's fiddling. Please allow me to help in response to President Bush's assessment that .."..The United
States has a critical need for cutting-edge technology that can quickly and effectively detect, analyze, facilitate interdiction of, defend against, defeat, and mitigate the consequences of WMD (weapons of mass
destruction)..." The Biowar Interactive Early Warning and Defense System, properly implemented will help you do that better than otherwise possible giving you more time to breath, as did the Integrated Approach for the New York Times I presented resulted in a milestone for the world's greatest newspaper in the management of electronic news records. My e-mail address is the most reliable contact as I am some distance from Washington,

Hi everybody:

Please keep Rodney Sanchez in your thoughts and prayers...  

We have worked together in a couple of different assignments with the Miami-Dade Police Department...he was a brand new Special Response Team (SRT/SWAT) officer on my team in 1988 to 1992 and was on my Crime Suppression Team at Miami Intl Airport for a few years in 1999.  He left MDPD, joining the Florida Dept. of Law Enforcement (FDLE), immediately assigned to the Governor's protection detail.  He now works for Uncle Sam as a Captain in the U.S. Army.

Rod is an outstanding police officer/special agent/soldier and most importantly...a dad.  Please let him know occasionally that what he is doing for us is appreciated.  I can assure you he will represent us with honor, courage and integrity, because he already has a proven track record of same.

Thanks for helping support a great guy.  I'll forward news when received.

who supported you.  Please honor 3 separate acts of congress that promised 
this area would not be taken.  If citizens can't count on 3 acts of congress 
to protect them then the rule of law no longer exists in this country and 
citizens are denied the security and the ability to plan their lives.  
Property Rights is a basic tenet of our Constitution.  Don't destroy it.

Thank you,

Lynn Barry

Dear Governor Bush,

http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/020503/met_11662361.shtml

Please read this article written about our son; he is a prime example why 
the Bright Futures money is not
being wasted.  He conceived, researched and financed this project on his 
own with the approval of the
New College of Florida faculty sponsor and with our support and blessings.

Because of the nature and scope of this project, he got additional 
permission to be off campus.  With our
help, and through contacts he has made over the years, he was able to 
involve experienced tradesmen
and professionals.  St Augustine is the perfect historical backdrop for 
such a creative endeavor (although to
the best of my knowledge, the Romans never ventured this far).

New College offers an enormous opportunity to high performing students who 
have creative minds and are
willing to challenge themselves. I guarantee you that he worked very hard 
to earn his place at New College,
which he wanted over any other state or national university.  He sacrificed 
greatly to EARN a 4.5 GPA, and
graduate in the top of his class.

He worked very hard and met the criteria for Bright Futures. Although, 
summer school was eliminated, he
got special permission to take additional classes. In addition, he availed 
himself of several duel enrollment
and AP classes to prepare himself for college.  Because we believed that 
these monies were guaranteed
and supported through lottery dollars, we encouraged him not to get a job 
and to concentrate on his studies.

My husband has been injured and is off on unemployment.  I have a small 
cleaning business.  We have all
we can do to make ends meet. If you change the Bright Futures benefits and 
raise tuition and housing expenses
it will make a huge difference in all our lives.

The students of Florida were promised if they excelled at school they would 
be rewarded.  They have accomplished
their part, please do not let them down!  Our education system needs all 
the help it can get, and so do our students!

Sincerely,
Kate & Richard Parkhurst

Governor Bush:

First, please accept my very belated congratulations on your re-election.  As you can imagine I was pleased, but never in doubt as to the outcome!  We all look forward to the continuing four years and beyond.  

You've been so responsive and helpful to me in the past; I wonder if I may come to you for guidance once again.  The communication below broadly describes an escalating event that we believe offers significant economic harm to Florida business, specific to international trade.  Melissa Freedman has worked very hard to develop a dialog with U.S. Customs; however, the solution they have extended to her is, in our opinion, not a solution at all, and, once deployed, irreversible; the damage to business irreparable.  We have also attempted to reach Dr. Dana but understand her office does not work with these issues.   Perhaps we do not understand the proper avenue of communication...

Can you please describe to me the most effective and concise method to use to earn your attention on this issue, so that you can then review and determine if it is meritorious enough to earn the resources of your staff?

We are a constituent company with offices in Miami and Tampa; our client base is global, with nomenclature including thousands private and public entities.  I am happy to provide whatever information may be of use in determining the merits of our case.

Your comments and questions are encouraged; thank you in advance for your consideration.

		Importance:	High

		Hello Melissa:

		Thank you for your time this afternoon and especially for your willingness to expedite this matter for us.  The attached link to the Federal Register identifies the deadline for public comment as Monday, February 10, 2002.  As a constituent business with offices in Tampa and Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, we request advocacy from your office:  specifically, submission of a letter in response to the Federal Register notice for public comment.  A sample or template of suggested copy is attached for your review and consideration.

		Here are the most critical discussion points:

		Economic Harm to Florida Business:    In addition to severely restricting the marketing, economic development, competitive intelligence and strategic planning activities of Florida business engaged in international trade, the proposed ruling will restrict the decisioning tools of foreign companies who use this data to identify potential Florida business counterparts, or key traffic areas for site selection and plant expansion.  

		Business interests include but are not limited to manufacturers  (chemical, equipment, hardware, textile, etc.), pharmaceutical companies, NVOCCs, banks, railroads, freight forwarders, custom house brokers, trade development agencies, importers and exporters, and law firms; example:  the Florida Ports Council uses this data in developing and implementing economic and business development initiatives vital to the growth of international commerce in Florida.  

		Duplication of an Effective, Existing Law:  The proposed ruling duplicates the Trade Act of 1930 that contains an automatic system for protecting the confidentiality of the identities of importers and consignees.  See 19 C.F.R. § 103.31(d)(1); 19 U.S.C. § 1431(c)(1)(A).  It also contains a procedure to bar publication of manifest data about a particular cargo shipment whenever the Secretary of the Treasury determines that publication may harm national security, or may cause personal injury or property damage.  These well-established procedures strike the balance between preserving national security, facilitating public disclosure of manifest information, and enabling parties interested in doing so to protect their confidentiality.
		The current rule for biennial confidentiality certifications works well, with more than 1,200 exporters and 1,700 importers making use of the biennial confidentiality certification procedure.  During the 22 years that the current rule has been in effect, the confidentiality provisions have generated very few complaints from those that file confidentiality certifications, and PIERS is frequently in contact with Customs' Disclosure Law Branch to ensure that shipper confidentiality is maintained.
		Undermining of Congressional Policy; No Credible Contribution to Port Security:  This proposal originated in response to comments filed in the rulemaking proceedings for the "24 hour rule" - an initiative designed to increase port and maritime security.  Yet, reducing the amount of vessel cargo information released will not increase security.  It will, however, seriously harm trade and law enforcement activities that rely extensively upon the availability of this information through PIERS and other information services. 

		Florida clients who have submitted letters of support for our position include the Greater Tampa Chamber of Commerce and the Florida Ports Council.

		Your comments and questions are encouraged.  For additional information or clarification:

Subject:	Bright Futures Program 




Dear Governor Bush, 

Our family made the choice to relocate to Florida from Colorado in 2002.  One of the major deciding factors was Florida's Bright Futures program.  We have three children and because of the stock market doing so poorly, we were looking forward to using the Bright Futures program to help with their education.

We have given this information to several Colorado residents who are thinking of relocating to the South.  It was a toss up between Florida and Georgia.  I understand that Georgia also has an excellent scholarship program for their citizens, but due to many other conservative and business issues we have almost persuaded them to move their business and work to Florida.  

My husband and I have been life long Republicans and have supported Republicans 100%.  Governor Bush has been the guest speaker at several dinners my husband has attended and he has come away impressed with his vision for Florida. However, if the Bright Futures Program is eliminated, it will be very hard to support Republicans with signs in our yard, bumper stickers on our cars and talking to neighbors and friends at election time, etc.

We realize this was not what you wanted, but because the vote for smaller classes passed, you have to get the money from some where.  Please do not eliminate or alter the Bright Futures program.  This would be taking away a promise that you have made to the citizens of Florida.  These citizens are the ones that are trying to better themselves by earning a College Degree.  These citizens are the one's who will remember Republicans are the people that helped them earn this degree.  They will also remember you at future elections.  

Your name will always be remembered by several things that you do.   Let the citizens remember that Republicans kept Bright Futures going strong for all the Florida residents that choose to work hard for a better tomorrow.

Sincerely,

Dianne Davis

Governor,

I am gratified that you want to recognize the Florida National Guard in your
State of the State speech.  My recommendation would be to have two families
of deployed Florida National Guard personnel present during your speech.
They could be in the gallery and you could recognize them while commenting
on the missions that their soldiers are doing. 

We can provide background on the soldiers, their missions and their
families.  You could also recognize Rep. Baker's family if they are in
attendance.  The challenge with using a VTC or film is that our soldiers in
a potential war zone may have very limited access to a VTC or film
equipment. That is not to say that we may have the opportunity between now
and then (only three weeks) to get something on Video from them.  I have
specific ideas on the soldiers' families that you could invite and I will
discuss this with Ms. Shanahan tomorrow.

Subject: Child Support Enforcement??


Governor Bush,
 
I have a major concern regarding the Child Support Enforcement Department. 
I have not received any child support from my ex-husband since spring of last year. He does not live in Florida and has resided in Ohio 
for the last 6 years. At first his excuse was that he had been laid off. Then it was that he had surgery on his heel and was unable to work 
until he got a release from the doctor. NOW since November he has totally dropped out of sight. No one knows where he is. So I finally 
had had ENOUGH of his lack of responsibility to his children! 
I went online and found the Child Support Enforcement site and downloaded the application form that is suppose to assist me in locating and 
enforcing the child support "court order". After 3 weeks I finally got a response from them. Enclosed in the envelope they sent me was 3 forms 
and a request. The request was for copies of my 2 daughters birth certificates. One form was a financial affidavit WITH a description of myself in 
the form. One was an affidavit of child support arrearage. And the last form (Application for Services) was a form that I already filled out and 
signed when I submitted the application with $25 the first time. I knew there was alot of wasted time and money in the Dept. of Family Services 
but this is outrageous! WHY do they need my daughter's birth certificates??? Paternity s NOT an issue. I have a COURT ORDER  from a Martin 
County judge ordering the children's father to pay 915.09 a month! I also have a payroll deduction order in place that was going through Tallahassee 
when he was working. Both of these orders I copied included with the application. And why do I need to fill out a financial affidavit with a description 
of myself in it???? I'm not the deadbeat parent here.... HE IS!!! 
I'm not asking the state for money or food stamps. All I want is assistance enforcing an already EXISITING child support order. The state has all the 
information that was required in the application in order to at least TRY to locate him. 
Instead of being treated like the responsible parent .. I'm being treated like I've got something to prove.  I'm doing the best I can at trying to keep our 
heads above water with paying the bills and supporting 2 teenage girls all alone. All I want is some help enforcing a child support order that is still in 
place which the Child Support Enforcement Dept has copies of!! What more do they need???
The request for the birth certificates.. the Financial Affidavit and the Application for Services is redundant. A total waste of my time... the states time.. 
and taxpayers money! As far as I'm concerned the only legitimate form in the envelope that was sent to me was the Affidavit of Child Support Arrearage.
I'm at my wits end. Any suggestions you might have in expediting this situation would be truly appreciated. 
Thank you for your time in reading my letter.
 
 
Respectfully,
 
Debra Lemon

Mr. Bush,
    I just read an article on cnn's page about your brother wanting to lift the minimum rent for gov't housing... i can not beleive that such a communistic economic policy actually exists in this country! I'm in school and paying moe than 10x that much for rent, but i don't see anyone in the gov't crying too much for me. I hope out president gets this horrible far-left attribute of our society elliminated and would like to know your thoughts on it.

As I think you know Pres. King is with us and in the end so is the Speaker.  Its hard fighting against the disinformation machine that the trial lawyers have.  What we essentially asking the legislature is to do what 30 other state do and include nursing homes in the med mal law.  The trial lawyers are now reduced to the argument that we really don't provide "healthcare".  I think we waxed them  on that point in the select committee Monday.  

   In our statute " healthcare providers"  include not only docs and hospitals but physical therapists, chiropractor, naturalpaths?,blood banks, hospital run rehab centers, podiatrists the list includes everyone but nursing home and we are out due to the past politcal strength of Wilkes and the rest the trial bar.  We need a push.  We are close but the select committee will conclude next Wednesday and I think they agree with us but no leader has emerged.  Sorry  to go on and on but the trail lawyers are getting to me.  If you could urge the committee  to treat nursing homes like other healthcare providers and hospitals it would be huge.  I know you heading out of the country so I hate to ask but whatever you could do before you go might make the difference.  You probably regret asking but thanks for asking and your all you have done on behalf of nursing homes.  Brian

Yes I know and I really appreciate that.  Unfortunately in the process of setting it up I'm told that some members of the sen thought it would be wrong for the Sen Pres to do this before the committee votes.  Even though he has said on the record of the support of our issue and even though he wanted to do the press conf he is now going to wait until after the committee votes and give our effort big mo as the session begins.  My fear is theat while we wait for that we die in the select committee.  So at the risk of being a major pain could you do it without him this week?  I know its asking a lot with the demands on your time so I understand either way.  Thanks, Brian

Sources in the bay area tell me law enforcement is about to ratchet up the

increased state of alert warranted at this time? Should we still go about

I already know the answers to these questions . . .  but I need them on tape

If you can't answer the question -- or work it into your prepared remarks --

Subject: Child Support Enforcement??


Governor Bush,
 
I have a major concern regarding the Child Support Enforcement
Department. 
I have not received any child support from my ex-husband since spring
of
last year. He does not live in Florida and has resided in Ohio 
for the last 6 years. At first his excuse was that he had been laid
off.
Then it was that he had surgery on his heel and was unable to work 
until he got a release from the doctor. NOW since November he has
totally dropped out of sight. No one knows where he is. So I finally 
had had ENOUGH of his lack of responsibility to his children! 
I went online and found the Child Support Enforcement site and
downloaded the application form that is suppose to assist me in
locating
and 
enforcing the child support "court order". After 3 weeks I finally got
a
response from them. Enclosed in the envelope they sent me was 3 forms 
and a request. The request was for copies of my 2 daughters birth
certificates. One form was a financial affidavit WITH a description of
myself in 
the form. One was an affidavit of child support arrearage. And the
last
form (Application for Services) was a form that I already filled out
and

signed when I submitted the application with $25 the first time. I
knew
there was alot of wasted time and money in the Dept. of Family Services

but this is outrageous! WHY do they need my daughter's birth
certificates??? Paternity s NOT an issue. I have a COURT ORDER  from a
Martin 
County judge ordering the children's father to pay 915.09 a month! I
also have a payroll deduction order in place that was going through
Tallahassee 
when he was working. Both of these orders I copied included with the
application. And why do I need to fill out a financial affidavit with
a
description 
of myself in it???? I'm not the deadbeat parent here.... HE IS!!! 
I'm not asking the state for money or food stamps. All I want is
assistance enforcing an already EXISITING child support order. The
state
has all the 
information that was required in the application in order to at least
TRY to locate him. 
Instead of being treated like the responsible parent .. I'm being
treated like I've got something to prove.  I'm doing the best I can at
trying to keep our 
heads above water with paying the bills and supporting 2 teenage girls
all alone. All I want is some help enforcing a child support order
that
is still in 
place which the Child Support Enforcement Dept has copies of!! What
more
do they need???
The request for the birth certificates.. the Financial Affidavit and
the
Application for Services is redundant. A total waste of my time... the
states time.. 
and taxpayers money! As far as I'm concerned the only legitimate form
in
the envelope that was sent to me was the Affidavit of Child Support
Arrearage.
I'm at my wits end. Any suggestions you might have in expediting this
situation would be truly appreciated. 
Thank you for your time in reading my letter.
 
 
Respectfully,
 
Debra Lemon

Subject:	Statewide Impact Fee

There is a very interesting series of articles on the Miami-Dade Schools 
at the following Web addresses, which all point out in this school district wasteful spending,
poor planning, lack of accountability, and an unending thirst for more funding. These are all items
I have stated that need to be addressed by the PCSB and reported to the voters now and on an ongoing basis,
and this system of keeping the public 110% informed of how, when, and where all money is spent by 
the PCSB will have to be in place BEFORE voters will feel confident enough to pass any referendum 
that is an increase of self imposed taxes. The Senate Bill introduced Friday 02/07/03 for a 
Statewide impact Fee imposed on the citizens of this state is a good example of taxation without representation,
and a very sneaky and underhanded blow to the hardworking taxpayers in this state,
and I oppose it ! I will do all I can to make sure the public is informed of this Bill also.

I also refer to an article on  the front page of Friday, February 7 Wall Street Journal entitled "Oil Powerhouses Vow to Intervene To Avert a Shortage if War Comes".  This price increase is not necessary as we both know and is only gouging in anticipation of a fictitious shortage.  Please do something.

Jeb,
Wanted to forward this over to you as you have always been prompt with your emails and that is so appreciated.  
Dear Governor Perdue,  Across the states and regardless of financial stature, I have repeatedly heard parents perplexed by their 'child' feeling that they are owed every and anything. Reply by parent is 'when I was your age, I had to work for what I wanted'. Sound familiar ?  The only common denominator is the 'Public School System'. From my 25 yr. old down to my 11 yr. old I (in great research) have discovered that students in the "Health Class" in cirriculum are being taught of "Economic Abuse" encompassed with Verbal & Emotional abuse. I asked if I yell at you, what is that called ? Reply: verbal abuse. If I call you stupid, what is that called ? Reply: emotional abuse. If you talk back to me with words of hateful dissent, what is that called ? Reply: being disrespectful. So, I as a parent can be put in jail for verbal and emotional and economic abuse, but you as a child/young adult have no consequences for the same action ?  
I will be forwarding this same email over to Jeb Bush (Florida Governor jeb@jeb.org).  
Federal funds (baiting system) are training children to be unaccountable, irresponsible, crude and abusive young adults! How can you wonder why parents, teachers and elders are given little if any respect from this generation. 
As an active Republican I PRAY that you will do more than push it under the rug and ignore as did your Democratic predecessor!
I greatly look forward to your response !!!!!

An amazing part of this story is that when Brittany was an infant we were told by the professionals that she would never walk or talk.  Today she attends a special education transition program at Florida Southern College, she lives in a supported-living home in the greater community and we believe she is close to landing her first "real job".

Even more amazing is the fact that Brittany's independence has been made possible by a focused group of proactive parents and a series of partnerships between Noah's Ark and the Polk County Schools, Florida Southern College, the First United Methodist Church in Lakeland and local area businesses.

The home Brittany now lives in was built using donations from local businesses and the church along with volunteers from the community (copying Habitat For Humanity's successful concept).

The three young ladies that live at Noah's Landing (our tag name for this initiative) each have unique needs and support systems.  Holli receives services through the "consumer-directed care" demonstration program, Heather receives services through the traditional medicaid waiver program and Brittany remains on the waiting-list but receives support and mentoring from family and volunteers from the Noah's Ark organization.

Jeb, for the past four years you have been encouraging and promoting creative grass-root initiatives, leveraging resources through business and spiritual community partnerships and expanding mentoring and volunteerism.  Noah's Ark has "bundled" all these efforts into one incredibly successful initiative.  But the time has come to take our initiatives to a higher level and we need your help.

On Thursday evening, March 6th, Noah's Ark is having a volunteer and donor appreciation dinner in Lakeland.  We would like to extend an invitation to you and Columba to participate.  

We know both of your schedules are very full, but we believe your participation would give individuals with developmental disabilities statewide media attention, which would help educate the general public on their needs and problems.  It would encourage local area businesses and houses of worship to become part of the solution.  It would also help to inspire other parent groups around the state and give them hope for their children's future.

If there a small crack in your schedule on the evening of March 6th we would love to have you and Columba help us celebrate.

Sincerely,

Jack Kosik
One Proud Dad

Importance:	High

Governor, 

The Florida National Guard annually hosts a Junior Reserve Officer Training
Corps (JROTC) summer camp at Camp Blanding.  To conduct this camp, we have
invested significant resources, both personnel and equipment.  Due to the
current mobilization posture of the Florida National Guard and the potential
for additional mobilizations, I have made the decision to withdraw Florida
National Guard personnel and equipment support for the JROTC camp.  The high
operations tempo of our units, the monetary cost of replacing mobilized
soldiers on our full-time staff and the criticality of our recruiters
assisting families of mobilized soldiers while maintaining our personnel
strength led me to this decision.  

JROTC will still be welcome to conduct their camp at Camp Blanding and will
be treated in the professional manner we treat all our customers at Camp
Blanding.  I am in the process of notifying the Commanding General of Army
Cadet Command, the Army's senior command for JROTC.

I wanted to provide this information in case you received inquiries on this
issue.  I appreciate your understanding of this decision which allows us to
concentrate our limited resources on unit readiness.

Regards,

Doug

More good news from Collegis. Strong revenue growth  -- $95 million -- despite a slow economy and cutbacks in higher education. We're a Florida-based company to watch and would still love to have you visit our offices in Maitland (I haven't been able to get on your schedule yet.)

Collegis posts record revenues despite budget cuts and belt-tightening measures in higher education 

Revenues of $95 million reflect demand for technology services among colleges and universities 

(Maitland, Fla. -- February 13, 2003) -- Collegis, the higher education advantage, earned record revenues in 2002, posting $95 million in revenues, up 35 percent from one year ago. This growth comes in the face of a slow economy, a flurry of state budget cuts to higher education and shrinking endowments at many of the nation's private colleges and universities.

Collegis, based in suburban Orlando, Fla., provides comprehensive business and technology services to nearly 100 colleges and universities throughout the nation. The corporation signed new and expanded business agreements with 36 clients in 2002, and received favorable results in client satisfaction surveys among its higher education client institutions. Collegis' diversified services include managing networks, supporting academic and administrative applications and redesigning curriculum programs for today's learners.

The $95 million in revenues represent the best sales year in the corporation's 16-year history, and point to an increased commitment on the part of college and university administrators who seek guidance, management and leadership expertise to handle an increasing variety of technology-related issues on campus. Collegis entered 2003 with nearly $86 million of revenues in contractual backlog to be realized throughout the course of the year.

New higher education clients signed by Collegis in 2002 include: Loyola Marymount University (Calif.), Claremont Graduate University (Calif.), Seattle University (Wash.), University of Bridgeport (Conn.), Merrimack College (Mass.), Community College of Philadelphia (Pa.) and many others.

The 2002 growth also witnessed the creation and development of Collegis' Curriculum Solutions unit, which tailors blended (online and in-class) academic content, such as certificate and degree-seeking programs, for adult learners in information technology (IT), healthcare, education and business. Collegis Curriculum Solutions clients include University of Louisville (Ky.), Benedictine University (Ill.), Texas Southern University (Texas), Drake University (Iowa) and University of District of Columbia (D.C.), to name a few.

"What we're seeing is the willingness among colleges and universities to get creative with course offerings to meet the needs of a changing work force," said Tom Huber, Collegis CEO and president. "There also exists a trend toward outsource technology management to free themselves of the complexities of providing technology services on their own. Collegis works in partnership with its clients to allow them to focus on teaching and learning, while our efforts provide the technology expertise to enhance that teaching and learning and help increase efficiencies for students, faculty and staff across the campus operation."

About Collegis Inc.
Founded in 1986, Collegis Inc. provides comprehensive business and technology services to higher education. Collegis, the higher education advantage, helps colleges and universities advance their technology by managing networks, supporting academic and administrative applications and by redesigning curriculum programs for today's learners. Collegis partners with institutions to stabilize IT costs, increase revenues and better serve students and faculty by offering unparalleled knowledge, expertise and accountability with product-neutral technology services and solutions exclusive to higher education.

Subject:	JEPESSON VISION QUEST

Importance:	High

Dear Honorable Governor, 
        As you know nurses do not make good politician's. We are generally happier in the trenches. However, I really am compelled to implore you not to cut the Vision Quest program. I was a school nurse for 7 years and now supervise that program. You just can't imagine what a nightmare it was before we had vision quest trying to obtain eye exams and glasses for our children!  Occasionally we could scrounge for glasses, beg the optometrists to repair old ones, but get a free or low cost exam? No way!  Children often have a dramatic change in their vision in or about the 3rd grade and then again in Middle School. Just when we expect them to take FCAT, Florida Writes, Be able to see the classroom board, or overheads clearly...and they simply cannot!! by the time we can find a resource, they have lost precious time!

        I would gladly send testomony from parents, kids and teachers who have been so appreciative. Eye exams cost 40-90$ and then glasses another 60-200$! Vision Quest allows a choice for glasses that aren't "dorky" also. I'm sure you can remember kids who would "lose", or "break" their glasses frequently because they were so embarrassed to wear them!

        Vision Quest provides us with prompt response to our referrals, contacts the parents, makes arrangements with local practitioners, and then reports the outcomes! It is truly a Godsend!

PLEASE, PLEASE CONSIDER FUNDING THIS PROGRAM. LOSS OF IT WILL TRULY IMPACT OUR STATE'S CHILDREN! 

MOST SINCERELY, 
ELIZABETH

Dear Governor Bush: 

I would like - - if at all possible -- to see if you can take 5 minutes out of your busy schedule to meet with Mr. and Mrs. Leopold Fernandez Peals.

Leopold is a well known businessman that became a legend in Spain when he resigned as General Manager of Johnson & Johnson and opened the first pizzeria in Madrid, called Tele-Pizza.  Years later and after opening 800 pizzerias restaurants throughout Spain and France he sold his business for 1.6 billion dollars, he has residences in Madrid, Nassau and Fisher Island in Miami.

He and his Spanish born wife Marilina, are very interesting people and great admirer of the Bush family especially you.   He has several important businesses in Madrid, Segovia and also in Ocala, Florida.

If at all possible we will meet at your convenience, the meeting will be short, not Cuban style.

To Whom It May Concern:
 
I have just received information as to eliminating the regulation of talent agencies. I am appalled at the idea of this since it will open up this state to every unsavory scheme around. Do you realize the amount of persons in this state that will spend their last dollar to be a star? This is what they are told and this is not what happens.
 
Our industry is a multi billion dollar industry to the State of Florida, and as hard as we as a trade association work to provide our people with information about scams they still come in and operate until they are caught and run out of the state. Without regulations we will be overrun.
 
If you care anything about the people of Florida, I hope you will re-look this situation. At a time when you are looking at de-regulating talent agencies, you should be looking at how to enforce the regulations already on the books.
 
At a time when we are looking to bring more films, commercials, and print work to Florida we need to know our people will be protected from the scams. I the DBPR can't handle this than I suggest another department take it on and we will do all we can to help out. Our people are always ready to help.
 
Please reconsider this action until a better plan can be found. Thank you for you time and feel free to contact me if you should need any further information.

Subject:	Cuts to kill our childrens' vision

Mr. J. Bush, Governor of Florida: 

I am sending this message on behalf of hundreds of students in my school, McLane Middle 
School, Brandon, Florida. 


We are almost (soon will be!) a Title I school, with 24% Latinos, almost 49% African 
American and 5% Asian.  Our population is HEAVY on the immigrant scale, and the majority do not have money for eye exams and/or eye glasses. 


I don't need to tell you (or anyone else) that without healthy vision, NO CHILD CAN LEARN 
TO READ...or write. 


The Jeppesen VisionQuest in Hillsborough County has impacted tremendously upon the general academic excellence....simply because they provided the windows on the world for our at-risk students. 


I work with the bilingual language arts/reading program (currently in my fifth year), and this year I have 18 different nations represented in my four classes.  I have been able to obtain 
eye exams and glasses for dozens of my students...who otherwise would not have had them.  Other teachers of US-born students also sing the praises of Jeppesen VisionQuest. 


The results have been true eye openers!  The students have succeeded...and in most instances, 
excelled...academically, and in areas of self-esteem. 


Sir, I fully understand that a leader can only stretch $$ so far, and that you are doing the very best you can in our present economic situation.  However, I am hoping and praying that some 
other avenue of revenue will present itself...so that our poor children can have healthy eyes...with which to learn about their state, their nation and their world.  Eyes that will help them to feel connected to the rest of society, help them to feel confident in their self-worth, and lead them boldly into their subsequent academic years...then on into adulthood. 


One day, these students whom we help achieve, through the vehicle of healthy eyes through 
FREE EXAMS & GLASSES, will be wage earners, voters and tax payers.  The largest majority of them are of excellent moral character...and will, therefore, GIVE BACK TO THE COMMUNITY, every good deed afforded them. 


Please, Mr. Governor...and Senator Pruitt...RECONSIDER the proposal to cut funds from the budget of the Jeppesen VisionQuest program.  OUR CHILDREN NEED THIS ASSISTANCE. 


Thank you sincerely.  I am,

Subject:	NCLB Tech Grants

Dear Governor Bush,

I'm hoping that Secty Paige will be able to fit Michael and I into his busy 
schedule next week (Wednesday, February 19th)...we're waiting to hear.  I'm 
sure you are aware of the "Tech Grants", but just in case...to me, NCLB is 
the best thing that has happened for education in a very long time!  :-)

Karen
Michael's MOM

http://www.nochildleftbehind.gov/start/facts/21centtech.html

    

    HOW TECHNOLOGY CAN WORK WELL IN SCHOOLS

    

    No Child Left Behind focuses on how teachers and students can use 
technology.

    Previous federal programs focused on increasing access to more 
technology. In

    an effort to improve student achievement through the use of technology, 
U.S.

    Secretary of Education Rod Paige announced a new Enhancing Education 
Through

    Technology (ED Tech) initiative.

    

    Percentage of students who reported using a computer at school at least 
once

    a week, by grade.

    

    The goals of Ed Tech grants are to:

    

    *   Improve student academic achievement through the use of technology in

    elementary schools and secondary schools.

    *   Assist students to become technologically literate by the time they

    finish the eighth grade.

    *   Ensure that teachers are able to integrate technology into the 
curriculum

    to improve student achievement.

    

    

    Technology must enhance learning.

    

    *   It's not enough simply to have a computer and an Internet connection 
in

    the classroom if they are not made part of the learning process.

    *   Technology is a tool like any other, and the value does not come from

    having access to it, but rather how it is used.

    *   ED Tech grants will improve the quality of education by developing new

    ways to apply this tool to teaching and learning.

    

    

    It expands options and provides better information on education.

    

    *   Several components of No Child Left Behind allow schools to purchase

    technology resources to support program goals. The result is technology

    aligned with specific goals tied to state academic standards.

    *   Online tests deliver reports on student progress instantaneously 
instead

    of weeks later. When designed well, curriculum software can engage 
students

    in solid academic curriculum like never before.

    

    

    

    Download this fact sheet. (It is in PDF format.)

Dear Teddy
Colin here, can you help me i networking, I know you have mmore contacts in higher places than I do.  My company that I was with has closed its doors and because I've been with them only just over 5 months, I am now not able to file for unemployment.  I am sending anywhere from 20 to 30 resumes a day, and because of the way things have been am not finding anything.  Do you know of anybody who needs someone such as my self with over 24 years of inside sales experience that could use my services.  As you know I'm legally blind and have never depended on government for anything.  I have been selling internet related services for the last 7 years, most of that time with Hydrogen Media which is no longer in business.
   Teddy if you know anyone please pass my info on to them.  I've been hit hard over the last year and am trying to find a company who would believe in me as well as me them.
Thanks and GOD BLESS

It was put to us that it was cut and dry and if he took a trial he would get more than 10 years.. he is only 27 at this time he would be 37 before getting out...if weapons where used against anyone he would deserve to do  10 years.

Govenor Bush
I would first like to let you know how my heart goes out to you everytime I hear about your daughter in trouble... Having raised a child with the same problems and going thru many rehabs it is a strain on the entire family..
Thats what brings me to writing today my son has been charged with the 10 20 life law and sentenced to 10 years in jail he took the plea because we could not afford a lawyer so he used a public deffender.
the weapons involved where  taken from a house he and others broke into and sold right to a gun dealer.. not used against anyone....
wasnt this law for repeat  offenders????
yes he needs  to pay for his crime but 10 years??? when 2 boys admit to killing there dad and only get 7 or 8 years... something is wrong with this system..
He was just getting his life in order and trying to help himself after trying to commit sucide  and now 10 years.... I pray every day that this law will be looked into and something done about it  at this time he is sending in a appeal to his sentencing...
I would appreciate it for any advice as to who to question about this matter...
Thank You

Governor,

I had a brief chat with Mr Busey today concerning the recognition of a
deployed Guardsman and member of the Legislature.  I think he has a very
good "blend" of the recognition of a mobilized soldier with the current
national focus on the GWOT. We have a good video in hand that will work.
Looking to get one from the "desert" in time for early March.

Regards,

DB

Dear Gov. Jeb,
  Subject: State Library. I understand that budgets must be met and some
things have to be cut. I don't mind so much that the State Library has to
go...but where is my interest. Either give the University of FL a one shot
of money to build a place to properly house the library, or find another
place for it that is accessible to the PUBLIC. It has PUBLIC
records/archives that belong to the PUBLIC. We paid for them and they are
there for our use.
  Would donations help? I don't know what the solution is, but I beg of you
to reconsider giving the archives to Nova University, which is a PRIVATE
entity. The PUBLIC needs access to these records that involve FL history.
  I am a genealogist, and this means a lot to me and many other people. Have
you considered FGCU? Seems like some people are willing to sponsor new
additions to this University.
  Belated Happy Birthday! Ilsa Lezgus

Querido Gobernador,
 
Tal y como me pidió, me permito transmitirle la información que pueda serle de utilidad de cara a su próxima visita a España.
 
La oposición socialista ha secundado la gran manifestación que tendrá lugar en Madrid el sábado 15 así como en 56 ciudades españolas. La previsión es que será multitudinaria.
 
El Gobierno del Partido Popular está explicando los argumentos que justifican nuestra posición en relación con la crisis de Iraq y que usted conoce muy bien.
 
Los mensajes que me permito aconsejarle a la vista de el estado de la opinión pública, serían los siguientes:
 

*	España es un aliado serio en la Coalición Internacional por la Libertad y contra el Terrorismo. 

*	USA está haciendo y hará todo lo posible para derrotar a ETA. 

*	USA es un aliado víctima del terrorismo y sabe apreciar la solidaridad de los amigos. 

*	España es un actor internacional comprometido con la paz y la seguridad y sabemos que es en los momentos difíciles cuando se mide la seriedad de los compromisos. 

*	A USA no le gusta la guerra, decir lo contrario es no conocer a un país como el mío comprometido con la defensa y de la democracia y los derechos humanos en el mundo. No hace tanto tiempo Europa pudo comprobar nuestro compromiso. 

*	España es el puente entre Europa y América porque representa lo mejor de la Europa de siempre y lo mejor de la Europa del siglo XXI. La España de hoy tiene una visión global. 

*	USA necesita una Europa fuerte y unida para defender la paz y la seguridad y luchar juntos contra el terrorismo.

Esperando saludarle de nuevo en Madrid, 
Sincerely yours

Gov. Bush:

I spoke with you briefly at a news conference after the release of death
row inmate Rudolph Holton. Last week, the Times ran a lengthy story about
his case. If you read the story, I am wondering what conclusions or
impressions you took from the case?

You have spoken about your interest into why two witnesses in the case
recanted. Has anything else about the case captured your attention or
concern? Has it raised any other issues that you would like the state to
address or study?

I'm particularly interested in your opinion about the use of jailhouse
informants in cases. Does this practice cause you any concern? Should
Florida place additional safeguards in place when prosecutors use and
juries rely on these kinds of witnesses?

As you know, this was one subject the Illinois Commission on Capital
Punishment studied. The commission recommended that juries be read special
instruction about evaluating informant testimony and prosecutors be
required to disclose all deals -- including all expectations of future
deals.

Thanks for your time.

Dear Jeb

Happy Birthday -- I'll hit the big fifty in July -- how's it feel???

A couple of more important things --

We are working on a letter to you (and the Speaker and the President of the Senate) outlining all the reasons we cannot conduct a 2nd Primary election under the current timeframe allowed by law.  We will attach a fact sheet explaining what we have to do to accomplish printing of ballots and court orders to get the absentees out, etc. under the current time frame so that everyone will have a clear understanding and not think we are just "too lazy" to conduct another election.  We have no problem conducting a 2nd Primary but the time frame must be changed in order for us to accomplish the job.  That would of course mean moving back the 1st Primary.  We are trying to get the signature of every supervisor in the state on the letter.

I am planning to meet with Ken Pruitt to see if we can possibly tag on 50 cents or so onto the driver's license fee to pay for voter education in the future.  I understand that you had $6 million in your budget but then removed it.  As we start to implement the new federal reform legislation it is going to be imperative that we again spend the money it takes to educate voters.  We saw what a difference it made this last cycle.  In fact, we are all still scratching our heads about the early voting.  We have all been conducting early voting for years however we haven't had the earned and paid media attention to get the word out.  After enjoying the benefits of statewide advertising to get our message out we feel very strongly that we need to secure a permanent funding source to fund voter education.

Additionally, we would like to see a move toward regional voting centers in our counties.  As we try to meet the ADA requirements in local polling locations, we are all going to find it impossible to secure adequate polling places in every precinct.  We would advocate opening regional centers and staffing them for a couple weeks prior to the election and on election day with highly skilled, trained
professional staff.  We could alleviate a lot of problems by moving towards such a system.  We have a "drive-thru" mentality among our voters and it is high time we quit trying to conduct elections the way we did in the 1800's.

I ran into Jim Magill while I was in Tallahassee last week and explained to him we were hearing very bad comments regarding the Speaker's position on the repeal of the 2nd Primary.  I hope we can count on your support.  We do not want Florida embarassed again in 2004 because some self-serving legislator wanted to push his own agenda at the risk of running our election process amuck.  This is our top, top, top priority for this session

AND IN CONCLUSION,  I will  be sworn in as President of the Supervisors Assn. in June at our meeting in Sarasota.  I know you have (or will) receive an invitation to speak to our group at that time.  The meeting is scheduled for June 1st through 5th and we would love to have you anytime that is convenient for you during that week.  And since everytime anyone in our association says "Republican" they all turn around and look at me --- it would really mean a lot for me to have you there.

Hope all is going well for you and yours and my prayers are with your brother.  This country owes so much to you and your family for the sacrifices you have made for us.

Take care,

Kay

PS  Get Jim to tell you about the federal judgeship stuff with Chester -- very interesting.

                      Dear Governor Bush,

 

I want to thank you for forwarding the information regarding the CBG MemberHealth discount prescription program to Mr. Ott in the Department of Elder Affairs. Mr. Halberg and I met with Mr. Ott, Barbara Crosier, Beth Gabrini, Mark Walsh and James Tillery on Friday. As you are aware, MemberHealth has been awarded the contract to maintain the Golden Buckeye Card in Ohio which now will include the MemberHealth Discount Prescription Plan. The Golden Buckeye Card  is similar to the proposed Senior Sand Dollar card that Mr. Ott has been working on.  Mr. Ott has not added a discount prescription plan to the Sand Dollar Card. This is a critical benefit to the seniors in the state of Florida and MemberHealth is able to alleviate unnecessary costs to the state due to its vast experience in this field.  I have taken this opportunity to list a few of the benefits available from MemberHealth, Inc. to the Seniors in Florida:

 

1. Assuming drug manufacturer support, we will mail to each Senior Sand Dollar participant,  a membership card enrolling them in the MemberHealth program.

2. MemberHealth will manage and maintain its Florida members and provide them with statewide discounts.

3. MemberHealth will identify members who currently receive assistance from the State of Florida under the Silver Saver program to ensure that each manufacturer's assistance programs are used prior to the State paying for medication.

 

I have attached two documents that Mr. Hallberg of MemberHealth, Inc. in Ohio provided.  I am in the process of providing these same documents to our state's appropriate departments.

 

Thank you for your time and support of CBG MemberHealth.

 

Sincerely,

 

Michael Mansueto

President

CBG MemberHealth, Inc

Governor Bush,

Good afternoon! I was in the middle of inputting registration forms for this
year's event, when I opened a very patriotic registration form from a
parent.  As you know we have your picture on the registration form and above
that she wrote  "Great Job Jeb!"   I thought I would pass this along to you,
hopefully brighten your day.  It did mine.

This year's event is already growing stronger than even I expected.  Today
we have over 3500 individuals entered for registration for the Family
Cafe....registration only began last Wednesday.  At this rate we will be
closed down by next week.  How explosive the need to know of the resources
and networking opportunities.  We can do so much together!

Last Friday, I met with Laura Branker.  As always, she was very helpful and
we will all miss her dedication to the disability field.  She introduced me
to the new special assistant, and I am sorry I forgot his name.  Can't wait
to work with him!  I left her with a new version of our business plan.  (I
hope that she forwarded a copy to you.)

Thank you for your continued support and dedication for families!

Smiles,

Hello Governor. Hope you had a happy birthday. 
 
So I'm ready to start talking to people about the trust funds. I've done some spread sheets and printed the budgets and source of funds for the 8 biggest agencies. I can't believe how much money is sitting in the reserve accounts of those trust funds. It's kind of amazing.  I worked in the Orange County Office of Management and Budget for about three years about 20 years ago and I really find budgets fascinating. I guess that's probably nerdy. 
 
Will I need to go through the press office to find someone from your office to talk about trust funds, or is there someone who works on the budget directly who can help me? I'd like to know how much money there is total in reserves in the trust funds that are proposed to be rolled over. I'm also wondering if there is one list somewhere with each specific trust fund proposed to be zeroed out. And I also wondered if specific changes have to be made to the statutes in order to do that?
 
 
Thanks for any help you can send my way. 
 
Dinah

Governor, 

You have indicated to me that you prefer not to be lobbied by the Board on budget issues.  In deference to your wishes, I have asked our partners to hold off sending letters similar to the attached.  I attach this letter, which was originally penned by our economic development  partners, simply to let you know that  they feel very strongly about the Team Florida marketing campaign.  This came through loud and clear to me at a regional meeting I attended last week. 

In any case, I hope that, should time allow, we might have an opportunity to discuss this matter during the Spain mission. Without lobbying you, I would like to share views and strategies should the opportunity arise.  

Thank you and I look forward to the mission you will be leading next week.

Right now, the population needs both comforting and inspiring.

Although, generally taking everything in stride, there is a modicum of  uncertainty; and a scintilla of unease, dwelling in the shadow.

Alarms, threats, direness are all prevelant...but...the 'parental support' is in need.

The situation should not be disarmed, but, confidence that, regardless of dynamics and occurrences, they will pull through as is common throughout American History.

The population needs all the truth...but ... along with the facts should accompany some praise of ability to sustain, survive, and resurge.

THAT IS NOT BE STATED.  All that is heard is the desperate, negative, dour, and tragic .....never accompanied with the Knute Rockne stimulation of , "let's win."

The elected officials have that responsibility, along with the liturgical duties of government: to provide leadership in order, and in spirit.
Regardless of physical strengths, and pecuniary abundances ... 
.......... be there a weaken morale, then be there a weaken entity.

Where are those leaders out amongst the multitude pounding encouragement, strength, and the light of tomorrow.

Where is the uplifting?  
The optimism? 
The will of surviving and revitalizing?
Where are the leading voices in a leading optimism? 

This is still America; it is not the village dump.
Folks are only viable as long as they remain viable.

Where are those visionaries of courage?
Where are those expressions ...
"We could get a real tromping,
and then we must get on with life.
This is not the first time this nation, this state, the counties, the individuals have faced adversity.....and it is not the first time of survival and resurrection."

Where is Winston and FDR?

None of that is existing... and the morale is slipping because of it.

Hip! Hip! Hooray!
 
Governor Bush, it was well worth the trip to Tallahassee today to hear such good news.  About the Choice and Control Projects being reinstated,  I really think this is the way to the future for our families of Developmentally Disabled children, and the most logical way for our families to help the State of Florida to save money.  We proved it when my son Joshua was on the" Matter of Choice Pilot Project".  Then to hear that the programs that we as parents and advocates help to develop is going to be the blueprint for the rest of the country is nothing short of astounding and very gratifying for all the hard work we and you put in.  
It was to bad we didn't get to talk today but we did see each other in passing,  That was my wife and I that was sitting over in the corner near the Rotunda on the Plaza Level that waved at you and you waved back as you were coming through from the Representive's side of the building with several other people.
It was a pleasure though to meat Lt. Governor Brogan before he leaves office (and by the way he is a pretty snappy dresser).
I would be glad to help out an any way to move the state in this direction, and please tell Shelly Brantley I'm behind her all the way, and she has my full support when ever she needs it.  If any assistance is needed to help this get off the ground please don't hesitate to call me or e-mail me any time, being retired at an early age doesn't give me a lot to do and I am usually home during the day (850 - 682 - 1756) (I am the same age as you, 50).  This is definitely the shot in the arm our DD program needed.  Again thank you and Shelly for inviting me and my wife, to hear this wonderful news...............Your friend always, Darrell Walker
 
p.s.  Happy 50th. belated Birthday :-)

Dear Governor Bush: 
    I know you have heard from many others but I urge you to reconsider your decision to shut down the state library and museum complex. Florida desperately needs a better sense of its identity. That became clear to me when I first came to this state in 1983 and it remains true. The complexity of our past can bring us together.  We need to see, hear and touch the experiences of the people who have lived here. We need to build on our past and not ignore it. It sounds like history is taking a hit because its a relatively easy victim with a minimal constituency. 
    Please do not break up our history and disperse it to the winds.

From: Steve Rothschild

Dear Ms. Torres, you write my response to your request is too long and general. Can you understand this?

(Ms. Torres you wrote) "...I am still not sure what is the activity you refer to in your business plan. Can you tell me in a couple of sentences? I understand you are looking for a business contact in Israel. Who would be a good match for your business plan?..."


QUESTION NUMBER ONE. "...what is the activity you refer to in your business plan. Can you tell me in a couple of sentences? "

..ANSWER TO QUESTION NUMBER ONE.
 
....SENTENCE 1: Yes.

Consult and advise individuals, companies, entities and governments and to raise and invest funds into for-profit* and not-for-profit ventures that benefit world humanitarian and ethical issues involving health, the economy, jobs and the sanctity of the workplace, all subject to and in conformity with applicable law and good ethics....(* for-profit being often SBA 8(a), veterans, women, minority small  and medium size businesses,) in fields including without limitation, Communications, and legal and financial services,and of course, as customary there are no guarantees.


....SENTENCE NUMBER TWO 2..subject to sufficient approvals and funding...the provision of an integrated approach that would bring together the capabilities of information technology, organizational management, marketing and capital investment to develop or provide a system that could be used to (1) provide proof-of-concepts(s) for any or all of the Communications Clearinghouse components: the Confidential computer-based Patient Record (including the Biowar Early Warning System module), the Media Communications Company, and/or the Monetary Communications Company, (2) demonstrate their utility and cost effectiveness, and (3) implement them, making them available, globally. 


QUESTION NUMBER TWO. 

"Who would be a good match for your business plan?..."
(HERE IN ISRAEL)

ANSWER TO QUESTION NUMBER TWO.
             
AT THE GOVERNMENT LEVEL - THE STATE OF ISRAEL..THE PM
...(IMPLEMENTATION POSSIBLY)......ALOUF PIKUD HAORIF

      
AT THE PRIVATE LEVEL:

........THIS ANSWER IS IN PROCESS AND WILL BE FORTH COMING.


Ms. Torres can you understand this? If not, please ask the Ambassador to help me understand what you do not see? The response is as you requested, in answer to 2 questions you required with the 1st requiring an answer in 2 sentences. There are approximately 81 words in the 1st sentence. The US Income Tax Code has 277 words in 1 sentence, so the amount of words can not be a problem as the US Government requires every US Citizen to be able to understand a sentence with 277 words in it. The 2nd sentence has approximately 83 words. This sentence parallels the sentence in a reference letter from Dr. Henry Krakauer the US Government Specialist for Epediemology in the Secretary's Office of the Department of Health and Human Services of the United States of America.

The above is to your question number 1. Your question number 2 is answered in approximately 10 words. 

This is your format.

What is it you do not see and is it possible the Ambassador will understand it?



Very respectfully,



Stephen A. L. Rothschild

URGENT

E-mail  Delivery

February 3, 2003


US Department of Commerce associated with the United States Embassy in
Israel
Ms. Yael Torres
ytorres@mail.doc.gov
Tel in Israel: 03-519-7611

Dear Ms. Torres:

This is an alternate e-mail from the rothschildbanc@lycos.com, referenced,
below, which is filling up on capacity.

It was very nice meeting you by telephone, today. It is as the result of speaking with the US Ambassador's assistant who referred me to Ms. Hammond who referred me to the Commerce Deparment which resulted in our speaking by telephone. This is the e-mail we discussed.

As mentioned, I am urgently and respectfully re-proposing and requesting by this writing a Consulting Agreement with the United States as a Client at
the earliest possible date concerning (1) A Biowar Interned Inteactive Early Warning System as described herein and, including without limitation (2) Think Tank services. In this connection, my company has been awarded as set out on the followig web site: http://www.sba8a.com/yr04/fl102197.htm, an SBA 8(a) participation,  and a US Government and Commercial Entity Number of 053J5.

Of course there are many sole source methods available for the Contract in addition to the SBA 8(a) which are all sufficient in and of themselves, but it is a plausible addition. The proposed Consulting Agreement, from a not-for-profit, non partison and non-political division of the Company set out here is for Think Tank services for the US and where appropriate, ISRAEL, and others agreeable to them are in the "third wave of think tank" traditions as set out by Richard Haass, Director of Policy and Planning of the U.S. Department of State, in his recent article entitled "THINK TANKS
AND U.S. FOREIGN POLICY: A POLICY-MAKERS PERSPECTIVE with the capabilities of the Company set out in the Company web site at: http;//'stephenalrothschild.tripod.com. The Company's advocasy, controversy resolution, economic, advisory, research and development capabilities along with its other capabilities in information systems development, social and environmental infrastructure development, advanced research and technology development acquisition and as listed on the respective web sites are all present there as well as in the references
and referals at http://angelfire.com/super/aim. The Company's issue focus is set out in the references web sites in both the domestic and foreign policy areas.

The Company's primay proposal for Consulting Agreement from its for-profit area hereby re-proposed is for the following services regarding The Biowar Interactive Early Warning and Security Defense System (the "System") which was submitted in 1997 during the prior Administration was to be appropriately and properly implemented and to make America ready with a
>secure homeland defense, then, and it has not been implemented or presented to the President, yet, but rather misappropriated and set-on an improper
track. It may be too late to perform its appropriate and proper implementation before the next Biowar attack, if we do not act, now. As the proposed System protected individual privacy, as well, its delay has caused the Bush administration and the American public terribly severe and unnecessary headaches, worry and disunity at a time when America and America's president deserve responses and solutions building for unity and security. In all humility and modesty it is time to stand up to the job of putting in the right defense for America and her allies. The Biowar
Interactive Warning System as proposed is believed far
faster (over 200% plus) and more pervasive than the new Bioterror Monitor technique announced, last week. Knowing, of course, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, there can be no guarantees, the Biowar Early
>Warning System as proposed, before and now, here, appropriately and properly implemented, would, in all humility and modesty (1) provide you and the President, the Commerce Department, the Terrorist Threat Integration Center and the President's Counterproliferation Technology Coordination Committee, and American and her Allies, with the necessary, but missing and critically vital earliest real-time instrumentation revealing subtle suspicious vital life sign deviations among vast populations (2) while protecting and enhancing the privacy rights of the people, (3) and enabling the greatest in-time response for the most effective deterrence and mitigation protecting Americans and America's
allies. But, the Biowar Early Warning and Defense System is still delayed since March 31st, 1997, by the prior administration, while America is facing its
greatest terrorists risks. It was on or about that date I submitted a Proposal for the System to DARPA and others in the prior Administration by which I provided The Biowar Interactive Early Warning System White Paper forecasting the likelihood of sneak anthrax and other sneak biowar attacks against Americans and America's allies' and their populations. The Biowar Early Warning System was proposed for implementation in 1997 as the only suitable instrument to begin protecting Americans and America's allies
>against the unwarranted risks perceived to exist at that time and shown to have been, unfortunately, all too correct. This is a re-proposal, delayed by disruptive circumstances (1) respectfully and urgently requesting an Initial Consulting Agreement for an even improved Biowar Interactive Early Warning System, recommended by Dr. Nancy Miller, (former) United States Air Force Acquisition and Program Manager, set out below, together with John F. McCarthy, Jr, attorney, a key partner in America's and the world's largest labor law firm practicing exclusively in America, (2) including a One Page Summary, attached. The part of the balance of this letter describes the
current situation, in which almost five (5) years after submission, finally, by letter Dated January 4, 2002, Dr. Anna Johnson-Winegar, Ph.D., with whom I first had contact at Chemical/Biological Defense in 1999, thanks me for..."...(your)...support of the DoDChemical and biological Defense Program and for the welfare of U. S. Military forces.." as I had been continuing attempts during the prior administration to gain implementation of the Biowar Early Warning System
>before American lives and resources which would be saved, were tragically lost. Dr. Anna Johnson-Winegar's response  was most revealingly and perhaps
with all due respect to her, courageous, as regarding one of the several continued submission's during the Clinton administration and well before the September 11, 2001 attacks. She disclosed that the Department had been only involved in a process for "..identifying outbreaks of non-battle related illnesses for the deployed soldiers...(and)...also working closely
with civilian public health services as they develop methodologies.." but nothing more and nothing had
>been mentioned to have been conceived or implemented for the comprehensive Biowar Early Warning and Defense System implementation proposed by me as an integrative contractor to provide the American population and those of America's allies with the comprehensive deterrence and mitigation protection offered by the System which was offered during the prior Administration in 1997. Now, once the tragedy of September 11, 2001, and the time related anthrax deaths occurred, Dr. Anna Johnson-Winegar is
quoted as saying "shame on us" for not acting earlier. Indeed. 

So they have announced they will do something, now, after receiving repeated proposals to provide the System and after September 11, 2001, occurred, by using the trade secreted ideas/concepts without consent of the proponent and by spending $300,000,000 on it, but, they are admitting they do not have a model, only the ideas I tradesecreted and submitted.
Moreover, they admittedly do not know how to implement it and, as a consequence they are running late, on the wrong path, and causing the Bush administration and America great unnecessary problems and greater risks.
>Let American's admit we can no longer be tied to the prior administration's continuing inaction and methods of denial resulting in no defense or a sham defense from which the Bush Administration will have to
dig out. If given a real chance, I will go forward as the owner of the intellectual property and the author of and one who presented it trade secreted, with a good tradesecreted model to provide the Bush

As the school health coordinator for our county health department I would like you to know that VisionQuest has given invaluable services to many students that have no health insurance to cover vision referrals and glasses. They have been extremely prompt in response to our needs, coordinated services with local providers and followup with monthly reports as to the status of the referred students. Although other groups, such as the Lion's Club, have been helpful with providing glasses, if needed, they do not cover the cost of a physician's appointments for refraction. Please consider this need when determining budget considerations since the majority of our population does not have health insurance that covers yearly eye exams and the cost of glasses.

Poor vision not only effects our activities of daily living but also a student's reading ability and school performance in general.

Thank you for your consideration.

ENmiendAS para debilitar el embargo contra la tirania cubana fueron eliminAdas de la ley dE presupuesto

 

Washington, DC – El Congresista Lincoln Diaz-Balart (R-FL) anunció hoy, después de que el Comité de Reglamento de la Cámara aprobó la Ley de Presupuesto (“Omnibus”) de 2003, de $397 mil millones de dólares,  poco después de las 7:00 de la mañana, que todas las enmiendas para debilitar las sanciones contra la tiranía cubana han sido eliminadas del proyecto de ley. 

 

“Nuestra formula para el triunfo puede ser descrita en dos palabras: George Bush,” dijo Diaz-Balart. El Presidente Bush reiteradas veces amenazó con vetar la Ley de Presupuesto si incluía cualquier debilitamiento del embargo contra la tiranía cubana

 

“También le estamos extremadamente agradecidos, nuevamente, al Liderazgo Republicano de la Cámara por su inquebrantable apoyo a la causa de la libertad de Cuba,” continuó Diaz-Balart.

 

En julio del año pasado, varias enmiendas fueron añadidas al proyecto de ley del presupuesto del Departamento del Tesoro y del Correo en el pleno de la Cámara de Representantes. El Senado, mas tarde, le añadió lenguaje al proyecto de ley que hubiese debilitado la prohibición al turismo de Estados Unidos a la Cuba totalitaria. Todas las medidas para debilitar el embargo fueron eliminadas de la Ley de Presupuesto (“Omnibus Appropriations”) antes de que el proyecto de ley fuera aprobado por el Comité de Reglamento de la Cámara poco después de las 7:00 de la mañana en el día de hoy. Dicha legislación ahora será considerada por el pleno de la Cámara en el día de hoy y después de su aprobación por el Senado será enviada a la Casa Blanca para la firma del Presidente.

 

“El apoyo del Presidente George W. Bush a la causa de la libertad de Cuba es extraordinario. Le estamos profundamente agradecidos al Presidente por su solidaridad, su amistad y su liderazgo sin paralelo,” dijo Diaz-Balart.

Subject:	Jeppesen VisionQuest Funding

Dear Governor Bush,
I have just heard some very stressful news that there is a possibility that
funding may be cut for Jeppesen VisionQuest. This organization provides free
eye exams and glasses for students in our county. I am afraid children in
our area will lose a great service if this program no longer exist.
We have 41% of our student population in the free and reduced lunch program
and many of them do not qualify for Medicaid and others are noted to be on
the list for Kid Care and do not have the financial means to have an eye
exam or obtain glasses if  needed. Even children with Medicaid have a
difficult time finding a practioner that will accept this coverage. Many of
our children are from one parent homes and health services are usually
placed on the back burner in favor of buying food instead of taking care of
health care needs. 
Over three hundred children (from our last data report) have received
glasses from Jeppersen Vision Quest this year alone. There are cases that
show children's academic performance has improved since receiving glasses.
You are a respected governor for your desire to have all children able to
read and do well on your FCAT testing but I am afraid we both will fail the
children if they are denied this service due to funding cuts. 
In one case in our county a student was noted for straight A and B reports
from school began to experience lower grades and the teacher requested a
nurse screen the child. The nurse found the child had 20/200 vision in both
eyes. His glasses were broken and the parent was trying to save money for a
new pair that cost over $300.00. The nurse refered the child to Jeppesen
Vision Quest and he was provided an eye exam and glasses. It had been two
years since he had been examined due to the parent financial situation so an
eye exam was in order.  You will never feel or understand the emotion felt
by the  nurse that had the resources to help this child with his desire to
succeed. The stress we feel when we discover a child that needs services and
we do not have resources for them is very painful. Before Jeppersen Vision
Quest I felt the pain and saw the despair on the faces of parents that did
not have money to care for their child's vision/health needs. 
I am requesting  you support funding for this much needed serrvice for Lake
County and your efforts will be greatly appreciated
.

Dear Governor Bush:

During the summer months, I am employed by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation
Commission as an Aquatic Instructor. I am responsible for heading up the Children's
Fishing Education Program. This program is part of the Urban Pond Project. Each
year we conduct fishing clinics around the Jacksonville area. During these clinics
we teach the children about the environment, different species of fish, the
food chain, safety and the proper way to use fishing equipment.
This summer will be my seventh year with the FWC. In six years myself and another
instructor have taught close to 20,000 children. Making our project in Jacksonville
number one. Just last year alone, we set a single summer record of teaching
over 5,000 children. Many of the children we see have never been fishing before.
Many would never have been exposed to the great sport of fishing if this program
were not available. So many of the children and adults we see tell us that the
fishing clinics is their favorite thing to do all summer.
Seeing a child catch their first fish makes this job very rewarding. We need
your help and support. Allow us to continue to pass on the great sport of fishing
to many more children of our great state. Please support and protect the Urban
Pond Projects. Thank You.

Governor Bush and Senator Pruitt,

I am the Health Technician at Oriole Beach Elementary in Gulf Breeze,
Florida. I recently heard that their was a possibility that there would be
no funds to continue Jeppensen Vision Quest. We have so many children in
Santa Rosa and Escambia County that would not get vision screenings much
less glasses if it wasn't for this program. 


I remember when I was in fourth grade and received glasses for the first
time. I had no idea what I had been missing. I never knew till I put on
those glasses that the leaves on the trees in the Fall had so many colors.
Before, they sort of blurred together into one big blob.  I remember looking
out of the car window as my mom drove to the store. I couldn't believe the
colors and shapes I could see at a distance with my new glasses on. Before
without them, the distance looked like a blurry fog of colors. No more did I
have to squint to see. I didn't have to sit in the front in class any
longer, because now I could see the chalk board at a distance.

I am so thankful that God gave someone the knowledge and education to invent
glasses to help those that can not see well. Please don't take this gift
away from our children, for their sight will mold our  future. 

Sincerely,
Lisa Adams

John, It is good to hear from you, and yes we did know in our hearts that 
you and the family would most likely be in over the head with computer 
repairs. It is most gratifying to know that our parts shipment was of good 
use to you. We have more CD-ROM drives, floppy drives, video cards, mice and 
few other items that we could send. We are out of hard drives and are in 
need of another load of used computers. The job situation and economy here 
is not that good-we may have to make a change. However I would like to help 
and send another parts shipment. Finding duel voltage monitors (or 240vac) 
here is like impossible. So you may have to continue with shipments from 
neighbor islands.

We are sorry to hear about the trouble and the loss of lives. We need Jesus 
more than ever these days. It seems that the whole world is being shaken, a 
time of decision. Will we take the right path, or run toward destruction. It 
is written, “ do not be overly righteous, why destroy yourself before your 
time?” But mankind refuses to see the simple light of truth. We all need 
each other; there is a divine plan, if we would just treat others with 
respect.

Christmas and New years was kind of unusual over here too, difficult family 
time, job, holidays, our friend Calvin retired. We had coldest weather on 
record (for this area) on one, or two days this year. My sister in North 
Carolina was with out power for one and a half weeks. They could not go to 
work because the snow blocked the roads for days.

We will continue to ask God to help you with the good work that you are 
providing to the schools. Wish I could have been there to help you during 
the holidays. I will copy this e-mail to Howard and also to Tami with 
Project Hope of Tallahassee. The local newspaper did not bite the hook when 
I went fishing for a story about us and Project Hope. I had high Hopes that 
a good story would get us some donations on used parts that we could send to 
you. The problem- I was trying for one big fish at the Local Paper and 
should have instead tried to see if anyone would bite. I think the story 
might have helped them make a few sales. Oh well maybe next year.

Keep the Faith and God Bless!

Mike

Those students were tested and those that failed their tests were given the opportunity to receive free glasses.  There were numerous students who had vision deficits revealed through these tests.  One student has even been recommended for eye surgery for cataracts.
     Two students in my class received their glasses on February 7.  One of these students was a behavior problem however, since receiving his glasses he has become a totally different person.  He has told me that school seems to be a lot easier and he doesn't want to fight anymore because he may break his glasses.
     Please understand that the JeppenseVisionQuest program has saved numerous kids with both learning impediments and behavior problems at our school.  I urge you not to make any cuts to this program.  If we're in the business of saving our future, why not start with their vision.  Perhaps for some, it will be the light that need to be turned on.

Thank You Kindly For Your Time,

Subject:	Children's Programs

Dear Governor Bush,
Please do not allow essential children's programs to be cut.
Jeppesen VisionQuest is a crucial program. Children who
cannot see, cannot read.
These are the programs which help children stay off the streets
and away from drugs.
Please support children becoming successful in their lives.
People who care about this state's future...the children...have
no problem with increased taxes to support these programs
to ensure our youth's physical and mental health. But that is the 
way, isn't it? People with modest means are the biggest donors
in this country.
Perhaps the very wealthy could stand fewer exemptions thereby 
taking some of the pressure off of those less fortunate. 
Thank you,

I have been reading your letters to newspapers and to the Governor concerning the incarcerated. I just wanted to thank you for voicing your concerns and attempting to promote change. There are far too few educated, productive members of society (especially in FL),who will take a stand for such an unpopular cause. You give people like me hope, and courage to try and make a difference for not just my own family but the tens of thousands of family members who are dealing with this broken system in Florida. Thank you again and God bless.

Dear Governor Bush:

It is with much anger that I read your plans for our state library. HOW DARE YOU, A NON-NATIVE FLORIDIAN, presume to lay a finger on my heritage?! How can you possibly justify boxing up and shipping away some portions of this collections to the likes of dusty basements and/or scattered collections. SHAME ON YOU!!!  Your privatization and cost cutting ideas have gone too far. It would seem that your squeezing out more money and selling valued state services, such as state parks to private and ignorant corporations have hit a new low. Silver Glen and Alexander Springs now have staff that don't know squat about springs or the native wildlife( I know, I asked them!). Now you want to target irreplaceable institutions such as our one and only state library? This is the act of one who either has no respect for native Floridians and their history, and/or one who has no appreciation for the intellectual and artistic things that money simply cannot buy. Shame on you, Jeb Bush!!!
If you want to take apart a library, do it in TEXAS.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
Thank you so much for supporting this important environmental purchase in St. John's county---8,465 acres added to the corridor that links existing preserves is no small thing!  The benefits to our collective future of such wise acquisitions cannot be measured, and you deserve credit for championing it.
 
I am also highly supportive of your Wekiwa task force's recommendations for preserving that surrounding area from detrimental development, as our very WATER source is at stake.  I sincerely hope the state can override any preemptive attempt by the Apopka City Council to annex that land (designated by your task force as environmentally critical to protecting the Wekiwa basin) against the welfare of all Floridians.
 
Thank you for your continued vigilance---and that of your cabinet members---in your judicious stewardship of our dwindling natural resources.  The St. Johns county purchase is marvelous!  BRAVO!  (Happy Valentines' Day!)

Jeb, I want to run an idea by you.  I am sure that you are asked to visit a pile of different groups when you come down to SW Florida and you just can't get to every one of them even if you wanted to do so.  Here is my idea.  United Christian Giving helped 26 different groups in 2001 and now it looks like we will be giving UCG Challenge Grants to about 46 different groups from our 2002 campaign.  We are looking at having the first ever auction where 46 different SW Florida goups will benefit.  Many of the 46 groups have their own auctions but our idea is to let them have their individual auctions but to have an Annual UCG Auction that would be the kick off of the UCG Annual Challenge Grant Campaign where 100% of the money raised would benefit those groups.  My idea where you come in is that your attendance would make a huge impact on the success of the auction and just think your attendance would impact 46 different groups.  I just want your personal opinion of if you would like to attend IF it benefited 46 different groups.  Please dont give it to your scheduling folks because I either ask too early or I ask too late, I never seem to get a yes out of them.  I am hoping that impacting 46 groups might make a difference to you personally and that you might simply make it happen.  It would be a first class auction and I would supply you with all the info you wanted so that you would know what you were getting yourself into.  Your side would simply be to be there and to say a few short words about grass root organizations volunteering in Florida. What da ya think Jeb?  Thanks, frank  PS if you did not feel comfortable with an auction venue we could just make it a luncheon or dinner where it would just be a regular fund raiser that would benefit all 46 groups.

year career, I am now earning an annual salary of $33,000.  After taxes, I realized

an $81 a month pay increase this year.  My State Farm Insurance on my house

caused my house payment to go up $42 a month and my share of expenses for my

I did 
not receive a pay raise as my raise is not keeping up with increased expenses.


Is there any hope in the near future for Florida teachers receiving a "real"

Subject: Can you assist me in helping others?


Dear Governor Bush,
 
  Polk County schoolteacher, here!
 
  Thanks for your quick response to my E-mail about Florida recognizing March as Colorectal Cancer Awareness month. Your aide Brandi has E-mailed me saying she will send me the proclamation when it comes out.
 
  I want to do more than that! I will contact the Lakeland Ledger and talk about my wife's and my experiences with colon cancer. I will also go to area churches to get the word out that this disease is very treatable (when discovered early). Unfortunately, my wife had no warning signs and when she was diagnosed it was in Stage 3 of progression. I miss her so much! 
 
  I hope to make people aware that it is detectable by getting a colonoscopy, as a periodic checkup. My wife and I , unfortunately, were not aware of the disease, and were unable to effectively treat the cancer early enough.
 
  I would also like to talk to our leglislators (House and Senate) to share my wife's story and to alert them of the possibilities of screening for this #2 cancer killer. Please let me know if the opportunity could be somehow arranged.
I believe the only way that I can keep my sanity of not having my lovely wife here on Earth, is to do something beneficial (to others), and to honor her.
She was such a brave and courageous fighter and such a wonderful Christian example to others, right up until the end. I have to do this for her and others. (Meaning the sons,daughters, Moms, Dads, brothers and sisters & friends that might avoid losing their loved one by being screened and preventing their early and unfortunate demise to this disease.)
 
   I have a friend in Iowa that is the volunteer head of the Colon Cancer Awareness  Organization that needs an encouraging word from Iowa's governor,
Tom Vilsack. She is speaking at the Colon Cancer Awareness National Convention in Washington ,D.C. in April. She is also on the agenda to talk to lobbyists in Washington, to get the message across; however, she needs all the help she can get from her governor, Mr. Vilsack.
Her name is Natalie Porter (she lost her Dad, at the age of 50, to colon cancer, 2 years ago). I don't have her address yet, but I do have her E-mail address and phone number. Maybe you could spur on her governor to assist her in Iowa's cause. I think it just takes an awareness and maybe a change in attitude to get people's attention. I just know the blessings people can have by getting early detection!
 
   If it sounds like I'm fired up, you're correct! I must preserve my wife's memory (and my mental well-being) by helping others get educated , enrolled, and behind this awareness!
 
   Sorry if I went on too long!
 
  I am so proud that you, and your brother, are offering guidance and leadership to  Florida and our great country, in this difficult time in history. God bless you both! May He give you wisdom and discernment in the many decisions that you both will need to make.
 
    Have a productive day! Thanks for "listening" and thinking about "my cause".

Subject:	CPR for all

My wife and I received your letter date Feb 11th in ref: to our request to 
require CPR for all pool owners.  First it is our intention to move this 
process to the state level.  The safety fence ordinance you mention is now a 
state law, and goes well beyond what was defeated in Clearwater.  We have 
confirmation that the county can pass an Ordinance, on what we asked for.  
How many children must die before we take that step?  More people drown each 
year than are hurt by fireworks, yet we choose to move forward with that.  
The fire departments are not teaching the course for free, they are charging. 
 In addition it is never, ever advised to learn CPR by listening to someone 
trying to tell you how to perform it over the phone. in fact you are never to 
perform CPR without being certified.  It is time to stand up and lets save 
more kids lives.  If you wish I will bring before you the many parents that 
lost a child or a loved one to drowning.  In a small child the first 4 mins. 
means life or death,  We must step up and move forward.  If we can stop the 
use of fireworks then lets stop the useless drowning.  There is no one that 
can tell me today that there is an argument for the cost or feasibility of 
such a requirement.  Have we the right to place a price on a loved ones life? 
 We must look to the tremendous cost that it places on our system an average 
of $750.00 a day to care for a near drowning victim.  And the grief of a lost 
loved one.  Please think about what we do when we say we will not force you 
to take CPR but we will limit your use of sparklers.

I stopped by Senator Wasserman-Schultz's office today and talked to her aide about this bill, SB 1022.  She indicated that the Senator filed this bill at the request of a House member and that the House version has not surfaced yet.  It sounded as thought the Senator did not have any "agenda" in filing this bill as far as how much fees would be increased.  I also went to the House to investigate who or what is behind the proposal, but was unable to find the potential House sponsor, Rep. Gottlieb.  I will try to find out more information tomorrow.
 
As an aside, this is likely one of many, many bills to be filed which are designed to raise local fees in response to the Article V Constitutional amendment now requiring the state to pay for the court system in the various counties.

Dear Governor Bush:

Two things, gas prices. Help! Please!  We are all poor enough here without price gouging.  I can't believe that all of a sudden the price went up from the source and then goes up to the consumer in the way it has.  Before long it will be food or gas.  

My own next door neighbors are using kerosene heat instead of the electric central heat and are using candles at night.  No tv, no heat.  This is not an impoverished neighborhood either.  But it sure looks like it's going to get that way soon. I stopped at a garage sale and found another kerosene heater, like the one next door for sale.  I was tempted to make that purchase.

We need help here.  Please

Second PACE for teenaged girls.  I understand this program is being cut statewide.  I need to ask you to think about this first.  This program builds the self esteem of the future mothers of our state.  If you are truely trying to promote marriage and get women and their small children off welfare for the betterment of this state, than why would you cut a program that is the grassroots of your program?  

I wish this program were in place when my daughter was having her problems. I most definitely would have placed her there.  From the stats., that were in my newspaper this morning they have a great recovery rate for young women.  

Please reconsider and get some funding for the PACE program.  

Most respectfully yours,

St. Augustine couple praised by governor 

From Staff 

A St. Augustine couple married 63 years were among five couples honored
by Governor Jeb Bush and First Lady Columba Bush Thursday.

Granvil and Geraldine "Jerry" Anderson joined the Bushes and four other
couples for a private dinner at the Governor's Mansion in Tallahassee.
The Andersons were married on April 18, 1939 and credit their successful
marriage to cooperation and teamwork.

"These married couples are an incredible source of inspiration and
wisdom to all of us," said Bush. "Their personal experiences, each
spanning 50 years or more, provide living examples of how to strengthen
our families and live a more fulfilling life."

By honoring these five couples, whose time-tested marriages have been
built on solid foundations, Bush is encouraging Floridians to make an
effort to spend more time with their families, read to a child,
volunteer at a neighborhood school, or visit with an elderly neighbor.

The Florida Association of Seniors Centers selected the five couples
from around the state who participate at local senior centers.

Cathy Brown, executive director of the St. Johns County Council on
Aging, is president of the senior centers association. She said the
organization asked its 170 centers to submit nominations. In St. Johns
County, the council received 20 nominations.

"We are thrilled that the governor is highlighting families and the
folks that come to the senior center are those kind of people who have
led productive lives and are the backbone of our community," Brown
said.

Also honored:


Arnold and Phyllis Blacker, of Deerfield Beach, married for 55 years
(May 21, 1947).

Edelmino "Eddie" and Madeleine Gimenez of Mexico Beach, married for 52
years (Nov. 24, 1950).

Dr. Devurn and Allie Glenn of Tallahassee, married for 59 years (Nov.
12, 1943).

Robert "Bob" and Billie Milner of Tallahassee, married for 55 years
(June 7, 1947).

The Middle Eastern countries are boycotting American goods. We should 
return the favor. An interesting thought is to boycott their GAS. Every 
time you fill up the car, you can avoid putting more money into their 
coffers. Just buy from gas companies that don't import their oil.
Nothing is more frustrating than the feeling that every time I fill-up the 
tank, I am sending my money to people who are trying to kill me, my family, 
and my friends. I thought it might be interesting for you to know which oil 
companies are the best to buy gas from and which major companies import 
Middle Eastern oil (for the period 9/1/00 - 8/31/01):
Shell................. 205,742,000 barrels
Chevron/Texaco....... 144,332,000 barrels
Exxon /Mobil............. 130,082,000 barrels
Marathon/Speedway.. 117,740,000 barrels
Amoco................ 62,231,000 barrels

If you do the math at $30/barrel, these imports amount to over $18 BILLION!
Here are some large companies that DO NOT import Middle Eastern oil:
Citgo................... 0 barrels
Sunoco............. 0 barrels
Conoco............. 0 barrels
Sinclair............... 0 barrels
BP/Phillips.......... 0 barrels
Hess................... 0 barrels

All of this information is available from the U.S. Department of Energy and 
each is required to state where they get their oil and how much they are 
importing.
They report on a monthly basis. Keep this list in your car; share it with 
friends. Stop paying for terrorism.............
To have an impact, we need to reach literally millions of gas buyers.

As I'm sure you are aware that Florida has the most disabled Veterans in the Nation, yes, Texas has the most Veterans with 4 VA Regional Claims Offices that sits around with NO work to do, however, by far, Florida has the most disabled Vets and has only one VA regional Claims Office with years of back logs in looking at claims and I also might add it is KNOWN AS THE NATIONS WORSE CLAIMS OFFICE IN HELPING VETERANS, this is a disgrace to our Florida Veterans that gave so much and now get so little to nothing, help me in my fight in solving this very unjust situation.
 
I travel all over the State of Florida giving presentations at my own cost from my own retirement trying to help our Florida Veterans and I assure you that I praise our Governor Jeb Bush for all his understanding and his help in trying to help the Florida Veterans, he is the Veterans friend, however, we must do something better than it is at present, the VA is not our friend and does very shoddy work in St. Petersburg.

Dear Governor Bush, 
 
I received an email from Nancy Jeppesen urging me to help save the vision program, Jeppesen VisionQuest, that helps over 15,000 children receive free vision exams and eyeglasses annually. As a mother and a healthcare worker I am very aware of the costs of medical and health care.  I also have two sisters who have Retinitus Pigmentosa, a disease that causes gradual vision loss leading to blindness, who have had this disease since they were small children.  They have always needed glasses or contacts.  The Blind Services now helps them with visual aids or seeing eye dogs, whatever they need.  I thank the heavens everyday that there is help for them.  There is no cure for RP.  If you discontinue the Jeppesen VisionQuest Program children whose parents can not afford vision services will not get diagnosed properly.  Some will suffer tremendously.  Please do not let that happen.  Everyone deserves a chance to see.
 
Sincerely,

Dear Jeb,
I know that the Governor has lots on his mind these days, but I wanted to weigh in on the side of trying to give you some support to get more dollars for education....particularly community colleges.  

During the past few weeks, I have been part of the presidents group that has been testifying before the House and the Senate.  I feel like we are building some traction for community colleges and some understanding of the unfunded growth issue that we face.  That may be a "first" for us!

In discussion with Patricia Leveque this week, she was very impassioned when she spoke about your commitment to community colleges and how you have struggled with the budget.  I want you to know that I know that you are an incredible champion for community colleges.  I know that it is a tough year ? and will probably get tougher ? however, I would be remiss if I didn't press forward for more funding for Seminole, which is educating 47% more students than 5 years ago with an FTE allocation that is 33% lower given our growth.

So, keep the faith and we will tackle this together.  ann

Jeb-Last year, I mentioned that, my wife Pam, and I would be attending the ERA Real Estate International Business Conference, in San Diego, March 14 and 15, 2003.  Your Mom and Dad are going to be our keynote speakers, at our General Session, either the 14th or the 15th.  I would appreciate it, if at all possible, if Pam and I could have the opportunity to meet them either before, after, or any time at their convenience, at the Conference.  We would like to personally thank them for all they have done, and for providing us with people like you and your brother.  People of integrity, strong moral character, and leaders who are unashamed to demonstrate spiritual and organizational leadership.

Governor: Please note how the EPA says the site is now clean.  Well,
residences abut right up against this site and there has not been a
comprehensive soil testing done. The dioxin did not rain down solely on the
Wingate landfill.  Dioxin spewed out in a 1 to 2 mile jurisdiction. There
has been no health study ever performed in the Wingate community. No one can
say that dioxin is not killing these babies, in utero and out of utero, and
families which include moms, dads, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles and
elderly people, etc. etc. 

Infant mortality studies going back to 1992 show that these Wingate zip
codes included infant deaths 3 times the rate in the rest of the county.
Even in other black areas in the county.  

Thanks for listening.

Program to study high death rate among black newborns 
--------------------

By Nancy McVicar
Health Writer

February 14, 2003

Black babies are dying in Broward County at a rate almost three times that
of white babies, and often the bereaved parents are left to wonder why.
"They don't autopsy babies unless there was some kind of foul play. Families
can't afford it, and insurance doesn't pay for it," said Priscilla Hawk, a
volunteer with the League of Women Voters.
Hawk is among a group of county residents who have worked for almost a
decade to get answers to the widening disparity in mortality between white
babies and black babies. Their efforts have made a difference.
Last week, the Broward County Commission authorized $200,000 to establish a
pediatric pathology program in cooperation with the North Broward Hospital
District.
The program will be explained to the community in a forum from 10 a.m. to
noon Saturday at the African-American Research Library & Cultural Center,
2650 Sistrunk Blvd. in Fort Lauderdale.
Parents, black or white, who want to find out why their baby died will be
able to have an autopsy performed free of charge. Results will be put into a
registry and used to look for patterns with the hope of preventing such
deaths in the future, Hawk said.

Panelists at Saturday's meeting will include Dr. Peter Johnson, chief of
pathology and laboratory services for the hospital district; Dr. Joshua
Perper, Broward County medical examiner, and Aletha Pillon-Fink, manager of
the county's Fetal/Infant Mortality Review, a part of the Healthy
Mothers/Healthy Babies Coalition.
The recorded infant death rate for black babies in 2001, the most recent
year for which statistics have been completed, was 9.5 per 1,000 live births
in Broward, compared with 4.1 deaths per 1,000 births for white babies,
according to the Florida Department of Health Office of Vital Statistics.
The average of the death rates for two ZIP codes in central Broward, 33311
and 33313, was even higher, according to statistics gathered by Pillon-Fink,
leading families and health care workers to wonder whether the deaths are
related to biological, environmental or other causes, such as undiagnosed
infections among the mothers or lack of prenatal care.
"Those two ZIP codes are predominantly black. I can't tell you why the
disparity exists," Pillon-Fink said. "It could be due to lack of prenatal
care or too little prenatal care, other societal factors, poor nutrition-it
could be several things."
Some residents of that area suspect the Wingate incinerator and landfill,
once loaded with toxic waste, may be to blame for some of the deaths, even
though the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says the site is now clean.
"For the people who think it's Wingate, [the pediatric pathology program]
may actually give some answers one way or the other," Pillon-Fink said.
Of the 314 infant or fetal deaths in the county registered in 2001, only 31
were followed by an autopsy.
Pillon-Fink, who lost a daughter 41 weeks into her pregnancy five years ago,
said she knows some parents won't consider an autopsy because they are too
upset and grieving for the child they just lost. She and her husband were
offered an autopsy and decided against it.
"But I think there are going to be families out there who are going to want
it, and we can at least offer it to them, and it will give them some peace
of mind for the next pregnancy," Pillon-Fink said.
Hawk said she knows women who have decided not to have more children because
they had a baby that died and they don't know why.
"I've heard some who say 'I wish I knew why my baby died.' For some it's
just hanging there forever, because they just don't know what happened,"
Hawk said.
Commissioner Lori Parrish, who lost her 10-month-old granddaughter Courtney
to spinal musculature atrophy, a congenital disease, was instrumental in
getting the commission to approve the program.
"I don't want other moms and grandmothers to lose their children," Parrish
said. "When parents go through losing a little one, it's devastating. Most
of us, when we lose one, try to do something to save another one. I think
this program will help to do that."

Subject: To Say Hello


Dear Governor Jeb,
 
      Been a while since I had time to write to you since the Inauguration.  I knew you would be overwhelmed with mail.
My 5 yr old Joshua Seth saw you on the news tonight with George W in Jacksonville and he said that there was Governor Jeb and "he is my friend!"  It reminded me to write and say how much we appreciated the extra "help" and assistance that you and Ann and Gigi  went to  when you invited us.
 
 My Dad almost died the week of Christmas and was in the hospital for a week.  He is doing a lot better this week, but his condition is still guarded.  I am thankful for the prayers of your sweet wife and yourself.
 
I am very worried about the economy.  I am afraid that if things don't change soon, we may have to "throw in the towel"
after 16 years of having a small business.  Our health insurance (Aetna) just went up to more that $850.00 a month for a HMO.  I need to work as an RN, but I am trying to keep my Dad in the comfort of his home and there is no time left.
I have wondered about something now that I am involved in this.  My mother (she is an truss engineer) and is 72 and still working to keep her insurance going and expenses.  I try to stay with my Dad 3 days a week so she can work too.  If we put my Dad in a nursing home(I would never do), it would cost the insurance company thousands....but they will not pay for any assistance during the day for a few hours so that we might work.  The statistics show that patients who are  cared for in a loving and clean home are much less likely to contract germs, and be better cared for at home.  It seems to me that the working people just can't get any help....not from the government, but a break from the red tape of the insurance companies.  If you try to save them money, they will not help you at all.
 
Anyway, it seems that there is something that could be done about that.  If there is x amount of dollars allowed for nursing homes then the patient should receive a reasonable amount for that to aid in home care.   And the crazy thing is here I am an experienced RN and  Hospice sends out these RNs and pays a lot of money  to them...and they really don't do much as I have done it, but yet insurance will not reimburse family members who are licensed health care workers!
I wish there was something we could do to help others who are going through these kind of things.
 
Anyway, didn't mean to write so much, but I know that you as Governor, cannot know some things that are going on in everyday life of the average citizen and I know you care, but can only do so much.
 
I wanted to say how nice everything was for your inauguration.  Michael W. Smith was just great at the celebration and the song really lifted my spirits.  I also wanted to tell you how blessed I feel to have you for our Governor. I pray for you and your family everyday.
 
Well, I have to prepare for my son Johnathan's big day at the State Fair tomorrow.  He will be showing his registered Jersey Cow and her calf "Lucy" tomorrow through Sunday!
 
HAPPY VALENTINES DAY to you and your sweet wife Columba...God Bless.
 
Fondly,

Subject:	Budget cuts - Statewide Prosecutor

The Honorable Jeb Bush:

In reference to the below article summary taken from The Florida Bar service, I submit my opinion.  It might be a mistake to cut in half the budget based on the number of cases handled.  The statewide prosecutor tends to handle the more sophisticated white collar type crimes that the state prosecutor is ill-equipped and tends not to have the infrastructure to handle or handle completely and properly.  These type cases take a lot more time and intense work that my experience shows the state prosecutors tends not to be structured to handle.  Judging the thing based on numbers of cases cleared is not a grounded assessment.  When they handle them, they tend to be settled out in such a manner that the wrong doers tend to get the message that such crimes pay.  To me, publishing such a severe budget cut tends to send a signal to such wrongdoers that they are much more likely to get away with these type of crimes.

GOVERNOR PROPOSES HALVING OFFICE OF STATEWIDE PROSECUTION -- Daily Business Review,  <http://www.dailybusinessreview.com/> http://www.dailybusinessreview.com , Feb. 14, 2003.

The article reports that Governor Jeb Bush has proposed to gut the Office of Statewide Prosecution, the division of the Florida attorney general's office that prosecutes multi-circuit crimes, including white-collar violations. Bush's proposal, set forth in his 2003-2004 budget, calls for a reduction of the OSP's staff from 73 to 35 and cutting its annual budget from $6.2 million to $2.7 million. Bush is under tremendous pressure to chop spending, given declining tax revenues, soaring Medicaid costs and the hugely expensive new mandate from voters to reduce school class size. But his cuts in the OSP also are seen by some observers as a political choice. "We looked at the [OSP's] caseloads and noticed they tended to be lower than what we saw in the state attorneys' offices," said Elizabeth Hirst, the governor's spokeswoman. "Their prosecutors handled less than 12 cases each compared to one state attorneys' office in which the attorneys handled 300 to 400 cases each."

 

Very truly yours,

Dear Friends,
                        The Legislative Session begins on March 4, 2003.  This year we will be tracking all of the Bills related to Charter Schools and news clips.  We will be putting out a "Friday Update" so that we are not sending tons of e-mails to you.  If you wish to contribute to the Friday Update, please send it directly to us.  
 
The next Charter School Appeal Commission is March 6 and 7th in Tallahassee.
 
Important Reminder regarding teacher certification:  Under NCLB the certification requirements for teachers including teachers in Charter Schools has changed.  There was a technical assistance memo sent out to all charter schools last fall from Betty Coxe regarding the specifics of teacher certification and No Child Left Behind.  We will send out Betty's memo via fax next week.
 
Capital Outlay update:  The proposed capital outlay amount for charter schools is only 15 million dollars.  That is the amount in the Governor's budget at this time.  As you may know, this legislative session faces many important issues including funding.  
 
Good News from D.C. and thank you for all of the letters, e-mails and faxes that went out to Senator Bill Young.  Again, our strength has changed the tide on issues.  See Jon's letter below.
 
From Jon Schroeder:
Hello charter friends.

There's good news from Washington on charters and facilities financing.

FEDERAL FACILITIES APPROPRIATIONS FOR FY2003 INCLUDES $242 MILLION FOR
CHARTERS - MAINTAINS SUPPORT FOR START-UP, FACILITIES INITIATIVES
Months behind schedule, the Congress has finally completed action on a $397
billion mega-appropriations bill for the fiscal year that began last October
1.  President Bush has said he will sign the bill that was put together by a
joint House-Senate conference committee.  Congressional action was completed
on the bill on Thursday.  Of particular importance to charters, the final
compromise includes:

* An additional $200 million for the federal charter school grant program -
which funds start-up and dissemination grants to schools, as well as
research, the national conference, the U.S. charter schools web site and
other "national activities" run by the U.S. Department of Education.   This
is the same funding level for these initiatives that was available last
year.

* An additional $25 million to continue the federal charter school
facilities demonstration program.  This program - originally funded at $25
million two years ago - was formally authorized - but not funded -- in the
"No Child Left Behind" legislation last year as part of a two-part
facilities financing initiative sponsored by Senators Tom Carper (D-DE) and
Judd Gregg (R-NH).  This initiative has been strongly supported by the Bush
Administration, which originally proposed $100 million for the program for
FY2003.  The final $25 million appropriation was a compromise between the
House, that had approved $50 million for the demonstration and the Senate,
that had included no funding for this program in its FY2003 appropriations
bill.

* A total of $17 million for several facilities financing initiatives for
charter schools in the District of Columbia.  Four million of this amount
will be used to raise the per pupil facilities allowance during this school
year to at least $1500 per student from its current level of $1237. Of the
remaining $13,000,000, $8,000,000 will be used to increase the charter
school credit enhancement fund and $5,000,000 will be used to establish a
direct loan program to help charter schools acquire facilities.  Although
this is a federal appropriation, it was included in the DC portion of the
appropriations bill - making this, in effect, an example of the kind of
STATE-level facilities initiative that CFNN and state charter organizations
have been promoting around the country.

In addition, the FY2003 appropriations bill includes $26 million for a
voluntary public school choice program that provides grants to districts for
a variety of choice initiatives that could include charters.

For more details on the FY 2003 appropriations bill, go to:
<http://www.house.gov/appropriations/news/108_1/04omnibus.htm> and
<http://www.house.gov/appropriations/info/lhhs_03conf_detail.pdf>

PRESIDENT'S BUDGET FOR FY2004 WOULD LAUNCH PER PUPIL INCENTIVE PROGRAM FOR
STATES, CONTINUE SUPPORT FOR DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM
While Congress was putting finishing touches on the appropriations bill for
THIS fiscal year, President Bush last week announced his budget proposal for
the 2004 fiscal year that begins October 1.  The President's budget proposal
includes two important charter-related initiatives:

* First, an increase in funding for the federal charter grant program from
$200 to $220 million.  Under the "No Child Left Behind" (NCLB) legislation
approved last year, the addition $20 million would be earmarked for a new
program to encourage states to start and expand per pupil facilities aid
programs.  These programs provide additional revenue to schools - on a per
pupil basis - above general operating revenues and other categorical state
aids.  Under NCLB, states could apply for grants to match new spending on
such programs.  The percentage match would decline for five years and then
be withdrawn completely, leaving responsibility for funding the programs
with the state.  A few states now have such programs including Minnesota,
Colorado, Florida, Arizona, California and, as noted above, the District of
Columbia.

* Second, an additional $100 million to continue the federal charter school
facilities demonstration program.

The President's FY 2004 budget proposal also includes an additional $25
million for the voluntary public school choice program, $75 million for a
broader school choice incentive program and $226 million in refundable
educational tax credits for parents.  The latter two proposals are intended
to help finance the transfer of students from public schools identified for
improvement under the "No Child Left Behind" initiative to high-performing
district, private or charter schools.

For more on the charter and choice provisions in the President's FY 2004
budget proposal, go to:
<http://www.ed.gov/PressReleases/01-2003/01312003.html>

* * * * *

Congressional appropriations committees are expected to take up the FY 2004
appropriations proposals within a few weeks - making it important that
charter school leaders and supporters around the country again gear up to
communicate their interest and support with their own members of Congress.

Subject:	FW: Sen. Burt Saunders meeting


Bill Schoen, Chairman of the Board of Health Management Associates,  and I met with Sen. Saunders today on med-mal reform.

The key points of the meeting are as follows:

1.	Burt says he fully  supports the Governor's task force's proposal, including Caps on non-economic damages.
2.	There will be 5 or 6 separate bills filed on different aspects of med-mal that will all originate in Burt's committee.
3.	He says Senate President King has moved along way in the past few months and that King has now said okay to Burt filling a bill with the Caps recommended in the task force report.  He said "not that King supports Caps himself, but that he will let it pass if it can gain 21 votes"  (This is how a leader leads?)
4.	Burt expressed concern that FMA and FHA need to do a better job in bringing the right doctors and patients to Tallahassee to testify.
5.	At our urging he has agreed to hold a town hall meeting in Naples on Feb. 24 and invite doctors, patients and citizens to share their concerns.  We are helping him organize it, and will tape it so that he can share the most compelling stories with his fellow committee members.



I am concerned that the Senate plan is to allow Caps to pass out of Burt's health care committee (read that King has agreed to let Burt off the hook) only to be killed in another committee.  Burt said it would likely be sent to Judiciary and Approps.  He also pointed out that Villalobos, Chair of Judiciary, is a trial atty. and will be opposed to caps and that Pruitt was close to trial bar, too.

Schoen and I made it clear to Burt that just passing it through his committee was not enough.  It is his bill and he must take responsibility for getting it passed in the full Senate.

Subject:	welfare reform bill

Governor: 

When my husband left me about 30 odd years ago with 2 babies (1 ½ and 3) , I
was forced to go on welfare.  Thank God I had a wonderful social worker who
pushed me into college.  I went full time, worked in the cafeteria 20 hours
a week and took care of my babies the rest of the time.  

In 3 and ½ years I received my bachelor's, a 3.75 cumulative grade point
average, and never had to darken  the doors of the welfare office again.  

This is why I fight so hard for welfare moms.  

I think the present bill is fine except for 2 problems:  education should be
considered a work activity and if a mom is in college or vocational training
full time, 20 hours should be the minimum for working.  

This is a much more compassionate approach because the mom needs to spend
time with her children, do her college assignments, go to school and work.
I had an old car which got me back and forth. 

However, down here moms most moms are required to take the bus and most have
to take at least 4 a day. They take the children to child care and then they
go to school.  Some even take 6 busses a day.  

As you know, I am now an attorney. I have been one for over 20 years.  I
know how successful the new welfare reform bill can be.  The welfare bill
signed by President Clinton was not a compassionate bill.  It dumped the
majority of welfare moms off the system instead of helping them get
education.  Do you know how many of these moms could be nurses, case workers
and teachers?  Many of my clients are becoming  LPNs. If we make it
impossible for them to manage their families and go to school and go to
work, they will fail as mothers, students, and as contributors to society. 

Governor: I know what I am talking about.  I have been there and done that.


As one of your biggest fans here in Broward County, I pray that you give
this message to your brother. He cares and does such good for the country.
This bill affects mostly women and we must do it right. 

One other thing:  I think we need to enlarge the time a brand new mother
must go out and work from 3 months to at least 1 year. When I was on
welfare, a mother could nurture her baby up to 3 years and then was required
to work and go to school. One year would at least give her time to bond
which is so incredibly important for a healthy baby.

Subject:	Re: prison industry 

Dear Judy:
If the prison system was ran by the Educational Department, we would have less recidivism.  I have watched as some Institutions treat the Programs Department as an ugly step child...one they have to tolerate, but they think it a nuisance (and I don't mean a matter of needed security).  

I believe that our programs department gets all the goody out of every dollar that they are given.  I fight every day to have those dollars increased by legislature, because those programs have positive effects on inmates' futures. 

The legislature is putting the money where it does the least good, in length of sentence, not in correcting the offensive behavior, and providing the skills for a different life option.

It doesn't take money to have a good wholesome attitude towards the subjects you are housing, it takes training and good quality people.  

It also takes a mind set that officers do not have the right to dispense punishment as they please.  I do not see any indication that boot marks on an inmates dead body carries any consequences for errant officers, or administration for that matter.  Don't condone abuse?  I have not seen anything to show me otherwise.  If corruption and abuse isn't stopped, if a fair and just due process system is not implemented, it is the same as letting it continue, and condoning the abuse of power.

		Just got the results of a statewide poll we had done by the Tarrance Group between Feb 11th and the 13th.  Unbelievable!
		I realize you are about to leave on your trade mission to Spain but knew you would have your lap top.
		 
		(1)  The biggest highlight is that 85.7% support a proposal to cap the amount of money that a patient could be rewarded for non economic damages - sometimes called "pain and suffering" to $250,000.  Only 11.3% support keeping the system the way it is currently.
		 
		(2)  79.2% agree with the statement "The Florida Legislature should take action to ensure that doctors have protection from excessive medical malpractice lawsuits."  18.2% disagree with that statement.
		 
		(3)  81.8% said they would be more likely to support reforms if they knew that "maternity care has been mostly affected by the medical malpractice insurance crisis, with seven Florida hospitals being forced to close their maternity units due to liability costs."
		 
		(4)  81.1% said they would be more likely to support reforms if they knew that "because of Florida's out of control medical malpractice lawsuit system, many good doctors are leaving Florida and it is difficult to recruit new doctors to the state."  
		 
		(5)  80.4% said they would be more likely to support reforms if they knew that "The U.S. Dept of Health and Human Services says that limiting unreasonable awards for non economic damages would reduce the cost of healthcare for everyone by 5 to 9%, without sacrificing quality of care."
		 
		(6)  80.1% said they would be more likely to support reforms if they knew that "several mammography centers in Florida have closed due to the high cost of liability insurance -- reducing access to breast cancer screening for many women."
		 
		(7)  37.6% cited affordability as their greatest concern with regards to health care.  32.5% cited frivolous lawsuits driving the best doctors out of the state as their greatest concern.  16.1% cited access to the doctor of their choice as their greatest concern.
		 
		(8)  41% blame the trial attorneys for the medical liability insurance crisis.  15.6% blame the insurance companies.  11.3% blame incompetent doctors and 32.1% blame other factors (such as hospitals, court system and the legislature.)
		 
		Once you get back, I'd be pleased to give you a copy of the polling results but thought you might like to see this info.  Unless you think we should do it differently, I planned to give Jim King, Tom Lee, Johnny Byrd,  Allan Bense, and Dudley Goodlette a copy probably on Tuesday.  We would follow up with a press conference on the info on Wednesday.  Let me know if you think there is a better strategy.
		 
		Talked to Liza today about several reading projects.  Once you get back maybe we can throw around a couple ideas.  Also heard a very interesting tidbit that I want to pass on.  I may call Sally.

For the first time on 9 months, Governor Bush we felt that we were rewarded and appreciated by the State of Florida.  You have thanked me, but no one else has expressed their gratitude the way he did. 

But who cares at this point, we have a beautiful Son.  Once again, Governor Bush thank you so much for completing our family and saving a life.,

I will let you know when the adoption party will be. You and your beuatiful Wife have to attend!  We definitely discussed it, and want to make you the God Parent for Max. After all, you Governor Bush saved our Son's life!  God only knows where he would be today, without your support.

This is the best Valentine's Day ever!

Dear Jeb:

We had a 911 call to meet at Crisis Center at 9am today and I wanted to make you aware of the situation as you care about the Center like I do.

Our CEO Dennis Ross, was arrested on Wednesday am.  Upon hearing the news and after discussion with board executives, staff and legal counsel, I share with you that Dennis is experiencing clinical depression and is cognizant of his condition.  He has never been arrested, prior to this even. He was arrested for carrying a pistol with a license.

The depression is related, in part, to his ongoing challenge in dealing with his son's suicide, Len 1987, which has been further compounded by other personal issues, and his professional role as CEO of the Crisis Center. like all of us working in the current economic climate, business and not profits alike, he is dealing with budget issues that could affect the Crisis Center's  ability to promote mental wellness, which is his personal and professional crusade.

Dennis has spoken to proper persons at center and is embarrassed and ashamed of his arrest.

He is seeking intensive treatment and has the full support of the board, wife and family.

Dennis is an example of how depression can affect anyone-regardless of socio-economic status, race, gender, job, position in community, etc.
I 
I know how busy you are but should you want to talk to him for a minute to wish him well, his home number is 727-397-5695.

Dear Gov. BUSH:
This is in response to Sec. Regiers current "ideas" regarding proposed changes in DCF legislation. There are hundreds of unhappy district 4 employees of both DCF and CBC's. When we voted you in a second time we thought you were concerned about "Florida's most vulnerable citizens." First  concern is salaries and unemployment.  The CBC's are not consistent with hiring capable people from DCF, those with NEEDED experience to work with and protect Florida's abused and neglected children. The salaries are nowhere near those of DCF, and the CBC's here ARE NOT limiting case load sizes as suggested by Mr. Regier. 
My next concern is the issue of training. WHY are YOU trying to change the training agency for DCF/CBC's  after 15 years?? Training is one of the ONLY areas that came out in a positive light as a result of the Blue Ribbon Panel.
The CBC's in this district are having their employees take a case from post-detention though adoption, which means that any staff they hire from DCF IS NOT EXPERIENCED in all areas. FOR example, a Foster care worker has no knowledge of ADOPTIONS. This cant be learned from reading statutes. I can understand a RFP being sent out, but I cant understand why this cant wait until next year after all the employee transitioning have taken place. WOULDN'T THAT MAKE MORE SENSE? 
In addition, no one is considering the investigators that are remaining with DCF. Who will train them? The sheriffs office?  After Kayla McKean, the police would respond to child abuse calls and tell families everything looked fine, then we as PI's  would then  respond  and detain because of safety issues where crimes hadn't been commited.My question, How is someone who has Never done the job going to train people, and as we know, an integral component of any training process is integrating life experience.

But in a Jan. 28 referendum the people of Oregon voted 54% to 46% to cut state spending by $310 million rather than raise income taxes by 0.5% to balance the budget."

My point is this - float a new referendum, put a real price tag on it for every man,woman and child, - and the voters will dump the rapid rail system and the class size obligations overboard in a hurry - problem solved.

As you are probably aware, Jo Ann Hutchinson is retiring from state
government after many years of leadership to the Department of
Transportation and the Commission for the Transportation Disadvantaged.  We
are throwing her a retirement dinner on March 19, 2003, and would like to
request that you speak at the dinner.  She would be honored to have you say
a few words about her unfailing dedication to the State of Florida's most
vulnerable citizens.

If you think this is a possibility, please let me know.  Attached below is
the invitation to her event.  Thank you for considering this request.

Subject: Vision of the New Florida High School Graduate


Hello-
I wanted to share with you an idea I've been working on (it needs tweaking but it's a beginning):
 
 

 

Vision of the new Florida High School Graduate

 

 

 

 

The State of Florida is committed to have all students compete effectively in the global, knowledge-based economy of the twenty-first century and to meet the highest academic standards both nationally and internationally. No child will be left behind with Florida's new seamless, student focused Education system. With results-focused accountability, students in elementary, middle and high school will obtain a 

high level of applied academic knowledge and skills allowing our High School senior class of 2010 to graduate with the skills and knowledge needed to attend college without remediation and/or obtain a demanding professional or technical credential leading to a career that will allow them to enter the workforce immediately and compete in a global knowledge based society.

 

 

 

I hope I'm not out of line, because I truly don't mean to be and I hope I'm not bothering you with this.  I just feel like it's the right thing to do....to see if you are interested in this.  I believe I have found a model that exists that can help us reach the above goal and some of your goals set forth for Education in Florida.  

 
 
Would you be interested in discussing this with me?  I am very excited about what I've seen to date and anxious to explore further, however, it has to be something that you, the Secretary and the State are interested in also.
 
 
I hope you have a great day.  Happy Birthday!

Good afternoon Governor Bush,
     
     I know you busy so I'll try to keep it brief.  Hope you and your family are doing well, so far the flu gug has passed us by here thank heavens.
I am suppose to attend an Awards Dinner for Okaloosa County's Athletes of the Year on the 22nd of FebruaryI which a friend of mine and fellow Family Care Council Member Kenneth  Robinson will receive the award for Special Olympics Athlete of the Year.   I wanted to ask your permission that when the presentations are made  that I can give them congratulations from You Governor Jeb Bush for a job well done?  I didn't want to do this without your permission, but as chairman of the Family Care Council in District 1,  I am sort of representing you and the State of Florida here.  I will await your answer and please keep up the good work and stay safe in the perilous times........................Your friend always Darrell Walker

Subject: Our Heroes Luncheon



Dear Governor Bush:

Chief Deputy David Gee asked me to contact you via e-mail regarding an invitation being extended to you and to Pres. Bush by the committee planning the annual "Our Heroes Luncheon" on May 9 at the Tampa Convention Center.

The luncheon was begun several years ago by John Sykes of Sykes Enterprises, to honor law enforcement.  Since then, it has grown to include all of law enforcement, firefighters and the military in Hillsborough County.  Last year, you were kind enough to call in to the luncheon which was attended by 5,000.  The same number or more are expected this year.

The luncheon sponsors, Sykes Enterprises, J. P. Morgan and Red Baron Pizza, underwrite the cost of the event allowing members of the honored agencies to attend with a guest at no cost.

At the luncheon, Mr. Sykes provides 4 four-year scholarships to children of officers with the Tampa Police Department and the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office.

There is a large display of public safety equipment.

Monies raised from the sale of corporate tickets are donated to the Gold Shield Foundation to assist the widows and children of emergency response personnel who die in the line of duty.

I have an invitation packet with more detailed information which I would like to forward to you.  Would you let me know if there is a particular individual who should receive it?

 Included in the package is a second invitation directed to President Bush inviting him to join us also, which we hope you can forward to him for us.  It would be a great honor for all of these emergency response and military personnel to have both of you in attendance.

I might add that this is the biggest event of its kind in the nation.

I can be reached by phone at (813) 247-8010, by fax at (813) 247-0980, by mail at Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office, P. O. Box 3371, Tampa, FL 33601, or by e-mail at "lbitetto@hcso.tampa.fl.us".

Thank you for taking time to read this and for considering our invitation.

Dear Gov. Bush,
I am a Kindergarten teacher in Jacksonville at Chets Creek Elementary School. 
 I am very pleased with the new changes in education.  However, I do have a 
concern that I do not think has been addressed yet in the State of Florida.  
As our school continues to start earlier, the age requirement has not 
changed.  As of right now you can start Kindergarten if you turn 5 years old 
before September 1st.  Because of this date, I often have 4 year olds in my 
room for the first month of school.  In the past 13 years I have taught, 
typically the children with summer birthdays are not as ready developmentally 
for school.  As standards are raised these very young students are 
struggling.  I would like to see the date changed from September 1st to June 
1st.  I feel by changing the age requirement we will notice the retention 
rate go down.  Thank you for your concern with educational issues.

Dear Gov. Bush:
 
We need your hand and the hand of your brother to step in for us.  I can no longer afford to fill the tank of my car. 20 dollars will only give me 10 gallon of gasoline now.  If I try and fill my car it will take 46 dollars, I depend on my income for a tank of gasoline to get me around and the rest goes to food and bills and rent.
 
They just announced on bay News 9 TV that the recent price inflations have nothing to do with the pending "Gulf War" they say that Opec has not raised their prices and that the companies are price gouging us.  You are our Governor and we need you right now and we need your help.
 
What is a guy like me supposed to do with what is going on?  This is not right for the state of Florida and the United States to have to be drug through the mud and left to financially bleed like this while the gasoline companies or individual gasoline marts are taking advantage of us and no one seems to be minding the store for us the Americans.
 
Please you have got to stop this and demand these companies and individual stores from gouging us into the dirt. There are stations in this area that are now charging 2.00 a gallon for gasoline and the cheapest now here is 1.88 per gallon.
 
This Is an American Crime.  We have our own Oil in Alaska and yet we are made to think that it is OPEC etc...  American Government needs to step in and help it's own people.  I lobe and appreciate you as our Governor very much. I voted for you, but we are in a time we need to see your hand and authority move on our behalf. This is a Crime what the companies are doing to us. Please help me and help us.

Dear Governor Bush,
I just came from State of the County Address by
Mayor Alex Penela.Today,I saw more unity and seeing
Mayor Manny Diaz, and Mayor Miami Beach and few others
and plus strong and solid presentation by Dr.Barbara
Carey-Shuler .
The most important areas attention directed to 
Health Care(present problems of Health Trust),
Aviation (changing powers for contracts/bids)
Tranportation(most important issue for communities)
And bringing office of protocol International
Trade and Commerce Center in Miami(Mayor seeks your
support).

Governor!I have suggestion that it is important before
session starts in Tallahsee, there should be 
atleast three town meetings where you can hear the
communties views and concerns so that our elected
officials make right decisions during Budget
discussion.
I must say that after longtime, I am seeing new fresh
air of Unity among the leaderships.

Governor!Please whenever if you get time, please
follow
my interest to get into either Homeland Secruity or
Faith Based Initiative.

Thankyou very much.

Dear Jeb: 
Ellie Kay, a close writer friend of mine is going to be on World News Tonight with Peter Jennings on February 13th at 7 p.m.  She recently authored the book, Heroes at Home:  Help & Hope for America's Military Families.  Ellie's husband, Bob, is a Stealth fighter pilot with the U.S. Air Force.    Ellie has been asked to be on the panel during Peter Jenning's town meeting on the War. 
      After Ellie agreed to serve on the panel, she learned that it may be a set up and may actually be a huge anti-war rally staged before your brother's announcement of War against Iraq.  Ellie may be the only Pro-Bush member on the panel.  Is there any way that she can get a military briefing on the case for war so that she can be prepared to answer questions they might use to try to throw her off guard????  Ellie is very articulate and I think she'll make a strong support for your brother if she is coached a little. 
Ellie Kay lives in Alamogordo, NM  Her phone is (505) 439-5464 
Her cell phone is (505) 442-9026     Her e-mail is ellie@elliekay.com

Highlights of those meetings included: DHS's input on layout, design, technology, baggage/passenger safety, terminal features, surrounding land use; benefits to Eglin/Tyndall, BRAC/encroachment improvements; and Vieques training relocation to the panhandle.  

As best we can tell, the new Panama City airport may be one of only 2 or 3 airports in the US which may be constructed in the next 10-15 years. 

Yesterday we discussed the Homeland meetings with the local print media. They are preparing a Sunday article on Homeland Security and the Panama City Airport relocation and hope to ask you a few questions when you are here Friday night. 

If you need any additional information let me know. Also, Stephanie Kopelousos and Dan Ostergarrd of your Washington office were in those meetings and can give you more detail if you want it. We are expecting followup meetings with DHS when they get into their new office. 

What are you speaking on at the Valentines Dinner Friday night? The economy or love? William

Subject: FLORIDA TEACHER SHORTAGE


Dear Governor Bush, 

I know that providing an educational system that meets the needs of all of Florida's children has been a priority of your administration.  I know the words, "no child left behind", are words that have true meaning to you and the President.

Your have a very crucial decision to make regarding your selection of a new Lt. Governor.  I would like to encourage you to select a teacher for this position.  I know that Mr. Thrasher has received strong support from the Republican Party.  He is a politically popular candidate within the Republican Party, but he will not provide the Republican Party the opportunity to bring Florida's educators back to the Republican Party and bring the teacher support and votes to President Bush in 2004.  

We need to unite Florida's educators in their support of your and the President's educational initiatives.   The teacher's union has moved our teachers far away from the Republican Party and provided strong support for most Democratic candidates.  It is going to take a bold move to shift our teachers back.

Republicans are against teachers and Democrats are for teachers has become so dominate and politicalized by our teacher's union that our teachers almost automatically dismiss Republican educational initiatives and Republican canadates as bad for teachers.  Florida's teacher never endorsed Mr. Brogan as one of their own.  He is a fine man, but did not have the experience as an "in the trenches educator" that Florida's teachers respect. Teachers listen to teachers.  The only rhetoric that is currently being fed back to teachers on a consistent basis has been supplied by the union.  They listen to this rhetoric because they have built up a high level of trust for the unions and a high level of distrust for a Republican administration.

The building of trust between Florida's teachers and the Bush administration needs to begin now.  Florida's children need to continue to be provided with the educational programs that will help them to continue to grow and prosper.  Our children are America's future.  They need to be provided with the tools that will continue to help our Nation grow and prosper.

What a wonderful recruitment tool Florida and our Nation would have would have to combat our growing teacher shortage - a teacher as Lt. Governor of Florida.  Please make the bold move to put our teachers behind our Republican agenda.  Our children need our teachers and our teachers need your support.

Sincerely,

Jeanne Keisling


PS.  I know your schedule is busy on Thursday, but do try to come by Mandarin Oaks Elementary - you will see a quality educational program and a dedicated group of teachers.

Subject: Faith Based Reading Program


Dear Governor Bush,

 

In response to the call for Faith Based programs, we  feel you would be interested in a Reading program which is making a difference in  the West Pasco Area. 

 

We are located at Covenant Christian Church, 6814 Indiana Ave., New Port Richey, which is pastored by Bob Panariello.  Pastor Bob also chairs Council 6 of the Department of Juvenile Justice Faith Based Initiative.

We call it the Reading Club and our goal is to help children develop a love of reading.  The Reading Club was started  in October 2001 with the mission of offering free reading tutoring to children ages 7-17 who were in some way in need of assistance in that area.  Our program has since grown and changed with the needs of our participants, and we are excited by all that is happening here at Covenant Christian Church!! 

 Our core program involves the use of volunteer "coaches" who  work with each child to strengthen the skills they already have by emphasizing  letter sounds and decoding skills, since this seems to be the most obvious weakness for our students. We also use a number of educational hands-on games & manipulatives we have either created or adapted to better suit the needs of our kids.   We  have ten personal computers at this time and the educational computer programs give the kids the opportunity to exercise their reading & comprehension skills while providing a great incentive!  

Since November 2002, many of the children in the Reading Club have taken on a new endeavor---they are now authors & illustrators of their own books!!  As of this date most of the children have completed the editing process and their manuscripts have been typed.  They have begun their illustrations and will soon be working on the layout, paste-up, and manual binding of their books!!  This group project has helped to develop their skills in spelling, grammar punctuation, research, and--of course--reading!!  It has also been wonderful to see the excitement in the children who were sure that they *couldn't* write a book.  We are planning to incorporate public speaking skills into the *curricullum* for the 2003--04 year.  These peripheral areas address the same needs in different ways so that the children continue to be challenged and enthusiastic toward what they are accomplishing!! 

The Reading Club sessions are 8-weeks long, with an average break of 2 weeks in between each session. We meet every Friday from 4:30 to 5:30pm, with healthy after-school snacks served at 4:15pm. 

Children are welcome to join the club at any point in the session, as the programs are individualized to the needs of each child.  However it is important that there is a commitment from both parent and child to attend consistently once they have joined.  As the club grows, more volunteer coaches are added to the team in order to adequately meet the needs of the students, so they count on the children to attend regularly.  Parents are also required volunteer as a Reading Coach  once every 4 weeks....that works out to exactly 2  Fridays-- 1 hour each Friday--and in return their child receives eight Fridays of quality reading attention.  Parents are required to work with a child *other than their own*--since parents often say that their child is resistant to learn schoolwork from them after they've been in school.  The parental involvement has been an outstanding arrangement for several reasons: 1) the parents are trained as coaches so they are given tools to work with their child at home;2) the children see that the parents support what they are doing & take an active interest; 3) it helps the coaches to form a close relationship with the parents involved so that there is real trust & open communication. 

Assessments are done on the child's first and last day of each session.  This way we can track the child's progress as well as targeting their individual needs.  The assessment is very basic and not to be taken as the child's *grade level*--it is only a tool to measure their improvement.  Grade level assessments can be very subjective since there are so many factors that could affect even the creation of the test itself. 

Ensuring the continued growth and success of this program requires the assurance of both printed and practical resources.  Obviously consistent, dedicated volunteers are the key to a program of this sort.  Phonics based reading material, computer parts & software, transportation options, even adequate meeting space are all just as important in meeting the needs of the children served.

Thank you so much for your interest and support of the Reading Club at Covenant Christian Church.  Please consider this an open invitation to visit our program and meet our kids.... we would all be honored!!

Governor,

Below are "introductions" and EMAIL addresses to three officers of the Fla
NG who are deployed overseas and with whom we keep in touch.

jerry.vaughn@us.army.mil
Colonel Jerry Vaughn has been mobilized and is in a "middle eastern" country
very near Iraq.  He is commander of the Special Operations
Detachment-Central Command and is responsible for a group of NG soldiers. He
was previously a full-time employee with the Fla NG as Director of Human
Resources Department. A former commander of Camp Blanding. Jump Qualified
and "snake eater".

lisa.craig@usarmy.mil
Lieutenant Colonel Lisa Craig (abbreviated LTC) is deployed to Quantanamo
Bay, Cuba. Lisa is the commander of a military Finance Battalion and has
young children at home in St. Augustine.  She has performed superbly in a
variety of command and staff assignments in the Fla NG.

david.nelson@us.army.mil
Colonel Benny Nelson is deployed to Kabul, Afghanistan as the commander of
the 930th Army Forces Liaison Team.  He was formerly employed as a full time
commander of the Fla Nat'l Guard Regional Training Institute, responsible
for our Officer Candidate School and Non-Commissioned Officer leadership
academy. His wife is a retired NCO from the Fla Nat'l Guard.

I think it would be good to exchange EMAILS with these leaders and they
will, in turn, send your support to their troops, either at commanders call,
morning staff meetings, or by re-transmit of all or part of your message.

Let me know if you would like to get names below these levels that work for
these folks. We don't have other leadership or troops on station in foreign
countries with EMAIL access as of this message, however,  they are being
sent there daily, so I will have more EMAIL addresses for your shortly. 

Many of our soldiers will not have "total" and open access to the internet,
however, as these theatres "mature", one of the first items to be on station
are computers with internet access for "reaching back" home.

Will stay "on" this.

Regards,

Doug

Danish parliamentarians, educators visit Collegis


Visiting dignitaries get briefed on outsourcing IT in higher education

By Matt Gomez 

Danish butter cookies and pastries graced the conference table as dignitaries from Denmark visited Collegis corporate headquarters to learn more about opportunities for outsourcing technology in higher education.

The visit, sponsored by Valencia Community College, followed by one day a tour of the Valencia West campus featuring the work of the Office of Information Technology (OIT), which is staffed by a majority of Collegis employees. The Danish parliamentarians had requested that they meet with one of Valencia's business partners during their visit, and Valencia chose Collegis.

Bill White, executive director at Valencia, and Larry Humes, Collegis vice president of marketing and communication, presented on behalf of Collegis. Joe Redwine, Collegis director of network services, led the visitors on a tour of the Network Operations Center (NOC).

The presentation, which sparked many questions about Collegis' vendor-neutrality, positive return on technology investment in higher education and the pervasiveness of e-learning, was quite an eye-opener for the visitors.

  <http://myportal.collegis.com/images/Torben%20Hansen%20(Denmark)..jpg> 	
Torben Hansen, a member of the Danish parliament and associate professor at the Copenhagen Business School <http://www.cbs.dk/indexuk.html> , came away very impressed. 


"Collegis' comprehensive approach toward technology management and learning technologies is a construct we have not seen before," Hansen said. "We have outsourcing in Denmark, but not to the extent that you offer it here in higher education. Most schools in Denmark have IT staffs of two or three people and they do things on their own, but not on a grand scale."

Hansen said Denmark, with a national population of only 5 million (roughly the same as the combined population of Chicago, Ill. and Houston, Texas), could benefit greatly from Collegis' services, but it will take some cultural conditioning to make the business case.

"Valencia is much larger than the colleges and universities in Denmark, which usually have about 12,000 students in higher education," Hansen said. "As our colleges and universities grow, it becomes impossible for them to handle all of the technology services by themselves, so I was very impressed by what I saw at Valencia.

"Many of the technology systems at universities in Denmark are provided by the Ministry of Education," he continued. "We have Oracle and Microsoft, but not the kind of companies that Collegis mentioned today as business and technology partners. Vendors in Denmark primarily sell their own products, but they have to have the approval of the Ministry of Education in order to generate business."

Individual business deals are not conducted as in the United States, but the colleges and universities in Denmark are all trying to get a better handle on improved teaching and learning opportunities through technology, Hansen said. Many Danish schools now offer online registration and e-learning, with Danish students falling into the category of adult learners, which could provide opportunities similar to those offered by Collegis Curriculum Solutions.

"Danes typically leave high school and enter the job market for a few years before attending university," Hansen said. "Many students are 24-25 years old and most are women, many of whom are interested in teaching. We have an upcoming teacher shortage, with many of our present teachers approaching retirement age, so it will be interesting to see if e-learning could help train teachers from various parts of Denmark to address the shortage."

Collegis services are offered exclusively to higher education institutions in the United States, but the prospect of international business is intriguing. Hansen extended an offer for Collegis to come to Denmark for a tour of Danish schools.

"Our system is different and the schools may not be as large as what you may be accustomed to in the United States, but perhaps Denmark can be a testing ground for international expansion," he said.

Subject: Re: Placement of ADM


Dear Governor Bush,
	I have grave concerns in regard to the future placement of the Alcohol,
Drug Abuse and Mental Health department (ADM).  After reviewing Mr.
Regier's comments stating that he preferred to leave ADM within DCF
because they are so closely related to their child welfare mission is not
an acceptable solution.  Would this mean that the Health Department
should be placed under DCF because children need health care?  Should our
housing programs be brought into DCF because children need a place to
live? Should we place Juvenile Justice under DCF because our children use
these services?  Our child welfare system should not be based on where an
office or department  is  located but rather on the accessibility of
quality services.  
	I have been a consumer advocate for mental health for 13 years and the
reality from my perspective is that the continuous reorganization of DCF
has never organized anything.  It has always been a very costly
"rearrangement" of administration.  What the children and adults of this
state need are appropriate, accessible "choices" of services based on the
individuals personal needs for health and economic recovery.
	As a consumer of mental health services I feel that ADM needs to be
placed within the Health Department.  Mental illness is a health issue. 
These biological illnesses affect the most important organ in the
body..."the brain".  It is also misleading to refer to individuals who
are in treatment or those who would like to seek treatment as "behavioral
health" clients, as if our behavior dictates our brain disorders.  It is
quite the opposite.  Among all the brain diseases and disorders only
mental illness is referred to as "behavioral".  It is time to focus on
mental "wellness".  Below are a few suggestions:
	1.  Establish ADM as a division of the Health Department
	2.  The administrator of the department should be a clinically qualified
professional whose specific training and experience is in mental health
and substance abuse.
	3.  Create district oversight committees consisting of clinical
professionals, consumers, family members, law enforcement and individuals
within the community.  This will provide additional accountability and an
opportunity to develop a  partnership of shared problems and solutions
among the districts.  
	4.  Develop flexible funding based on outcomes instead of population and
income.  Continue to support and adequately fund programs that provide
choice of services based on individual needs such as the Self Directed
Care Program in District 4.   
	5.  Provide independent monitoring and evaluations of services with the
focus on outcomes and consumer satisfaction.  Accountability is essential
not just for budget purposes but for the health and recovery of
individuals who receive or who are seeking services for mental health
and/or substance abuse.
	For me, recovery was the discovery of my potential and my responsible
limits.  As a participant in the Self Directed Care program I will be
able to continue to effectively challenge my potential.  I am thankful
that my perception of recovery went beyond stabilization.  
	Where ever ADM is placed please remember that without responsible
leadership, adequate funding, appropriate/accessible services, and
accountable spending, the only outcomes will be uncontrolled illness,
unemployment, poverty, homelessness and death.    	
	I look forward to your comments concerning this issue.

Sincerely,
Nancy D. Fudge (Consumer Advocate/MH)

Guard


Governor,

As a follow-up to your EMAIL last night, I wanted to provide you three
options for visiting Florida National Guard troops.  The 631st Maintenance
Company in Starke has been mobilized and will be moving out to Fort Stewart
at 9:00 am Sunday (February 16).  These "going away" events normally draw a
large number of families and community members.  If you can attend, I would
recommend you arrive around 8:00 am to work the crowd of soldiers and
families.  We will set up a podium for you to speak to everyone; it is very
likely there will also be media present.  Rep. Aaron Bean has also indicated
an interest in attending this event, as the unit is in his district.
Keystone Heights Airport is only 8 miles south of Starke and has adequate
runways. You have flown into this airport previously.

If that event does not meet your schedule, we can schedule a day for you at
Fort Stewart to visit the Florida National Guard soldiers deployed there.
We currently have two battalions and two separate companies at Fort Stewart
that are undergoing training.  If you could give me days that might work for
you I can see what type of training is being conducted and make a
recommendation for a specific date.

One other option is to visit our troops while you are Eglin Air Force Base
on February 28 for the Base Commanders meeting.  We have soldiers from the
146th Signal Battalion (Jacksonville) that are part of the base security at
Eglin.  About 50-60 troops guarding Eglin. Would be difficult to get the
whole group together, but you could visit them around the base at their
security posts.

I will be meeting with Ms. Shanahan tomorrow so I can discuss this with her
at that time.  I truly appreciate your continued support of our Florida
National Guard personnel.

Regards,

Doug

Dear Governor Bush,

I wanted to drop you a quick note to thank you for your patience as I worked out the details that would allow me to accept the DMS role.  Secretary Griffin explained to me where we were in the process.  I wanted you to know that I am excited that the opportunity still exists and look forward to serving if called upon.

I have worked hard over the last few weeks to effect a separation that delivers against your timeline.  I am happy to let you know that I will now be free and clear in April (vs July).   Understanding your immediate needs in that Department, if selected, I will spend the intervening few weeks studying and transitioning where appropriate in order to hit the ground at a full sprint!
 
Whatever the outcome, I am honored to be considered and look forward to participating in any way possible.

I read that you are focusing on reforming workers' compensation in Florida.
 
This is a matter Governor Voinovich tackled in the 1990's when our monopolistic, state-run, Bureau of Workers' Compensation was known as the "silent killer of jobs."
 
Many of those who reformed the system are still around and would, I believe, be happy to provide thier insight as to their experiences - if you think it worthwhile and valuable.

I enjoyed so much being at the VIP picnic at Tropical Park and subsequently we attended every one of the inaugural events.  It was one of the highlights of my wife and my political experiences.  I am so pleased that I made the decision to participate in the Democrats for Jeb organization and while I couldn't make the press conference at the Fontainebleau, I was pleased to lend my name and support.

It is a sports tax rebate bill based on the model of other sports rebate bills.  I know from personal discussions with Larry Pendleton of the Sports Foundation that you're not a fan of these bills.  But, I would like to stress the importance of these funds to the City of Homestead in the economic development of our infrastructure, road improvements and, most importantly, the safety of our citizens.  Governor Bush, if we receive these funds, I assure you the City of Homestead will administer these funds to the necessary improvements listed above.

This legislation would create a similarly fashioned rebate for the Homestead Motorsports Complex - grand prix racing is the only "major league" sport not recognized in the law today - and it is the largest spectator sport in the world today.  

We've met with Pam Dana of OTTED and David Bishop in her office and based on their thoughts and those of Larry Pendleton we are changing the original language establishing a baseline of the year 2000 - and we will only request our rebate out of increased revenues from the year 2000 on - so the state will basically be held harmless from current revenue.

Governor, these dollars are needed so that we can keep pace with the other tracks around the country - this is highly competitive and we've been privileged to host some of the premiere racing events in the country.  The France family which has a long term lease on the track just last week told other tracks that if they didn't boost attendance they were going to lose their events.

I don't have to tell you a thing about l992 and Hurricane Andrew except to say that this has been THE economic engine of South Dade since then.  That's why rather than a tax rebate bill we're calling this an economic development bill.

We've spoken with Rep. Randy Johnson, chair of House Finance and Tax and before he'll put our legislation on his agenda he needs some indication from you that you'll let it become law if we are successful in the legislature.

Our sponsors are Rep. Juan Carlos Zapata in the House and Senator Alex diaz de la Portilla, the President Pro-Tempore in the Senate.

Governor - we need this Bill - it has been carried in the past by Rep. Ken Sorensen who will co-sponsor and indicates that at one point you did indicate support for the Bill but it was too late in the process to gain passage.

Can you please give me some idea how you feel about this.  Jim Magill in your office has been provided with some economic data on this by Jennifer Rubinas from Bob Levy's office who represents our City.  This reflects a growing out of state tourism element which I know is a key to this type of legislation.

I respectfully look forward to what I hope will be a positive response Governor.

Subject: RE: Near Term Economic Impact


Governor, a few thoughts in response to your question.  Scenario 1: Short War (less than two weeks- Iraq disarmed) - minimal impact to current tourism situation (still need to emphasize stimulus to regain international tour business); defense will remain a growth industry due to threat of terrorism and should be supported within the state; security related industries remain strong as well as R&D that supports security of the homeland. In all scenarios building infrastructure to support new industrial development should be a strong priority (e.g. transportation, communications, power, capital availability) This is as much to attract new business, to expand existing business and to continue to be a desired retirement location for future retirees as it is to respond to the immediate situation of war. Scenario 2: War lasts two to six months (Iraq disarmed) - Tourism requires strong support both domestically and internationally, defense strong for the foreseeable future, domestic security remains a priority. Traditional strong areas of our economy (e. g. agriculture, mining, space, consumer durables will be impacted as length of war will require redirection of national resources or traditional exporting partners will reassess reliability of sources of supply). Scenario 3: Long War ( more than six months) - Defense, homeland security, security infrastructure dominant influences on the economy. Tourism seriously curtailed and due to economic stress fewer people relocating to Florida thereby impacting construction and service industries. All require state support. Although short, hope this helps. Bill Habermeyer

Subject:	RE: Dismantling Our State Library

Dear Brad:
Governor Bush passed on your thoughts to me.  I have been involved in
planning for the future management of the state library, museum, etc.  I can
assure you, it is not being dismantled!  Not even close.  In fact, our goal,
given my boss's interest in encouraging reading, is to make the collection
even more accessible to the public.  At the same time, the historically
important volumes will continue to get the same high quality archival
protection they deserve.

You must also recognize, the changes that are occurring now in terms of the
management of the library are not simply the result of the Governor having
his own idea about this.  It was the voters who elected to abolish an elected
Secretary of State.  That is what is necessitating the management changes
that are occurring now.

Regarding the parks....we are very proud of the volunteers we have in the
parks.  I am sorry you have found some that you believe to be "horrid."  That
has never been my experience.  Perhaps you will offer to volunteer yourself
in a park near you?

You should also know that we are not (and have never proposed) that
volunteers will take away the jobs of our park rangers.  That is a bad rumor.
In fact, the Governor has increased money available to state parks to hire
contractors to take over some of the maintenance work (i.e., cleaning
bathrooms, cutting the grass, painting, collecting entrance fees, etc.) that
has historically fallen on our rangers. This actually allows us to
"professionalize" our rangers -- allowing them to better focus on our 18
million visitors per year, and to better protect our natural and cultural
resources.

Thanks for writing.  I appreciate the opportunity to share some of the facts
with you.

Dear Governor Bush,

Well then please explain you plans! The Florida Historical Society and
many others are highly concerned about it. There is now an extensive
petition circulating to stop you plans.

Also, you might explain the reason for the horridly low quality
volunteers and RV-er couples running some of our state parks? How can
you cut the already low paid employees who care about the natural
history and are dedicated; replacing them with people with no real
committment or know-how? Saving money is simply not a good enough
answer. I have personally questioned some of these park workers and they
know next to nothing about the treasures they are watching over. I have
talked with many park rangers who fear losing their jobs and are being
told to attend training seminars for the volunteers they fear will
replace them. This idea of privitization will never be successful in
Florida. 

I'm sorry you feel "attacked", but being a public servant, perhaps you
should develop a thicker skin and get used to it. It comes with the
territory. Also, listening more to people you feel are attacking you
might teach you something. Many average people feel you are not in touch
with them nor in touch with Florida. Based on my knowledge as a native,
and in biology and environmental science, it is plain to me you have
much to learn. Perhaps you might try more balance
in your political idealism and approach; educate yourself more on
Florida issues, ecology and geology The almighty dollar should not be
the main concern.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
   Polk county schoolteacher, here!
 
   You are invited to a tree planting in Lakeland, Florida, on Friday, February 21st., at 2:30 P.M.
 
   St. Paul Lutheran School is planting a live oak tree to honor my wife and her life. The school is 5 minutes from the Lakeland Airport. The entire time from landing, to return flight, will take about 1 hour and 10 minutes, maximum. No public speeches, no press, just Florida citizen Jeb Bush attending as a private guest. I have 3 close friends of Jean's that I would like to introduce you to (and their young children), that's the extent of it! Your presence would help me a lot!
I know the young children at the school would realize the importance of her Christian love and sacrifice, if you got their attention by being present. I hope you can come!
 
    As I told you in my last E-mail, I'm going to be an advocate for early screening of Colon Cancer - it's the best way I can think of to honor Jean's struggles and tremendous bravery and courage.
 
   I know this is a very short notice to you! I apologize. If you can come, I'll be glad to pick you and any staff members up at the airport. I  have room  (in my boss' Navigator) for about 6 to eight people. (So, transportation can be taken care of!).
 
   Jean and I would be honored to have you!  We have both admired your tenacity as governor, your ability to work out as our state's #1 leader, and always look out for the best possible course for Florida's citizens. I am so glad that you and your brother are leading Florida and our great nation at this difficult time in history.
 
   Thanks for your encouraging E-mails!
 
 
Sincerely,

State of Florida Division of Retirement 
Cedars Executive Center 
2639 N. Monroe St., Bldg. C         
Tallahassee, FL 32399-1560

Dear Director Sjostrom:

    In my opinion and in the opinion of many others, the Final Order by 
former director, A.J. McMullian 111, violates my right to purchase overseas 
teaching service at 6% of salaries earned and violates my right to a pension 
of 2% for the years of Florida teaching service as a member of the Florida 
Teachers’ Retirement System from 1952 until 1963. 
    I did claim and purchase seven years of prior Florida service, but the 
Division of Retirement did not grant 2% per year as prior Teachers’ 
Retirement System service, but only gave it a 1.68% per year as though the 
service was rendered as prior Florida Retirement System service rendered 
after 1970.  Doug Cherry has for years in retirement workshops across Florida 
shown on the overhead projector, said in his presentation, and given in 
written handouts prepared by the Division of Retirement that Florida Teaching 
Service as a member of the Florida Teachers’ Retirement System is given a 2% 
yearly calculation.
    I understand that you can not lobby for a bill to allow the pension that 
I was promised by the Florida Teachers’ Retirement System in 1959, contracted 
by Florida Statutes through 1969, and actually protected by the enactment of 
the Florida Retirement System Law in 1970.  However, please do not block or 
oppose legislation to rectify an unjust decision and allow my pension 
increase to what it should have been before Mr. McMullian’s disastrous Final 
Agency Order.  By the way, I believe I will be the only retired teacher 
covered under a proposed amendment to Ch. 121 of the Florida Statutes.
        Sincerely yours,      Volusia County teacher 1985-1997 (FRS)

Govenor,

A few weeks ago, I was moved by the mobilization of men to support our
nation's interests.  But, I heard stories of families left behind,
living
just above the poverty line while trying to handle the challenges of
their
loved one.  (See attached).

So, we started to mobilize the local church community.  We have called
it
Operation Home Fires, keeping the home fires going.  So far, we have had
a
great response.

Briefly, here's our goal.  First to raise the financial support to be
able
to provide traditional community services to these families outside of
the
normal military channels.  Second, to mobilize the church community to
help
by providing education and a rallying point of contact.  After all, the
mission of the Christian Service Center is to do together what cannot be
done separately!

On March 4, 2003, Gen. Ron Harrison (ret.) will be helping us bring
attention to the needs of those left behind by keynoting our Conference
for
Church Leadership.  It would not be proper if I did not extend an
personal
invitation to you to join us.  This is an example of what Faith-based
Initiatives are all about - quick response to a need.  It may also be a
model that can be replicated all over Florida!

Can you join us?  Please reply, or, if you are interested, please have
one
of your staff contact me.  I've listed everything below.

Thanks for your ear...may God continue to bless you and your family,

Dear Senator Graham and Senator Nelson: 

I hereby sign this letter as a constituent, to kindly request and urge your utmost consideration to support and vote in favor of Miguel Estrada, a Hispanic American, nominated Judge by President George W. Bush, to the District of Columbia U.S. Federal Appeals Court. 

We trust in Mr. Estrada, not only because he is of Hispanic origin, but also a well qualified individual. He is a successful and humble Honduran immigrant, thanks to his hard work and dedication. 

To confirm Mr. Estrada, will mean to recognize and grant opportunities to minorities whom also contribute to the prosperity of our nation, enable reduction of considerable amount of backlog cases and a good beginning to make our Federal appeals court system a diverse one. 

Thanking you in advance, 

Sincerely, 

Signature              Name                   Address                                 Telephone

Dear Governor Bush:
You may be able to ignore my epistles calling for changes in the correctional system, however sooner or later we as parents, and voting citizens will get enough voices to speak out for the voiceless inmates that are being abused and oppressed in our Florida prisons. 

Prison is not a place that we expect people to have comfort, but we do believe that the issues of: corruption and abusive treatment by staff, inadequate food and clothing, lack of education, drug, and vocational programs to provide survival skills upon release, sub-minimal medical treatment, cannot continue to be covered up by DOC denial.  

We do expect that our prisons are not flooded with all varieties of illicit drugs and that only the inmate users, not the staff that brings the great quantities into prison, are punished.

Do you want me to back up what I am saying with facts and figures?  I can, and you know I can.

The voices of inmates are being muffled by the brutal retaliation of guards and malicious retribution of staff.  The grievance process is a sham and does not give inmates and legal rights. 

It has to stop!

Read on.

Hi Marlene,
 
Will enclose emails from friends that I received in regard to getting help for you and StarCoast Academy. As soon as I get more info I will forward it to you. I will do all that I can for this cause. Please call me for any assistance.

I read your very interesting article in last Sunday's paper and I would like to connect you to a friend of mine in Tampa.

Mothers find strength as children do time 
--------------------

By Doris Bloodsworth
Sentinel Staff Writer

February 9, 2003

Sherry Grace shudders when she recalls crawling on her hands and knees through her upscale Longwood home. Drug abuse and crime had a stranglehold on her sons Andre and Avery Grace, and every doorbell ring brought fear of another arrest.

"I would check to see if it was a police officer," said Sherry Grace, 49. "If it was, I would crawl through the house on my hands and knees to get to my boys' rooms to tell them to get under their beds and not to move. I knew we could not afford to bail them out again."

Many who knew Grace and her husband, Dr. Willie Grace Jr., during those years did not know about the family's problems. The Graces worked hard at keeping it that way.

Sherry Grace eventually found comfort in an unexpected place. While visiting her sons at the Orange County Jail, she found herself reaching out to other moms there. On Mother's Day 2001, she started Mothers of Incarcerated Sons.

Since then, the Orlando support group has spread to five states and has more than 255 members that include moms, grandmothers, dads and young men in "universities of learning," as Grace refers to prison.

On Feb. 25, Grace will take a film crew to Coleman federal prison in Sumter County to document a new initiative connecting business leaders with inmates being released.

"We are asking, 'Will you just take one?' " when they get out of prison, Grace said.

Grace's group is promising to screen the inmates and mentor them during the transition from prison to the workplace.

Publishers of Essence magazine were so impressed with Grace and her organization that they featured her along with Colin Powell and Maya Angelou in a recently released book, The 50 Most Inspiring African-Americans.

Essence editor Susan Taylor met Grace last summer while speaking in Orlando. Before her presentation, Taylor struck up a conversation with a young man who had been in jail. Taylor invited him to her conference, and Grace came forward to offer him and his family support.

The number of black men in jail or prison has grown fivefold in the past 20 years, according to a Justice Policy Institute study released last summer. The study by the Washington-based research agency reported there are more black men behind bars than are enrolled in colleges or universities.

To help the women who care about those men cope, Grace has inspirational meetings on the last Sunday of each month. Women young and old form a circle around a table filled with candles and baby pictures. Some are looking for strength to face a lifetime away from their children. Others, such as Deborah Casey, find a place to talk about their loss for the first time.

Casey said although her heart was broken over her son Robert Casey's 10-year sentence for armed robbery, she kept silent.

"My family didn't feel like I did about it," said Casey, an Orange County school-bus driver. "And ever since he was arrested, I couldn't tell anybody at work."

At the mothers' support group, Casey found understanding. Like the other moms, she doesn't make excuses for her son's actions. But his crime hasn't stopped her from caring.

"He was a good kid," she said of her 23-year-old son serving time in a Panhandle prison. "This is the first time he had been in trouble."

Like battle-weary soldiers, they are in this for the long haul. Some have seen their sons' sentences shortened. Others have won appeals or at least had their sons moved closer for visitation.

Grace looks to her own children for hope. Edmund, 21, and Angelina, 19, are in college and doing well. Son Andre Grace, 29, who could have faced a long prison sentence, has stopped using drugs and runs his own dental lab. He often travels with his mom to speak about the support group.

For Avery Grace, 27, the story has been sadder. He has been in and out of prison and mental-health institutions. His baby picture is at the center of every meeting. His is the first candle lighted.

"I know that God will heal Avery," Sherry Grace said.

While she waits for that miracle, Grace is busy planning more programs for her mothers' group.

Cecil Hollar, a former IBM executive and Mothers of Incarcerated Sons board member, says those successes are due to one thing.

"It's a mother's love," said Hollar, 56, of Gotha. "It's unconditional, and there are no boundaries or borders."

Palm Beach and Volusia Legislators:  Gov. Jeb Bush

    Please have the following inserted in  Florida Statute Chapter 121 in 
2002-3:     “”For all former members of the Teachers’ Retirement System, who 
lost membership because contributions were withdrawn or because Florida 
teaching was not resumed for five or more years before 1970 and who returned 
to teaching as a compulsory member of the Florida Retirement System, the cost 
for purchasing TRS out-of-state or federal service will be determined by 6% 
of salaries earned for the years of service at the time membership ceased.  
All rights and benefits under the Teachers’ Retirement System will be 
restored and pension will be calculated at 2% for each year of service. This 
right and benefit are retroactive to date of retirement and before the first 
retirement check was issued and cashed.  An application for such teaching 
service must be applied for to the Division of Retirement after June 1, 2003 
and adjusted payment will begin on July 31, 2003.”  
    In 1997, when Robert C. Heath retired from 22 years of teaching in Palm 
Beach and Volusia Counties, Mr. A.J. McMullian III denied ten years of full 
retirement credit, because of a Florida Retirement System enacted in 1970.  
McMullian, in a contrived informal hearing at the Division of Retirement 
Offices, refused teaching credit for teaching in Heidelberg American High 
School, which the Teachers’ Retirement System grants, and only allowed seven 
years of Palm Beach service at 1.68% instead of 2% per year, which is 
mandated under the Florida Teachers’ Retirement System.
Dr. Heath is appealing to the Florida Legislators and Gov. Bush to amend 
Florida Statutes, Chapter 121, to raise his short changed pension to the 
correct pension promised before and after 1970 and protected by Ch. 121 for 
Ch. 238 benefits.                   Respectfully yours,
            Robert C. Heath,  Member TRS 1952-1963, FRS 1985--1997

POLITICAL PULSE 
Retro rerun: It's that '70s amendment

By John Kennedy | Sentinel Staff Writer 
Posted February 16, 2003 



All in the family

U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat and brother of former President John Kennedy, has been among the leading critics of President Bush's social-service policies and cuts. A similar tale of the Kennedys vs. the Bushes was playing out in Florida last week.

Anthony Kennedy Shriver, son of 1972 Democratic presidential candidate Sargent Shriver and brother of NBC-TV correspondent Maria Shriver, went before a Florida Senate committee to tout the benefits of Best Buddies International, a program for the disabled that he founded.

The Miami-based nationwide mentoring program received a $750,000 grant last year from Florida, but Gov. Jeb Bush, brother of the president, has proposed slashing that to $550,000 this year, Shriver said.

Shriver created Best Buddies in 1989 while at Georgetown University. It has grown into a nonprofit agency with 40,000 volunteers and offices around the world. Its Florida operation is based in Orlando.

Shriver later played down any rift between the Kennedy clan and the Connecticut-bred Bushes.

"We've had our ups and downs with them, but overall we get along pretty well," Shriver said, noting that President Bush named Shriver's brother-in-law, film star and GOP contributor Arnold Schwarzenegger, to a presidential physical-fitness panel.

Dear Governor  Bush,

    Thank you for taking the  time to acknowledge my presence at the small 
business forum held by President Bush here in Jacksonville last Thursday.  
    Since I tend to disagree with many of you and your brother's policies, 
many in attendance may have been a little surprised to see me. 
    My reasoning for attending? Well, let's just say that over the years I 
have become much more interested in dialogue than criticism. A good friend of 
mine who just happens to be a Republican has helped me there. Not to mention 
what he has learned from me. Besides, who can turn down an invitation to see 
the President of the United States?
    To the point, I was disappointed to see that there were no BLACK business 
owners participating in the forum. I would have been interested in hearing 
their story as well.  
    As you probably already know, I serve on the Florida Black Business 
Investment Board where I try to champion the uniqueness of the struggles of 
black business owners. Trust me, they are different. I won't get into the 
specifics here because I know that your time is short. But just know that 
things aren't always as simple as they seem. I have my own ideas on how to 
raise the success level of black and other minority owned businesses but, 
I'll save that dialogue for another time or the importance of your interest 
level.

Thanks for your time,

Subject:	PANUPS: New Reports Find Pesticides in People

 
Hello Family and Friends:
 
Here is yet another in the long history of wakeup calls involving synthetic organic chemicals that are routinely and casually delivered into the soil, water, and air of our creation to kill what humans consider to be nuisance insects, plants, fungus, or other micro-organisms like nematodes (I call this sector of the organic chemical business the suicide branch, i.e., pesticides, herbicides, fungicides and nematocides).  These chemicals do not exist naturally anywhere in the soils, water, or air of planet earth, therefore, natural systems are not designed to deal with them other than to pass them along into the soils that grow our food, into the waters that we drink, and into the air that we breath.  It is very important to understand that when Man creates a new complex molecule in the laboratory and discovers that it is effective in killing an insect, a plant, a fungus, or a microorganism that has been determined to be a nuisance or is destructive to agricultural production, or real property, our worldly societies should not manufacture and sell these products until and unless they are absolutely and scientifically certain that natural organisms already existing in nature have the ability to rapidly and productively use these newly created chemical substrates as food thereby breaking them down into the same fundamental chemical elements with which they were created.  
 
Once these exotic molecules are incorporated into the very blood, tissues, and organs of our bodies, we have little or no understanding of whether and to what extent they interrupt the thousands of normal biochemical reactions and upon which our bodies depend for good health every single hour and day of our lives.  We also do not understand if these same chemicals alter or adversely affect the genetic material in our cells that many of us pass on to create our progeny.  Think about that!  Our nation has spent and is spending billions of dollars to organize an effort to destroy a pest in Iraq named Saddam Hussein based in large part over our concern that he will use chemical weaponry against this country, his neighbors, or his own people.  While this has only been occurring for a little over a decade, our leaders, our chemists, our companies, and the producers of our foodstuffs have collaborated, wittingly or unwittingly, to bring every man, woman, and child in this and other countries under a massive and sustained chemical attack since well before Rachel Carson wrote Silent Spring in 1962!  Many of you know this truth with certainty, but the irony of it is so deadly tragic.  
 
As I wrote this last paragraph, I reached up on my bookcase and brought down my weathered copy of Silent Spring.  I glanced at the forward to see that Stewart Udall, as Secretary of the Interior at the time, wrote, "A great woman has awakened the Nation by her forceful account of the dangers around us."  The Saturday Review commented by saying, "Silent Spring is a devastating attack on human carelessness, greed, and irresponsibility.  It should be read by every American who does not want it to be the epitaph of a world not very far beyond us in time."  Secretary Udall's observation was very relevant at the time, but our Nation went back to sleep allowing the carelessness, the greed, and the irresponsibility to continue into our tomorrows.  The clock is still ticking and we have no idea how much of our epitaph has already been written!

New Reports Find Pesticides in People

February 14, 2003

Dozens of pesticides and other chemicals are in the blood and urine of people in the United States, according to two reports released in late January.  Together, the two studies offer startling new evidence of the chemical body burden carried by the U.S. population.  The first study, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), tested thousands of people for 116 chemicals, 34 of them pesticides.  The CDC's Second National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals is a significant expansion from the first study released in 2001, which focused on nine pesticides and 27 chemicals in total. This year's
report includes evidence of the U.S. population's chemical body burden of three types of pesticides: organochlorines, organophosphorus compounds and  carbamates. CDC scientists also tested for a few widely used weed killers and other pesticides that don't fall into any of these categories.  Nineteen of 34 pesticides were detected in the blood or urine of test subjects.  
 
CDC highlights two specific pesticide-related findings in their report.  First, metabolites of the pesticide chlorpyrifos are nearly twice as high in children (age 6-11) than adults. Most home uses of chlorpyrifos (widely known by the Dow product name Dursban) were recently banned by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), but an estimated 10 million pounds of the pesticide continues to be used each year in agricultural production.  

The pesticide body burdens found in the new studies result from a variety of exposures.  Pesticide residues in food are a major source of exposure, as are  pesticides in drinking water. Farmworkers and people in communities and schools located near farms where pesticides are sprayed may inhale fumes from the applications or come in contact with residues of spray drift that have settled in their yards or homes.  And pesticides used in the home can be absorbed through skin contact, inhalation or accidental ingestion.  Reducing or eliminating pesticide use in the home and supporting organic agriculture are two concrete ways consumers can respond to the body burden news.  Not surprisingly, new evidence shows that children who eat more organic food have fewer chemicals in their bodies. (See PANUPS, January 31, 2003, http://www.panna.org/resources/panups/panup_20030131.dv.html.).  Supporting organic production will send a powerful message to farmers and will lead to falling demand for agricultural pesticides.  

CDC will be checking levels of these and additional chemicals every two years, and will make the full data set for both the first and second National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals available in mid-March.  PANNA plans to do further analysis on the pesticide body burden findings at that time.

I remember what you said to Dr. Michael Gannon at the UF Sesquicentennial about appreciating our rich history.  I made a brief reference to Pedro Menendez de Aviles (1519-74) in the note cards but wanted to send you a short quote from Dr. Gannon's History of Florida that describes the first Spain/Florida "trade mission" over 430 years ago.  

"Pedro Menendez de Aviles was the founder of Florida.  It was Menendez who on September 8, 1565, established Florida's and the country's first permanent European settlement.  La Florida was not seen by Menendez in the beginning as a battlefield.  Its conquest and settlement were undertaken as a commercial enterprise.  Menendez, an entrepreneur, aspired to be Florida's first great land developer, industrialist, and agribusinessman."

Governor, 

I was thinking about doing a column item about your birthday and thought 
I might be able to make it more interesting if you had a moment to 
answer a few terribly pressing questions. (If not, that's ok. I holler 
when it's crucial.) 

What could you do at 40 that you can't do at 50? 

What was your best gift? 

What was your best gift from a lobbyist? 

Are you dying your hair yet? 

When will you actually be "old"? 

Who are you going to name as your lt. gov? (Just testing.) 

Thanks. And happy belated birthday.

Dear Governor

I would like to take this moment to congratulate you on  the recent
gubernatorial reelection success.  Both you and your brother make me a
proud  American and Republican member.

 I would also like to thank you for your strong support for the State of
Israel , as very much like the United States,  it faces ongoing
terrorist threats.

As a  practicing orthopedic surgeon in Brevard County, I would like to
offer my assistance for any medical aspect or task force of early
responders on issues dealing with homeland security for the state of
Florida.

Please forward this offer of assistance to the appropriate individuals,
or alternatively, please indicate which Dept. I may contact to offer
assistance in this aspect.

Warmest regards,

Sir,
The Florida Board of Medicine disciplined two Florida physicians last weekend for internet prescribing of drugs based upon on-line questionnaires:
The Board previously disciplined another physician for similar conduct at the August 2002 Meeting:
 
Although the new Board Internet Prescribing Rule is not yet in effect, the Board has consistently held that such practice is inappropriate prescribing and/or practice below standard of care and failure to maintain adequate records in violation of Sections 458.3331(1)(q), (m), and (t), F.S.
 
I've been advised that the Department's Investigative Services Office is currently working with law enforcement agencies,  including DEA, to investigate internet prescribing activities. DEA just this week addressed the Department's Investigators Conference in Orlando regarding the scope of the issue and the Canadian Pharmacy Issue
 
I am working with staff, the board of Pharmacists and the board of Medicine to see what else we can do. 
We are only just beginning, I'll will of course keep you posted.

Sir, I know you are presently in Spain promoting the great State of Florida. However, I wanted you to know that I gave my brother Phil a copy of your response to my email. He and his wife Debie and four childrenn (Hanna, Andrew, Graceann and Daniel) were thrilled to have met you and to hear how you appreciated meeting them. They are a family that helps make Florida and our country strong. They also appreciate your commitment to families. Phil is my youngest brother and was four years old when we immigrated to the United States in 1964 from Nova Scotia, Canada. 
 
Thanks for your leadership

P.S. Although you probably don't open attachments (for good reasons), in case you do, I have attached a copy of a speech I gave at the naturalization ceremony in Tallahassee on January 17, 2003, when 40 immigrants became U.S. citizens. It was an emotional experience for an immigrant like me.

Dear Sir,

Permit me to please task your patience to go through this proposal.  I use the 
word patience because you may have received in 
the past certain proposals which you may be inclined to consider similar to 
this 
particular one.  But certainly, this is unique 
because we are not asking you to become `some contractor.´ Of a contract  which 
you did not execute. 
In his Independence Anniversary Speech on October 1st,2002 our President 
directed the immediate setting up of a task force to 
release Mohammed Abacha (the detained son of late Abacha) following the plea of 
eminent northern elders and the decision of 
the Appeal Court so to do.  This task Force is to monitor the return to 
Nigerian 
Treasury more of Nigeria money earlier looted by 
late President Abacha and kept under the control of Mohammed himself.

Fortunately I was made the Secretary General of this Task force.  And 
immediately on resumption, we have discussed and 
agreed with Mohammed himself to keep away and divert the sum of U$25Million 
which is well secured abroad.  In the light of 
this, we do appeal to you to consider helping us to receive this amount into 
any 
of your foreign accounts.There are no strings 
attached and we will make all the necessary arrangements to ensure that the 
fund 
is transferred into your chosen account.

All we would require is the ailed account what the money to be transferred and 
we  get this accomplished within a short time.

Please email ASAP and in case you need any further clarification

Yours truly,

MR.Wilson Ijeh

Subject:	prison rape

Dear Dr. Hall:
The unprofessional comment that the psychologist made to Daymond reflects the callus indifference that DOC staff have towards prison rape.  Statistics show that between 9% to 27% of all inmates are raped in prison, and that juveniles incarcerated with adults are five times more likely to be victimized.

Daymond has tried to protect himself from unwanted sexual advances by living in an open dorm.  In CM he had no choice of a cellmate, he was locked in a cell with a sexual predator that made a sexual assault on him in the middle of the night, he first verbally warned the person to stop, and then he defended himself when he did not.

His broken hand was not adequately attended, and the damage done has been made inoperable by the neglect of the medical department. 

To add personal insult from a psychologist asking Daymond "just how it felt to beat up someone" reflects the callus indifference to this very serious prison problem of being raped.  

I believe she would feel this comment to be inappropriate and insensitive had she been the one that had been rudely awaken, sexually accosted, and she had broken her hand, in self defense.  Would you?  Isn't that kind of like asking a woman after she had been raped, if she thought it was fun? What do you think?

Inmates know that guards just laugh if the subject of having someone moved for ones protection is suggested.  It is naive of any prison personnel to feel that any inmate has any real means of gaining security through the aid of prison staff asking to have his cellmate moved.  Prison rape is a problem that generally goes undisclosed, because of the overall embarrassment, few are reported.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
   Polk county schoolteacher, here!
 
   You are invited to a tree planting in Lakeland, Florida, on Friday, February 21st., at 2:30 P.M.
 
   St. Paul Lutheran School is planting a live oak tree to honor my wife and her life. The school is 5 minutes from the Lakeland Airport. The entire time from landing, to return flight, will take about 1 hour and 10 minutes, maximum. No public speeches, no press, just Florida citizen Jeb Bush attending as a private guest. I have several close friends of Jean's that I would like to introduce you to (and their young children), that's the extent of it! Your presence would help me a lot!
I know the young children at the school would realize the importance of her Christian love and sacrifice, if you got their attention by being present. I hope you can come!
 
    As I told you in my last E-mail, I'm going to be an advocate for early screening of Colon Cancer - it's the best way I can think of to honor Jean's struggles and tremendous bravery and courage.
 
   I know this is a very short notice to you!  I apologize. If you can come, I'll be glad to pick you and any staff members up at the airport. I  have room  (in my boss' Navigator) for about 6 to eight people. (So, transportation can be taken care of!).
 
   Jean and I would be honored to have you!  We have both admired your tenacity as governor, your ability to work out as our state's #1 leader, and always look out for the best possible course for Florida's citizens. I am so glad that you and your brother are leading Florida and our great nation at this difficult time in history.
 
   Thanks for your encouraging E-mails!

Subject: Transfer of Mental Health and Substance Abuse to Health Dept.


Governor Bush, you and President Bush were at Mayport this week.
My husband has left that Pier, and others, so many times, in his twenty-three years of service. On the USS Saratoga, the last year of the Vietnam War, he worked on the flight deck, with the catapults.
I flew to Hong Kong to join him, for his week of R&R. He was there nine months and when the war ended. I could see the flames and smell the fumes in the distance from the Hong Kong Hilton. I saw the Great Wall of China, which in my mind symbolized communism everywhere. That brings the real meaning of freedom, front and center, and how fortunate we are to live in this country.
He was also involved in the Cuban Crisis.
Our family knows first hand about sacrifices for our country and our freedom. We agree with our President, like the Cuban Crisis, this too, must be done, sooner rather than later.

As you know I exercise often, one of the rights, my husband and I, have earned by our years of service to our country. Freedom to be heard.
I have written many times concerning transferring ADM from DCF to a separate Division of Mental Health and Substance Abuse, under the umbrella of the Health Department. With a Psychiatrist in charge of Administration, and a funding stream designated specifically for this division. The Psychiatrist having full authority and responsibility for accountability for treatment outcomes and funds utilized.

I would like a reply, have you considered the many positive aspects of clients actually recovering, with the right treatment and medications. To the point, they can have a life instead of merely existing. A bonus to the state, less clients on public assistance, more on tax rolls instead.

         Prayers, Jo

victims rights, or the lack thereof, at the local level.  Would you please 
ask your staff to schedule an appointment?  I can be reached at

Governor

We don't know who to turn to, no one seems to want to help or care. 
We
adopted 2 children many years ago.  As of last January 2002 there was
thousands of back support owed.  Since the adoption we have been to
court many times but the mother or father have never showed up.  When
we
call about developments of finding the mother they tell us, if we get
new evidence let them know.  I feel that the system has worked for
them.
The father who we know where he is at, has never been served a summons
to appear in court or to pay what we feel he owes.  They tell us it
has
been to long and now he will go Scott free and never pay anything.  He
hid out, and now he is off the hook is this justice?  For years our
other family members have hid him not telling us where he is at now
that
they will not touch him they tell us.  The mother has put us through
so
much at one time the State threaten to have a 9 month old and a 2 year
old arrested because the state was paying 2 checks out, one to the
mother and one to us.  They wanted us to repay the money even though
we
had custody.  That took 6 months to straighten out.  Cant we find her
by
her SS number, or through Federal means like filling a tax return?  We
have also told the state that she has always gone by her married name
they don't ever want to hear that and never searched through that
means.
What do we do?  I know you are busy but we know what your value is on
family and respect you for that.  We can be reached at 727-327-3509
just
for your information.  Hope your daughter is doing well, We have just
now put our own oldest son in operation par at 24 we also hope that
this
is the way to recover.  God Bless you and your Family.

	Today I write to you from Madrid, Spain.  I am here  along with 80 business leaders from Florida participating in a trade mission securing more commerce and economic opportunity for our state. Florida already holds an enviable strategic position in the global economy, but we must do all we can to facilitate even more international trade.  

	Among my top priorities as Governor continues to be making sure our economy is strong, so that Florida continues to be a  hopeful place where the entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well.   I wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for coming to Dagher Printing last Thursday for President Bush's Small Business Forum.  I am very proud of my brother and his focus on the nations economy.  Over half the jobs in America are created by small businesses and The President understands the need to stimulate that aspect of our economy.  His plan includes tax rate reductions,  increasing the capital expenditure deduction, and establishing a depreciation bonus for qualified capital investments by businesses.  It is my hope that as the state legislature convenes, Florida can partner with the Federal Government once again to receive maximum benefit.  Additionally in Florida we must reform worker's compensation. 

	As a business person, I know you understand the impact these issues will have on our state and I ask you to spread the word.

	Thank you

Everglades Plan to Raze 77 Homes
Compromise Measure to Revive Park After 14-Year Delay

   By Michael Grunwald
         Staff Writer

   Washington Post

   Monday, February 17, 2003; Page A02

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A18572-2003Feb16.html

MIAMI, Feb. 16 -- Congress has approved a plan to destroy 77 homes at the edge of Everglades National Park, jump-starting efforts to restore
flows to the ailing River of Grass after 14 years of delay.

The compromise measure to buy out the most flood-prone portion of what is known as the 8.5 Square Mile Area, a tight-knit Cuban American
neighborhood of mango groves and horse pastures, was supported by President Bush and Gov. Jeb Bush (R), as well as by regulators and
environmentalists. Tucked into last week's $397 billion budget bill, it would revive the Modified Water Deliveries Project of 1989, a long-stalled plan
to rehydrate the parched eastern side of the park.

The revival of "Mod Waters" would also help the much larger $8.4 billion Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, the most ambitious
environmental project in history. The law authorizing the overall Everglades restoration in 2000 specified that several key elements could not
proceed until Mod Waters is complete.

"The logjam is broken," said Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), the original sponsor of Mod Waters as well as the new measure to get it moving. Sen.
George Voinovich (R-Ohio) and Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr. (R-Fla.) also helped push the buyout, overcoming property-rights opposition from Sen.
James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) and Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska).

Environmentalists had pushed for a buyout of the entire 8.5 Square Mile Area, but most were happy with the compromise, which is to buy out 44
percent of the land and 12 percent of the homes. The residents of the area, however, were furious, even though their congressman, Rep. Mario
Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.), attached language requiring the Army Corps of Engineers to offer owners of the 77 affected homes land elsewhere in the
neighborhood.

Today, the residents held a protest rally in Miami's Little Havana neighborhood, accusing Jeb Bush of turning his back on Cuban American
supporters. They carried signs, in English and Spanish, vowing: We will not sell.

"This is a shameful travesty," said Alice Pena, president of the local homeowners group. "We're going to keep fighting."

The one bright side, Pena said, was the language assuring the residents a chance to stay in the 8.5 Square Mile Area, even though it is now
slated to become a 4.5 square-mile area. Many residents had suggested that the compromise plan was part of a government conspiracy to ease
them out of the neighborhood, but Pena said the new language suggests that the neighborhood is here to stay.

"It's a bit of a relief," she said. "We're very disappointed, though. We live in America. We're supposed to have rights."

The original Mod Waters plan would have protected the entire neighborhood, but park officials warned that it would also drain 30,000 acres of
Everglades wetlands, defeating the purpose of the plan. The compromise, they say, will allow true restoration.

Gov. Bush

Quote by the St. Pete Times:02/17/2003

Bush will funnel $1.4-billion to nonprofit minority organizations -- many of which are black churches -- in the current fiscal year. And one day in 2001, without fanfare, he removed the banner bearing the Confederate flag from the state Capitol. 

"We did it because it was the right thing to do, and I'll continue to do that," Bush said. 

I believe that a great deal of your best efforts are not known. I personally am familiar with your contributions to African American Communities, especially with faith base organizations.  (DJJ presently funds about $1.6 mil)  Even if you are modest its still a story that needs to be articulated publicly in an effort to provide a balance.  P. S. Pastor Barnes wanted me to tell you “thank you” I was able to assist him.

Take care,

Subject:	EMS/Ocean Lifeguard Curriculum at PJC

Dear Mr. Moore,
 
I spoke to Sandy Hartley of your ParaMedic program this morning telling her of our exciting news regarding the letter of endorsement and support from the Florida Beach Patrol Chiefs Association for establishing a curriculum at Pensacola Junior College for "Aquatic Rescue Specialist" and their suggestion that a similar curriculum be considered for UWF.  
 
The letter is the result of the support of Mike McKenna, a USLA officer who is Advisor for the Florida Beach Patrol Chiefs Association and the First Chair for Public Education of the United States Lifesaving Association.
 
I am faxing you a copy of that letter to you at 484-2364.  Mr. Moore, I am so excited about this!  If there is ANYTHING I can do to facilitate this, you have but to ask.  I will even be happy to make a financial contribution to help with the organizational costs should that be necessary.  We have been pursuing this goal for over four years now.  I will go anywhere any time to advance this project.
 
Enclosed below are a couple of emails that you may find relevant, and I have also included some links for you too.
 
The officers of the USLA may be found at http://www.usla.org/About/national.shtml#officers
These people have been great and Chris Brewster will set up the liaison with Miramar college in California.
 
I would like to share with you a bit of my vision regarding the proposed curriculum and offer a few suggestions, and some encouragement.
 
There is a paradigm shift taking place nationally that is moving the perspective of Ocean Lifesaving from the realm of RECREATION to that of EMS.  Ocean Lifesavers are EMS personnel who arrive at the victim by running, swimming, or by watercraft in open water rather than by ambulance.  Just as an ambulance borne EMS specialist needs to understand defensive driving, the Openwater Lifesaver needs to understand their surroundings and "traffic" as well.  Thus I submit that the Ocean Lifesaver should have a core curriculum of:

*	EMT (minimal) or Paramedic (better) Training and Certification
*	USLA Openwater/Ocean Lifesaving Techniques and Certification

AND some basic or at least minimal exposure to:

*	Oceanography
*	Meteorology
*	Marine Biology

Perhaps it would be best to see a tiered program (Yeah, I know I am dreaming) of:

1.	A Certification program (USLA Ocean Life Saving Certification plus EMT Certification) 
2.	Associate Degree of Paramedic, plus USLA Certification, with some Oceanography, Metrology, and Marine Biology
3.	Baccalaureate Degree in Public Health, Paramedic, plus USLA Certification, with more Oceanography, Metrology, and Marine Biology

Of course, what kind of interest could we expect in such programs is the big question.  I think when Chris Brewster introduces you to Miramar College, their program success will give you a better indication than I ever could.  I believe the Miramar program is oriented mainly toward USLA Certification, and that a PJC program oriented toward EMS with the addition of USAL Certification would be a huge advance in the curriculum.  With the support of the Florida Beach Patrol Chief's Association, and perhaps the Office of Tourism and Economic Development, and the media, you will likely draw students from quite a distance.  I think once the word gets out, you will be amazed at the interest you will get!  Such a curriculum will speak well for the entire state of Florida.
 
I know when I went to the Red Cross National Aquatic School in Hattiesburg (as did Dottie Whitcomb) it was a much-sought curriculum where both lifesaving and EMS (First Aid) were taught.  I went for four summers on a special waiver (age) by the Regional Director of the American Red Cross.  Representing Louisiana, I attended with head life guards from all of the large Florida Beaches, and from New Jersey, Maryland, So. Carolina, Georgia, and Texas.  That school does not now exist to my knowledge, however the need is even greater.  When I went, we had four, two or three week sessions per summer with about 15 or 20 people in each session.  That was in 1959!  Such a curriculum would be THE ONLY ONE in the eastern US to my knowledge.  Pensacola is IDEALLY situated for it, and what better location?  
 
Although I certainly cannot speak for him, I think we might be able to get the Governor's Office to assist in promoting the curriculum.  Jeb Bush was a friend to my son, and has been aware for some time of our efforts to design and promote this curriculum.  I know he is a strong supporter of PJC and Jr. colleges at large in Florida.  It is certainly worth asking when the time is right.
 
I might also suggest and have referred to you an acquaintance, Mr. Bill Soltz.  Mr. Soltz is an experienced and mature life saver who has worked tirelessly to help both the Aquatic Rescue Specialist education project, and to advance beach safety on Santa Rosa Island Beaches.  I must admit that I am hoping to be able to ask Bill to accept a position as Chief of the Santa Rosa Island Beach Patrol when it is fully formed within the next two years.  In the mean time, I think he would be a valuable asset to assist you in formulating your curriculum.  If I can assist, please do not hesitate to ask.
 
Bill Soltz credentials are impressive, and include education and experience in Oceanography, as well as Ocean Life Saving and USLA Certification, and being a training instructor.  He is a most impressive fellow, well directed, well connected, and dedicated to this project.
 
I have suggested to Bill that he contact you and make an introduction, to assist you in any way possible.  I would like to buy both you and Bill Soltz lunch soon.  I have posted copies to long-term supporters of this project to assist us in keeping up to date on this project.  I hope you don't mind.  You may reach me at any of the numbers or addresses below.

The purpose of this email is to introduce those who share interest in this cause to each other, and distribute the email addresses of those dedicated persons who have the vision to see the need for an EMS Based Beach Patrol, A Beach Patrol that is a 501-C3 (Non-Profit) that can receive funding from both public and private sources (in cash and in-kind), A Beach Patrol that can serve both public and private beaches without burdening local government, and A Beach Patrol that is driven by Mission, not by politics.  Also, a Beach Patrol that is "fed" quality people by a Junior College curriculum similar to one the USLA certifies at Miramar College in California http://www.miramar.sdccd.cc.ca.us/ , but with the added aspect of Paramedic Certification to produce a true EMS Certified Paramedic/Ocean Lifeguard.  Chris Brewster bcb@compuserve.com , National Certification Officer,  during his visit to Pensacola http://www.wear3.com/news/Stories/august/0821/lifesaverspbeach.htm (and) http://www.pbrla.com/news_08302a.html has already offered to arrange the liaisons with Miramar for Sandra Hartley who heads the Paramedic Program at Pensacola Junior College.
 
The interest in such an educational program is very high on a state, national and international basis.  We have ALL of the elements here in Pensacola to launch such a curriculum.  I will support this effort with time, voice, and money; any time, any where.  
 
I am pleased to announce that the Santa Rosa Island Beach Patrol, Inc. has been incorporated as a Florida not-for-profit corporation.  I am now working with my CPA and attorney to structure the budget, Federal Non-Profit status, By-Laws, Board of Directors, etc.  I would like to ask you to support me in this great step and huge effort necessary to create this vehicle.
 
It is not my intention to confront the Santa Rosa Island Authority(!) over jurisdiction over the beach.  They are only able to provide coverage over a very small portion of the beach as it is, and no plans or method of which I am aware, to extend protection to the hotels and condo's or private property.  
 
I expect 1 to 3 years of organizational and preparatory work before the SRIBP will be in a position to assume responsibilities.  I do believe that there will be a NEED by hotels and condo's on the island for Beach Protection services by that time, if not before.  My desire is to make very sure that things are done correctly, accurately, and are well planned and organized to continue in perpetuity guaranteed by an endowment.  I submit that there will be beaches and people who both will need protecting long after all of us are gone.  The organization of the SRIBP will provide a vehicle to take beach safety into the future in ways not now envisioned or currently practiced.  A Public/Private Consortium is the best vehicle.  Such PPC's are being used in Canada for SAR and Beach Safety.  The PPC offers the ability to accept both public and private funding, and serve both public and private beaches under both public and private contracts.
 
I encourage each of you to stay in touch with me and each other.  Ask of me anything, if it will contribute to making our beaches more safe.  I thank you for all of your encouragement and support.
 
I remain,
My Son's Proud Father -
 
Jack Moran

February 17, 2003

Senators and Representatives:

    As legislators of Volusia and Palm Beach Counties, in which I completed 
22 years of my Florida teaching career, please amend Ch. 121 to correct my 
earned pension. 
    “”For all former members of the Teachers’ Retirement System, who lost 
membership because contributions were withdrawn or because Florida teaching 
was not resumed for five or more years before 1970 and who returned to teach 
ten years as compulsory members of the Florida Retirement System, the cost 
for purchasing out-of-state or federal service will be determined by 6% of 
salaries earned for the years of service at the time membership ceased.  All 
rights and benefits under the Teachers’ Retirement System will be restored 
and pension will be calculated at 2% for each year of service. This right and 
benefit are retroactive to date of retirement and before the first retirement 
check was issued and cashed.  An application for such teaching service must 
be applied for to the Division of Retirement after June 1, 2002 and adjusted 
payment will begin on July 31, 2003.”
    Since July 1, 1997, the Division of Retirement has cheated me, violated 
my trust in Florida laws, has paid me an inferior, unjust pension, and has 
refused to reconsider raising my pension to what it should legally be.  The 
Division has caused me undue stress, trouble, worry, loss of sleep, court 
action, and efforts to have the laws obeyed as promised in 1963, 1969, 1970, 
1975, and 1995, and efforts to amend Chapter 121, in order to grant all ten 
years of teaching with a Florida Teaching Certificate in the Florida 
Teachers’ Retirement System at 2% for each year of service.
    Please work to amend the Florida Statutes for me.  Ch. 121 can be amended!

Subject:	CINS / FINS Programs

Dear Sir:

I strongly urge you to continue funding for the CINS/FINS program in the
proposed Florida Senate/House budget for 2003-2004. Certainly in these
times of tough budget decisions I can understand a need for conservation,
however, it is difficult to understand why quality programs are being cut
or drastically reduced. As a school social worker in Pasco County, the
CINS/FINS program is a vital part of our community and school resources.
Our CINS/FINS staff work with hundreds of 'at risk' youth and their
families. I cannot imagine what would happen to some of these children if
they were not afforded the quality services that CINS/FINS provides.
Florida's children continue to need services to help them stay in school
and meet success in the community and school environment. The CINS/FINS
program has demonstrated that it can assist our youth in becoming
responsible, productive citizens. I believe that continued funding of this
program is imperative to the success of our future generations.

Sincerely,

Maria Fontaine, LCSW
School Social Worker

Subject:	new procedures for post secondary education approval

Dear Barbara:
I hear there is a new regulation that the Warden has to approve all post secondary courses.  Is there more to this new regulation than just that?  I have approvals and courses that are in the process, and I am getting pretty discouraged at materials getting sent back to Specialty Books, after they have been approved.  

It must get really discouraging for inmates when they finally have an academic opportunity that is within their reach, only for it to be delayed another month!

Is the Warden being asked to approve the courses because there are so many educational departments that are understaffed?  I hope I'm wrong about this being another way of denying inmates additional academic options.  Education just keeps being placed further on the back burner.  Pretty soon the DOC Educational department just might as well turn off the pilot light.

You would think with as many students that StarCoast-Academy is presently successfully serving, and at our own expense, that the DOC would want to try hard to work out the methods that would both satisfy the institution's security needs, and encourage this opportunity for the incarcerated.

I most certainly hope that requiring inmates to gain approval from individual institution's Warden will not bottle neck the process.  I think this is going to be a disaster if each Warden has their own set of procedures, and there isn't any standardization of forms and requirements. 

I would like some help with understanding the new procedures.

>Dear Governor Bush,

>I recently sent you an email concerning the plight of our 50 year old family Sawmill in Milligan, Florida.  Your office responded with a rapid response team to assist our employees with their unemployment.  We are trying everything we can to reopen and put our employees back to work.  Mary Helen arranged a meeting with various agencies that could possibly offer any assistance to us.  I appreciate the efforts from both departments.  There are several beneficial things that arose from that meeting.

There are several sawmill owners, timber dealers, and land owners across the state of Florida that would like to meet with you to explain the plight of our industry. We are willing to meet at a location and time of your choice.  We simply want to explain our situation and find out where we fit into your economic stimulus plan for our state.  I have attempted to obtain a meeting with your scheduler, Tara, only to be sent a letter of denial.  Congressman Miller’s office has also contacted her on my behalf to be refused as well.  Please consider this request to meet with our group.
>
>We all generate revenue in the state of Florida and need your support.  There are very few mills left in Florida and without them the land owner has no place to sell his timber.  Many forest land owners have owned land for years and have planted trees with their retirement in mind.  My grandfather planted over 2,500 acres of timber land which he passed down to his children.  They have cut part of the timber for their retirement and have replanted the trees to grow for our retirement.  Without a place to sell our timber, our retirement won’t exist.  The housing industry will suffer with the continued closure of sawmills in the US and in our State.  Without the US lumber, the cost of lumber will rise significantly.  By the housing industries own data roughly 2.5% of the cost of a new home is wood.  While that is a small amount, without the US lumber the cost of that 2.5% would likely sky rocket.
>
>Our personal community has been affected in more ways than I imagined due to our closure.  The largest timber dealer in our area has cut his logging crews by one half (these men are not eligible for unemployment since they are contract workers) and they are having to haul their logs out of state to Eufaula or Mobile, Alabama.  The result is a much lower price for the timber land owner.  The local chicken farmers and horse stable owners do not have an outlet for shavings since our closure, some were already driving as far as 90 miles to our mill.  Now they must travel farther.  The local nurseries have lost their outlet for bark as well as the individual landscaper.  For our community the impact has been far more than 40 people out of work.  I do not want to see this repeated with the rest of the mills and communities in the state.>

Dear Governor: Please see the story below on the dispersal of historical artificats and loss of staff in the Historical Preservation Departments and Museums. Surely there must be another way to handle this. I know you are not a native Floridian, but  still, you should show a little respect to your adopted state and its history. Last year, you de-funded the Florida Folk Festival on its 50th anniversary. Thank God Floridians rallied to save the Festival and their history. Floridians care about their history and their state's unique cultural and natural heritage.  We will hold your administration accountable.

TALLAHASSEE - Historians and others who fear losing control of artifacts and museum collections are scrambling this week to forestall a proposal that will change the way the state manages its cultural and historic resources. If Gov. Jeb Bush gets his way, half of the Florida state library's 1 million volumes will need a new home. At the same time, a 12,000-year-old mastodon skeleton nicknamed ``Herman,'' a silver crucifix from a Spanish shipwreck and 44,000 other items in the Museum of Florida History will get a new caretaker: the state park service. Critics raise their eyebrows at that match, worrying that the museum's staff will be replaced by park service employees and the collection will be moved from the R.A. Gray Building in downtown Tallahassee, which also houses the state library. They say Bush's proposed merger of the Department of Community Affairs and Department of State into a new Department of State and Community Partnerships also will gut, reorganize or relocate the Bureau of Historic Preservation and Department of Archives, among other agencies. No one can say for sure what the end result will be, but the state's historical community has become increasingly alarmed in recent weeks over the possibilities. Opponents have begun petitions. And the Florida Historical Commission scheduled an unprecedented special session in Tallahassee today to map out a plan of action. Staffing Concerns Robert Austin, president of the Florida Archaeological Council, is among those who have launched an e-mail blitz critical of the proposals. He says they are Bush's way of finding money to help pay for Amendment 9, the constitutional amendment to reduce class sizes. Voters passed the measure, which Bush opposed, in November. Austin and Nick Wynne, executive director of the Florida Historical Society, say most of what they believe will happen is based on discussions with state employees and private- sector people who work with them, rather than on item-specific budget proposals from Bush. ``We've heard the current [museum] staff would not have jobs,'' Austin said. He said public exhibits would be just some of the casualties. ``The Bureau of Archaeological Research and its 41 positions would go to [the Department of Environmental Protection], and there's some logic to that, but DEP may take the positions and not the [archaeologists], and therefore it might not be adequately administered.'' The Bureau of Historic Preservation's responsibilities include surveying and reviewing sites of proposed projects to see if there are archaeological resources there. History May Be Lost Austin worries that Floridians could lose valuable pieces of the state's history. He also voiced concerns that Bush's plan could cost private archaeological companies state contracts. And developers whose property may include archaeological artifacts could face long delays before getting approval or denial of their projects, Austin said. Wynne said he, too, fears that resources in the library and museum will disappear into agencies that have little or no expertise to deal with them. ``There's a great deal of apprehension this [library] collection that took 150 years to build will be no more.'' Interim Secretary of State Ken Detzner dismissed concern the museum and archives were heading to new quarters. ``There's never been any discussion about eliminating them, and there's no thought to moving either out of the R.A. Gray Building,'' said Detzner, who is scheduled to leave office Feb. 26 when Bush appointee Glenda Hood, the outgoing Orlando mayor, takes the post. ``Forty-four of the current positions at the museum are being transferred to DEP and [people who are concerned about the museum's future] should lobby DEP to retain those people, as we are,'' Detzner said. However, at least 500,000 volumes in the library will need to be moved somewhere, he said. Finding A New Home Florida State University, earlier proposed for the new home, is no longer in the picture, reportedly because money to house and maintain the collection isn't part of the deal. Detzner said there are other possibilities but he won't discuss them during negotiations. ``The governor had a tough budget year with Amendment 9 and the bullet train, and he had to make some tough choices,'' Detzner said. ``The governor challenged us to come up with a solution for the 500,000 volumes in the circulating collection - those that are available to be checked out. ``We're very optimistic we will place them.'' There has been speculation that Nova Southeastern University, a private institution in Fort Lauderdale, is the front- runner. Officials there could not be reached for comment. Dale Canelas, director of the University of Florida's libraries, said she has heard talk of Nova getting the volumes. ``They have a new building and a small collection,'' she said. ``But they must be asking, `Where's the money?' '' Meanwhile, there are strategy and information sessions planned for this week, including a special meeting today of the Florida Historical Commission in Tallahassee and a meeting Wednesday in Cocoa of the Florida Historical Society. The society has created a Web site, www.floridahistory.info/ petition, to collect electronic signatures for a petition about the feared library closing.

Subject:	Help a teacher!

Dear Governor Bush,
	I know you are a very busy man and receive email from more people
than you could ever answer.  I have never before felt strongly enough about
an issue to contact you.  I am a 5th grade teacher in Navarre.  I have
several children in my class that have financial problems and take advantage
of the free/reduced lunch program.  One student in particular stands out in
my mind.  This is his first year in Florida public schools.  He came to us
from an inner city Chicago school.  He is almost thirteen and still in 5th
grade.  He has been retained twice and no one ever bothered to help figure
out why he still has not improved or begun to catch up.  After a short time
with this student I began the referral process to investigate reasons why he
is below grade level and, despite hard work and determination, doesn't seem
to be making any academic gains.  Through the referral process, I discovered
that he has very poor vision.  His parents struggle financially and could
not save enough to get him his much needed glasses.  Through the VisionQuest
program, he received a free eye exam and a free pair of glasses.  He is
making progress, although slow, and turns all of his assignments
in.......because he can see what he's doing.  No, he doesn't have an A
average, but he tries now, and I can't catch him up unless he gives me 100%.
He is doing that now.
	I teach in Santa Rosa County, always one of the top in the state
when it comes to quality of education.  This year our test scores placed us
in the #1 slot.  The reason we continue to excel is because we meet the
needs of every student to give them many ways to succeed.  The VisionQuest
program did this for one student in my class, as well as thousands of others
around the state.  I understand that your proposed state budget would
eliminate this program and that Senator Pruitt would like to pass your
budget as it now stands.  I have a very rewarding/frustrating job.  I have
to do the best I can for each of my students, regardless of their
background, home life, financial status, etc.  Often teachers feel that no
one truly understands how we feel down in the trenches and that our most
precious natural resource, sometimes seems treated deserving only of the
leftovers or what can be spared.  Well, this program cannot and should not
be spared.  This is not a program that can be sacrificed.  I understand the
need for cutting back, but I say to you, it should not happen here.  Take
something else away, cut another program, but do not cut this one out.  It
may not seem like a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but it's the
only tool that some kids have to rely on to succeed in school.  I know you
must read a million of these type of emails, but this is a first for me.  I
have never before written a letter to any elected official explaining my
feelings on an issue.  It's important to many of our children and I truly
don't think we can afford to sacrifice even one child's chance to succeed in
school, let alone 15,000.  I hope you will reconsider your current budget
plans and save this program from being eliminated.  Thank you for your time.

Jeb,

The brief does not compare the two systems.  I do believe that we have a good system in Florida and will say so if asked.  

The corporations have not taken a position on the specifics of the University's admission plans because they are not in a position to opine on the efficacy or constitutionality of any particular plan.  Instead corporations' brief focuses on what is within their realm of experience:  that individuals educated in a diverse environment are more likely to succeed in today's global marketplace.

I wanted to give you a heads up that my company, Sterling Financial, has

of the admissions policy at the University of Michigan. 
This group of companies includes American Express, Boeing, Coca-Cola, 
General Electric, Intel, Microsoft, and Proctor & Gamble, among others, and 
argues that the pursuit of diversity in higher education is a compelling 
state interest because it prepares all students to succeed in and enhance

Dear Mr. Bush esq.

    I currently work in the St.Lucie County School system and my job is to test the children’s eyes. It has been such a struggle for parents / guardians to have a child’s eyes re-tested by a Doctor.  With life's constant demands, vision is at the bottom of our parents lists. Some are unable to afford the eyeglasses. I have seen first hand the reaction on a child’s face after receiving a pair of eyeglasses from VisionQuest and actually being able to read an entire book because they can now see the letters.

    On behalf of all the young children in the State Of Florida

would you please consider to save the VisionQuest program.

Jeb,

Frank died Friday, February 14
his body was found down at the pond,
there was not an autopsy, it was
determined to be a heart attack.

His funeral is Wednesday, February 19
9 a.m. viewing
10 a.m. service
followed by a military burial here in
Wausau.

I know you may not be able to attend but
just wanted you to know.  The friends and
family responses have been unbelieveable!!

Everybody loved Frank!  There is even a
Letter to the Editor on the chipleybugle.com
it was fantastic!!

Hope you all are doing well, it will take time
but with God's grace I will make it!!
Paul and Kelly are taking hard, living all over
the country the way our family is, is rough!

My eldest grandson, Joshua Wicker is in Kuwait,
and he called home last night, and is all broken
up, but there is no way we can get him home!
He and his Pops were tight!!

God bless you,
Monica Corso

p.s. I am still with the sheriff's office but

Both sides frustrated in DJ's lawsuit 



By Phil Galewitz, Palm Beach Post Staff Writer
Sunday, February 16, 2003




WEST PALM BEACH -- Kevin Kitchens walked into his doctor's office one day complaining of chest pains and shortness of breath.

Stephen Babic, a Delray Beach cardiologist, prescribed a blood pressure pill for the 39-year-old popular disc jockey for WEAT-FM Sunny 104.3. He administered a stress test a week later. Kitchens, an overweight smoker, failed -- miserably. At one point, a nurse had trouble detecting his blood pressure and the test had to be cut short.

Babic decided to wait for 24 hours for complete test results rather than schedule Kitchens immediately for an emergency angioplasty to unclog his arteries.

The next morning, Babic called Kitchens to tell him that he needed to have the procedure the following day.

That afternoon, however, Kitchens called paramedics to his Wellington home after feeling some tingling in his arms and feet, and again complaining of chest pain. He collapsed and died of a heart attack on his living room floor.

Two years after Kitchens' February 1999 death, his parents filed a malpractice suit against Babic.

The case was settled last July, with Babic paying $500,000 and neither side feeling like they got justice.

"I don't think the system worked," says Suzie Kitchens, adding that she and her husband, Bill, took the settlement because they couldn't bear reliving their son's death through a trial and appeals.

Says Babic, whose medical malpractice insurer settled the case over his objection: "This is a perfect example of a frivolous lawsuit."

An autopsy showed Kitchens died of a cardiac arrhythmia -- an irregular heart rate. Babic said it would have been impossible to predict its occurrence. Kitchens' clogged arteries -- which showed up in the autopsy -- were not necessarily the reason his heart stopped, he added.

He said the payout will mean a substantial increase in his malpractice premiums. He now pays $30,000 a year for $1 million coverage, which he expects to increase to $50,000 when his insurance is renewed next month.

He won't pay it. He'll go without insurance or leave his practice.

"Who wins when the community loses a cardiologist with 25 years' experience?" he asks.

I am NOT pleased at all that a public school person Dr. Penn-Williams was chosen by Governor Bush to oversee Homeschooling in Florida!!
Public school personnel do not understand how the homeschooling community works. Let me give you an example.
2/14 I took a homeschool choir of 6 teens to deliver a valentine singing gram to a public school teacher. She was a very nice person and a friend to the family of one of the homeschoolers. Yet we were all amazed at her misconception of homeschooling. On finding that the choir was made of homeschoolers her comment was
" I understand your parents have to work very hard on your socialization opportunities" The opposite is true. These girls are in sports leagues, drama and dance performances, church youth functions and are in high demand as babysitters. This teacher said this to 6 teens in front of her class of 3 alternative students who meet in a portable on an open field surrounded by a fence and separate from the school campus. Do you catch the irony of this statement???!!!???
Just as Public school personnel do not understand trhe needs of the homeschooling community they do not understand individual instruction and how it works. There is a world of difference.14 years as a teacher in the classroom, 21 years as a private music teacher and 11 years as a homeschooling teacher allows me to say this with authority.Mary Hauck

Dear Governor Bush:

I understand that Dr. Alex Penn Williams has been hired to oversee the Office of Non-Public and Home Education.   As a home educator for 11 years, I plead with you to reconsider her appointment.   Having a public school person in this position defeats the statutory autonomy of this office.    

Most people in public education do not understand the uniqueness of home education until they have done it.  It is a totally different animal from Public Education and with, thankfully, much better outcomes at much less cost.   

Please put someone who understands home and private education in charge of this office.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Dear Friends,

 

The state budget proposed by Governor Jeb Bush would eliminate the Jeppesen
VisionQuest program.  Senator Pruitt, Chairman of Senate Appropriations
committee, desires to pass the Governor's budget AS IS.

If the Florida Legislature approves this cut, approximately 15,000 children
in Florida will no longer be provided free vision exams and eyeglasses
annually.  You can help by sending an email to the Governor TODAY.  Ask him
to please help save the VisionQuest program.  Additional programs that may
be impacted are: The Dr. Bruce Heiken Memorial Fund, Palm Beach Health Care
District, The Eyes Program - Broward County.

 

The Governors personal email address is jeb@jeb.org <mailto:jeb@jeb.org> .
(He actually answers mail sent to this address).  Senator Pruitt's email
address is:  Pruitt.ken@flsenate.gov <mailto:Pruitt.ken@flsenate.gov>  

 

Thank you for your help.  Together, we can save a very important children's

Dear Jeb:
I want to thank you that Kevin is in protective custody from the good ole boys at FSP but there are some new developments I want you to know about just in case Crosby tries to tell you some more lies. This is Kevin's picture and you know he's only twenty-one. Imagine this thin structure with twenty more less pounds which is what it is since being at FSP in the last two months. Yes, I can say Mr. Crosby has sent in inspectors but they said you get three meals a day don't you Kevin. But Jeb if the three meals are a teaspoon of nasty Aramark food that if you had a full portion wouldn't be ateable its not going to fill you up. This picture by the way was taken when he got to FSP three months ago. But as Kevin says mom you'll eat anything if your hungry and that's what I do. I have never been so hungry in my life. They did finally take him to medical he's dizzy, his stomach hurts all the time besides more lose of hair and memory loss. All signs of malnutrition and neglect. Crosby's good ole boys have ways to kill you now without beating you to death like they use to I guess they've gotten more clever in retaliation. Also when Kevin tried to let me know that the medical staff there said he was twenty pounds under weight and put legal and private and confidential on the letter they charge him with yet another bogus DR for misuse of mail. It was legal if I'm handing it over to our attorney. How stupid they are they denied  Kevin's appeals on the other two bogus DR's so now they can deal with District Court and the media. I have contacted every major newspaper in Florida about this total bull. I didn't want to have to take such drastic action but they gave me no choice I just hope DOC in Tallahassee has enough sense to see how ridiculous this all is. They think they can do what ever they want again since big daddy is in charge now. Why is that Jeb maybe they know things about him that their holding over his head. I contacted him and asked him to prove to me he is honest and clean up Michael Moore mess. And even said I would make a public apology if I am wrong about him. So lets see how he handles this and we'll know for sure if he's honest or not. I will be in Tallahassee next month with hundreds of other inmates families for a rally and to speak to the Legislature about making laws to make correctional officers accountable for their actions as well as other important DOC issues. I asked to met with Mr. Crosby lets see how he responses to facing Kay Lee and Wanda Valdez face to face. If he can look the wife of the inmate that was beaten to death by his good ole boys while he was in charge. Jeb I'm not asking much just that they leave Kevin the hell alone let him do his last five months and not come home in a pine box. Again this was not part of Kevin's sentence to be treated this way and yes I'm glad he had it hard so he'll never go back but this was over kill don't you think. Suppose this was your son and I know how much you love your children you wouldn't stand for this either. So Crosby can take care of this like he is supposed to or he hasn't seen nothing yet to what lengths I will go to in proving the truth and saying my son's life. Thank You

Subject:	prison education

Dear Governor Bush and Secretary Crosby:

Maybe we should set up an appointment to personally meet and talk.  

For several years now StarCoast-Academy has quietly been servicing our Florida incarcerated with post secondary programs.  At present we have close to 40 incarcerated students, not all are from Florida's prisons.

I don't know of a single incident that there has been a problem caused by our students, or our materials (including highlighters which we have be had to omit from our materials list for some unknown security reason). 

We recently were put through the wringer at Dade C. I. because of your new policy of requiring approval by Warden for secondary education courses. You judge whether it was for security or not.  A student's text and materials were sent back to Special Books, even though we had written approval from the educational department.  The new requirements went into effect before the student received the materials and instead of stopping the materials until there could be new approval, they sent them back.  The Warden wanted a list of materials that were being sent.  That had already been submitted, but I sent it again.  No, she (the Warden) wanted to know how many pencils were in a package and how many pads of paper were being sent.  I called up Specialty Books and asked that information. There is 6 pencils and 7 tablets, I replied to the Educational Department.  The Warden wanted information about StarCoast-Academy on a school letterhead.  I sent that.  No, she wanted the list of materials on the letterhead. I sent that also.  The point being, it has been several weeks now and this student still does not have his materials even if he originally had been approval.  

This list of materials that are used for this course were scrutinized by the Educational Department along with the security department.  Are we going to go through this kind of individual red tape rhetoric for every Warden, and student, at every institution?  We have lost hundreds of dollars in reshipment cost because of approvals being given, and then the mail people send them back anyway.

A standardized approval form needs to be developed.  Florida has disjointed polices from institution to institution. It is a nightmare because there are differing interpretations of the regulations.  The educational department has tried hard to do some standardization of what these rule require.  This new decree shoots that standardization into a million pieces.  It seems that you have negated what the Educational Department has worked so hard to accomplish!  

The Educational Department has been so stripped of staff (85 educators to be exact) our incarcerated, especially the young adult in adult prisons, do not have adequate opportunities for programs.  Face it, it just isn't happening.  

The statistics and studies of educational programs reducing recidivism, has totally been abandoned by the Florida DOC.  All of the emphasis and money is in the power of control of the masses, and not in the power of attitude modification by providing positive opportunities for change.  

The joy of watching inmate's attitudes change when they see positive possibilities in the future, cannot be gotten without giving inmates hope for a better tomorrow.  By not providing inmates with opportunities for knowledge building, and job skills, Florida is killing any hope for a different outcome in their future, and in effect, our current policies are creating a cycle of crime.

The new slogan of Florida could be Punishment Without Rehabilitation.  
It isn't effective. It doesn't work.  Florida's leaders are not looking at the big picture, the one in which these inmates are going to be released into our city streets.

What kind of neighbors are we turning these offenders into?

I personally have jumped though the hoops in trying to follow the rules and regulations to provide these opportunities.  I would appreciate some help from you in personally overseeing that these opportunities for education not be thwarted. 

I would appreciate some feed back on the direction that you are heading.

Hi Jeb,

I have been sharing with several folks about the unbelievable response that 
you gave me.  I am still impressed that you took the time to respond to my 
plea for help  - and actually wrote back. Please recall; I am the 
multi-skilled, BSEE, MBA (utility industry professional) in Tampa, Florida.

I was just informed about the extent of the support.  (As promised, I called 
back to the respresentative assigned to help.) Wow, it hit me hard.  I am 
still a little upset by it.. Nevertheless, I should have known better.  I 
take responsibility. I have had similar success here in Tampa.

This does not change my GREAT appreciation for your effort - AND it does not 
change my view that in your speech about new jobs in the state of Florida is 
misleading and insensitive!  I don't think a $10/hr job for a college 
graduate - with a masters and more than 15 yrs of experience a job.  I am 
sure you would not wish that life on your kids.  The pain and fear of 
poverty is all I think about these days.. Please keep my words in mind each 
time you say anything about the unemployment situation.. We are listening.. 
while writing hundreds of resumes and living with unbelievable STRESS!

Please give this feedback to Shelia Griffin.. While VERY, VERY nice, 
initially she did not offer a description  of the real (little) help that 
was provided.  Listed in a database of millions is really not much help.  
She should have said something in our first conversation...I think I was 
already in the database... I participated in Operation Paycheck + my weekly 
visits to the Employment office...  It hurt.. I would have saved the long 
distance phone calls.

My plans are to be in the Tallahassee area in the next few weeks.  I also 
plan to start calling each of the agencies to discuss my background and 
offer suggestions about how I may add value - particularly in the area of 
operational effectiveness.  Six Sigma and other TQM efforts are GREATLY 
needed in the governmental systems.

Thanks again.  Jan

Subject: Fwd: FW: American Board Field Test information

Happy snowy President's Day. Attached is a message to charter schools inviting their teachers to take the field tests now under development for the new American Board for Certification of Teacher Excellence (ABCTE), a field test being conducted by ACT. It has just 5 days left to run, so speed is of the essence. (Tests must be taken by Feb. 22.) Besides taking part in an exciting project (read more at http://www.abcte.org/) and a worthy cause, participating individuals and schools can make a little money: up to $100 per test taker, and $20 per test taker for those who proctor the tests. ADDITIONALLY, and not shown in the attachment, any participating school that musters at least 20 test takers will receive a "bounty" from ABCTE in the amount of $1000. (If your school is too small to field 20, borrow teachers from a nearby charter school and split the bounty!) You can get additional information on the "bounty" from Kathy Madigan (KMadigan@abcte.org)  or Bill Schimmel (wschimmel@abcte.org). Everything else should be self explanatory in the attachments. The reason for the bounty is that we're down to the wire in terms of numbers of test-takers and need more to sign up quickly and complete the test  promptly in order to get maximum benefit from the field test. I hope this is clear and invite your participation--and encourage you to forward this email to others with prompt access to teachers who might consider this. Many thanks and best regards.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I hope this email finds you and your family doing well! 
 
I wanted to extend an invitation to you and perhaps your staff.  A few months ago I was hired as a consultant to help fulfill the necessary requirements on a new specialty license plate.  ( I know- yet another one).  I was proud to work on this plate as it will help raise funds for cardiovascular disease research.  The Florida Heart Research Foundation has met the necessary requirements and the bill will go through this upcoming session.
 
We will be in Tallahassee on March 6 and 7th to offer free heart screenings to all the legislators and anyone who would like to participate.  I believe we will be working out of Representative Barreiro's office on March 6 and the Rotunda on March 7th. 
 
Please feel free to extend the free screenings to your staff.  If you have a few minutes for a screening or just to come by and say hello- I would love to see you.
 
I realize there are many specialty license plates currently- this would be Florida's second medical one.  This organization does wonderful work and I am happy to be assisting them in their campaign.
 
If you have any questions please contact me - you have my email or my work number (305) 667-0444.  Hope to see you and or your staff members in Tallahassee!

Dear Governor Bush,
    As a life-long resident of Florida, and a homeschooling mother of nine 
years, I write to you out of concern.  I have just learned of the upcoming 
appointment of Dr. Alex Penn Williams to oversee the Office of Non-Public and 
Home Education, and do not believe this is an acceptable choice.   
     Our family has been homeschooling for nine years, and are very grateful 
for the Florida Home Education laws.  We've enjoyed pursuing academic 
excellence for each of our students through a variety of choices of curricula 
and activities.  We watched with eager anticipation as the Education 
Governance Reorganization Task Force worked to improve the 
system.                            
       Homeschoolers in Florida rejoiced to learn that we would be held 
accountable by the Office of Non-Public and Home Education, rather than to be 
included with all the public school students. This office was established, in 
statute, to assure our autonomy, independence, and non-governmental status.   
It is therefore unacceptable to us to have an official who has worked 
entirely with the PUBLIC schools and CHARTER schools.  We would really 
appreciate having someone heading that office who understands the workings of 
non-public education through homeschooling and/or private schools.
    I urge you, therefore, Governor Bush, to reconsider this appointment!  We 
do not believe it is in the best interest of the homeschooled and private 
schooled students in the state of Florida.

Dear Governor Bush,
Please do not hire a public school expert, Dr. Alex Penn Williams  to be over home school education.  I find that unacceptable and I must protest.  Of all the qualified people out there - you surely could have made a better choice.  Someone with home school education experience and administration.  
 
You have shown your support toward Home Schoolers and Private Schools, please do not continue to rape our freedoms by strapping us with more governmental requirements and public school standards.  A majority of parents who home school their children do an excellent job.  They make great personal and professional sacrificies to do so.  There are many home school support organizations to help us.  I don't know of any parent who takes this responsibility lightly.  
 
Many of our children have special needs completely unmet by public school systems and their testing, that is why they have made choices to home school.  Only parents know and understand the special needs of their children.   And most of them want the choice of which tests to administer to their children or evaluations done by certified teachers.  If something is already working, don't fix it.

It has come to my attention that a public school individual has been hired to oversee non-public schools and home schools. This concerns us as a private school. I would like to know why and for what purpose. I am opposed to any oversight by a public school official. Private schools and Home schools are functioning well as is.
The office of non-public schools and home education was created to insure our independence and autonomy. We are non-governmental, so why do we need oversight by someone not even familiar with our independence and autonomy and history in this state? Please reconsider your decision to hire such and individual.

Dear Kathryn,

Thank you for writing Governor Bush to share your concerns regarding
programs for individuals with developmental disabilities. The Governor is
very concerned about Tommy's current situation and has asked me to respond.
Please be assured that access to appropriate supports and services for
Florida citizens with developmental disabilities is a very important issue
for the Governor and the Developmental Disabilities Program.

In an effort to uphold Tommy's right to privacy, we must limit disclosure
of any information pertaining to this case, but please know that we are
doing everything possible to ensure Tommy receives the most appropriate
treatment and services available. In this particular situation, the
Landmark Learning Center does not appear necessary to meet Tommy's needs
and we are exploring less restrictive settings and services. However, I
would like to take this opportunity to address your concerns relating to
the future of Landmark as well as the Governor's continued support for
programs serving individuals with developmental disabilities in need of
more structured settings.

To begin, the Governor's recommended budget includes an additional $3.7
million in new funding to provide 18 additional secure beds at Florida
State Hospital to ensure the Department of Children and Families can
provide trial competency training for persons with mental retardation who
are court ordered and committed to the department per Chapter 916, Florida
Statutes. The Governor has also recommended a redirection of $478,222 in
General revenue to provide 8 additional beds in the Sunland Environmental
Engineered Developmental Systems Program (SEEDS) which offers a non secure,
highly structured step down program for persons exiting or diverted from
the Mentally Retarded Defendant Program.

In regards to the future of Landmark, I share your concern that the most
vulnerable people currently residing in this facility need to be protected
and their needs met. I want to reassure you that our first priority will
continue to be the safety of each consumer. In addition, we will work
diligently to honor the values and choices of families and consumers for
alternative placement outside of Landmark. Most individuals have chosen to
live in the community through the Medicaid waiver program while a small
number have elected to continue services through public or private
institutional care. By the end of June 2003, we will have successfully
placed approximately 120 Landmark residents in either community homes or
other institutional settings.

The decision to phase down and close the Community of Landmark by June 2005
has been given a great deal of consideration. We have implemented an
intricate process to assure that Landmark residents will be safe and well
cared for in any community setting. The process includes:

·     Choice education to provide monthly seminars in which residents and
their families learn about such topics as medical oversight in the
community and how homes are monitored.

·     Choice counseling and home visits to provide an extensive review of
all community options with each resident and his or her family:

·     Meetings are being held to discuss options and concerns which include
the resident's treatment team., guardian, advocates, a community inclusion
specialist, the district placement coordinator  and anyone else the
resident wishes to invite:

·     Selection and hiring by the resident of an independent support
coordinator who is responsible for making sure he or she receives all
necessary services after leaving Landmark.  Recruitment and expansion of
community-based providers are currently in process to meet the demand for
residential needs of persons from the Community of Landmark;

·     Quality assurance monitoring is provided by the Delmarva Corporation
for persons receiving services on the Home and Community-based Services
Medicaid waiver. Persons who continue to reside in public or private ICF/DD
will continue to have their services monitoring by Health Facilities
Regulation Office of the Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA);

·     Follow-up assessments of consumers after they leave include consumer
satisfaction surveys to account for the health, safety and well being of
each resident.

The Governor and all of us appreciate your concerns and continued and
advocacy for quality services for individuals with developmental
disabilities. Please let me know if I can assist you  further.

Sincerely,
Shelly Brantley, Director of
Developmental Disabilities Program

 Subject: since we last spoke, no services,
          client now in Jail




George Lloyd

5701 9th street

Zephyrhills, FL 33542

(813) 780 6047

Re; No services, thus Tommy is currently locked up in the Pasco county
Jail. Locked in a cell, unable to see a doctor, take a shower and/or be
treated like other prisoners because of his medical and mental
disabilities
which he has never been adjudicated as suffering from..

Can/will anyone help him?

His story is the following.

About a year or so ago I sent you correspondence regarding our
developmentally disabled adult son who suffers from symptoms associated
with cerebral palsy with limited intelligence and ability to comprehend
that have been noted to be below basic levels used to diagnoses mental
retardation and our efforts to obtain the services that he so urgently
needed while at the same time explaining the fact that he was supposed
to
have been placed on the states waiting list for these services in 1998
but
because of buareatrc error his application was never noted until 2001.At
that time it was explained that Tommy had met and married a wonderful
young
lady and they had recently had a baby daughter, and Tommy had also
managed
(with a great deal of help and understanding, by a lot of people) to
have
been holding down a minimal paying job at a fast food restaurant despite
the fact that he never received a raise like other workers, he never
complained because he was always grateful just to be working..

Anyway, while on the surface things seemed to be going well in Tommy's
life. Others who knew his situation felt that everything was hanging on
a
thread and that he needed the supports and services other individuals
such
as himself needed in order to stay ahead of the game, (so to speak) and
to
stay ahead he needed the services he was/s by law entitled to receive
but
which it was quickly becoming evident h would not receive because no
matter
what was presented to the state in his behalf, nothing was going to be
done
because in this particular case the state did what some decided was a
bias
inquiry into only the. Issue of his not being placed on the waiting list
when he should have been and need was never a factor while the
investigation focused only on who was at fault and when the state
concluded
that it was another states fault then it also decided that his current
incorrect date of not being placed on the waiting list until 2001 would
not
be changed no matter how desperately he needed the services and we would
find that it never mattered to the state of Florida how desperate his
needs
for intervention had become, and/or would it make any difference how
urgently some local state workers had stated his situation was when
seeking
crisis intervention from Tallahassee in his behalf, nothing would ever
change, and the perception was that right or wrong that the state
couldn't
care less

While nothing changed as to Tommy receiving the services developmentally
disabled adults such as him desperately needed. Things were about to
change
for Tommy who was quickly fallen into some nasty pit holes that the
normal
thinking adult who unlike Tommy are capable of understanding and
avoiding
when unscrupulous adults seek them out and are allowed to manipulate
and/or
exploited the disabled into doing their bidding which frequently
involves
some sort of illegal activities that normal thinking adults will
occasionally use the developmentally disabled and/or children to hid
behind. And when the situation they have involved those they target goes
south, then as usual the normal thinking adult who manilpated the
escapes
seldom ever being held responsible for their actions.

In the case of the mentally retarded adult who frequently appear to be
normal and don't wear signs that state that they are not as intelligence
as
most others are in today's "hang em high society" its easier for the
criminally inclined to use these individuals because most people are
tired
of hearing excuses, and/or defense attorneys saying that a persons
actions/intentions should be judged according to their abilities to
understand and the result frequently is that the truly mentally limited
adult who may be involved in a criminal activity will simply go through
the
legal system without ever receiving any benefit as to what their true
intends ever were

In Tommy's case, this is what has happened to him and because he now
sits
alone in a Pasco county cell unable to see a TV or listen to a radio or
talk with another or even read a book because of his disabilities and
the
fact that he was never taught to read while crying like the child he
mentally is and at the same time pleading with anyone who will listen to
be
allowed to take a lie defector test, so that he can prove to officials
that
he will be good if they let him go.

How can a parent explain to an adult thinking child who believes in his
mind that if he promises to be good that he will be allowed to get out
of
jail and go home?

Obviously its impossible but probably its best to try and explain the
crimes that Tommy committed that brought him to this point, and why
society
has to be protected from Tommy and people like him.

And his crimes are as follows,

About a year or so ago the Zephyrhills police offered a local individual
who has a very long criminal history and/who was facing arrest in
several
serious matters at the time a deal to give the police information
pertaining to ongoing drug activities in the area, in exchange for the
police not prosecuting him for his current crimes, (We have been told
that
this appears to be this individuals usual routine whereas he has
frequently
turned other individuals in, in exchange. For his not being prosecuted
for
crimes that he has committed)



A part of this deal, was that this informant would arrange a meeting
between an undercover officer and another individual who the informant
described was the major local drug dealer in the area.

Obviously the use of informants and undercover police are seem as being
some of the most valuable tools that law enforcement has when confronted
with the skilled and devious criminal elements who have tended to become
knowledgeable about how to avoid being detected and caught. So the
informant who is willing to put their well-being on the line and trade a
devious criminal they associate with in exchange for their freedom
and/or
the undercover police officer who is able to convince the criminal being
targeted that he is himself a criminal, are considered respected and
valuable law enforcement tools and their use if seldom questioned as
long
as they produce an arrest, which they did in Tommy's case which is
explained din the following.

And information received and the arrest records indicate that the
following
occurred.

To put their plan into action the informant brought the undercover
officer
to where Tommy was and then the informant asked Tommy to contact a
individual who almost everyone knew was a regular hanger out at the
restaurant and Tommy was asked to call him and have him bring some
marijuana to his friend, (the undercover officer) who was with him. (Its
worth noting here that almost everyone, including the informant, in the
area knew that the individual they were asking Tommy to contact, was
someone the informant and many of the other workers at the fast food
restaurant knew they could contact anytime anyone wanted any marijuana,
and
now most reasonable minded people, who fond themselves in a similar
situation, would have surely wondered why the informant was so insistent
that someone else call someone, they knew that the informant could have
easily called himself) and this would have caused most intelligent
people,
and especially the capable and devious criminal who was being targeted
by
these extroninary means to be suspicious as to what was really going on.

However, this wasn't an issue in this case because the informant had
been
careful to select the only developmentally disabled individual who
worked
in the vicinity and who he knew was the easiest to manilpate as his
target,
instead of pointing out someone who was involved in the delivery and
distribution of the local drugs who any reasonable minded person knows
would likely be able to lead the police to the higher-up and more
important
sources of the drugs, but who were the informant knew were individuals
the
informant still had to live among, and who the informant knew would be
smart enough to figure out what he was doing and thus likely to
retaliate
against him.

It also curious after Tommy had been identified to the police as being
the
target. Why the police would want to waste the valuable one time use of
an
uncover officer to trap such a low level potential source that they knew
was retarded and obviously could only have been at the lowest level of
the
local drug ladder?

This question was eventually answered and ridding the area of drugs
wasn't
the primary motivation, but for now I continue with the story.

Later that same evening after Tommy was finished working, he found the
informant and the officer wafting for him and apparently its been
verified
that during their meeting the officer gave Tommy $150,00 to buy him some
marijuana, and the meeting ended.

However, instead of Tommy using the money he was given by the police
officer to buy drugs with, Tommy spent the money on candy etc and forgot
about the whole thing until about a week or so later when suddenly the
now
angry police officer confronted Tommy, demanding to know what Tommy did
with the money he had given him to buy the marijuana with? Course Tommy
didn't realize that the individual who was confronting him was a police
officer and rather then tell the truth when Tommy suddenly fond himself
alone and being confronted by this angry individual who was working hard
to
give Tommy the impression that he was himself a criminal involved in
drug
related activities so Tommy tried to make up some weird story that never
made any sense, but didn't make any difference anyway because the only
thing the male now confronting Tommy wanted was for Tommy to call
someone
to bring him some marijuana, and he clearly wa making sure Tommy knew
that
he wasn't happy about not getting it. Apparently, now that the money the
officer had originally given Tommy was gone, the under cover Zephyrhills
police officer gave Tommy some more money to get him some marijuana
with.

Obviously the intensity of this situation was higher this time then the
first because Tommy had reason to believe that he was in trouble and he
wouldn't get out of trouble unless he called someone and whoever he
called
brought some marihuana that the undercover officer wanted.

Thus, its alleged that after that meeting a call was made and the
marijuana
that the police officer had been trying so hard to get may have been
delivered to Tommy, because one morning around that time I remember I
was
sitting at our kitchen table next to the window and I was looking
outside
and noticed that a car had driven up to the front of Tommy house,
(Directly
across the street) and I saw the passenger get out and (with his back to
me) I watched him as he walked into Tommy's yard and over toward where
Tommy's three wheeled bike was parked, and he was stood there for a
moment
until he suddenly turned and went up to Tommy's front door.

A moment later, I noticed that Tommy had open the front door and after
what
appeared to be a brief discussion, the passenger left and returned to
the
car, and both the driver and passenger quickly drove away. (I figured it
had something to do with Tommy's work since it was common to see his
supervisor, co-workers frequently picking Tommy up when he needed a ride
to
work etc) and I didn't think any more about it.

Until a moment later, when I noticed that the same vehicle had returned.
Only this time the driver was alone, and the driver stopped in front of
Tommy's house, got out and went into the yard and appeared to have taken
something from the area of Tommy's three wheeled bike. And then the
driver
returned to the car and drove away?

I would later be informed of the fact that this was when the police
officer
stated in the arrest report that Tommy had given him some marijuana.

We would learn in time that because of that encounter, Tommy would be
arrested and charged with committing a number of very serious drug
crimes
that included but were not limited to charges of dealing drugs within
1000
feet of a school and even an "attempt to deal drugs" & petit thief
(these
last two charges apparently occurred when Tommy took the money and
didn't
use it to buy the under cover officer marijuana/drugs)

In the issue of the very serious dealing within 1000 feet of a school
complaint. This was a criminal charge that even the court questioned
which
has never before been made against any Zephyrhills defendant who has
ever
been arrested in a similar situation despite the many arrests for drug
related activities that have occurred in the very same area that Tommy
was
set up in and in Tommy's case, he was now an alleged drug dealer who
"never
received a dime" from any drug dealings, except for the time when he
spent
the money on Cady etc instead of buying the undercover officer drugs?.

Anyway, it seemed like an awful lot of effort was spent in this effort
that
really did very little to stop the ongoing flow of drugs into
Zephyrhills
which from what I have heard is much stronger now then it ever was with
the
addition of such drugs as crank, speed etc and large quantities of
heroin
that have always had a large presence in the local community.

Regardless, justice had prevailed and now society will have its revenge
as
Tommy enters the justice system where his punishment will be decided.
And
as an individual who is unable to pay for a strong defense it would
quickly
become evident that there wouldn't be any defense period in his case and
thus no one would ever ask anyone associated with the arrest any
questions
and everything alleged, will always be accepted as being truthful fact.

This is simply how it and how it must be when decent but badly
overworked
public defenders are the only thing that stands between a defendant and
prison and in this particular case the solution seemed to be fair
because
after considering the fact that Tommy had never been n trouble before,
his
capable public defender was able to arrange for Tommy to participate in
a
very fair program (that is offered to nonviolent first offenders)
whereas
if he abides by certain and reasonable stipulations, and stays out of
trouble for a reasonable amount of time. Tommy's criminal charges would
be
dismissed and he would be a free individual again.

Obviously there appeared to be no need to argue his mental retardation
and/or the facts of the case because considering the curmstances this
seemed to be a very lenient resolution to his situation, and it was
quickly
accepted and Tommy tried again to get back the life he had before this
stuff started.

However, this would not be the situation that we expected it would be,
and
which it could have been because of several reasons. One being the fact
that some of the more devious criminal elements in the community now
realized that they could get Tommy to do almost anything they wanted and
he
wouldn't expect anything in return and one individual in particular who
we
know only as "Robbie" and who appears to be an older individual with an
extensive criminal record seemed to be hanging around Tommy a lot
despite
the fact being that they had little in common. This Robbie was known to
have been involved in some very serious criminal issues and there was
little reason to believe that he had suddenly decided to straighten out
and
live an honest life and he seemed to have a lot of influence over Tommy,
who would come to believed that Robbie was his good friend

The other problem here was that some in law enforcement openly stated
their
resentment about his receiving what they felt was the light sentence he
had
received instead of his being sent to prison, and there has always been
one
individual in particular who would frequently be seen going out if his
way
to follow, and/or in other ways challenge Tommy and one evening after
Tommy
had finished working he was riding his bike home and apparently this
Robbie
and two others were walking along side Tommy and they walked past a a
police car that was parked, and a moment later the officer in the car
drove
after them and Robbie and the other normal individuals who were with
Tommy
ran away and left Tommy sitting there when the police car drove up, it
didn't matter that they ran because the officer wasn't interested in
them
anyway and never even tried t find out what they an from him, because he
was only interested in Tommy and after making a snide remark about the
court the officer searched Tommy, and fund nothing and then the officer
searched Tommy's three wheeled bike and he alleged that he found an
empty
tobacco pipe that he sad had small amounts of marijuana residue in it.
Therefore he arrested Tommy for, possession of marijuana & drug
paraphernalia and Tommy was again locked up in the Pasco county jail
until
he was released the following day when he awaited trial for these
charges.

It didn't make any difference whether he was guilty or not as far as his
earlier and lenient arrangement was concerned that he received for the
original charges he faced because now, despite the fact that he hadn't
yet
been adjudicated guilty, or not guilty of these latest charges, his
participation in the program was immediately revoked because of his
arrest
and now he had to stand trial for the original charges

And again, now in the court room he was offered probation in exchange
for
his pleading guilty and not seeking a trail and it appeared to be a
simple
enough solution because as long as he stayed out of trouble during the
probationary period the changes would eventually be dismissed and he
would
again be free to re-start his life over again.

And Tommy accepted this offer and pleaded guilty.

Things started to get back on schedule when suddenly Tommy was soon
arrested at his place of employment again? Apparently this time it was
because he didn't realize that he still had to be tried for the last
possession of marijuana and paraphernalia charges (when he was searched
and
his program was violated) and he hadn't called the sheriffs office and
reported in as he was supposed to have done while on bail and also the
court had apparently sent him a notice to appear) to incorrect address
that
he never received) and therefore he had was arrested and again brought
before the court. The situation was explained and again he was released
while he awaited trial, One of the problems this time was that because
of
the ongoing arrests that generally occurred at his place of employment,
he
was fired this time he was arrested and now he really had nothing left
but
he would still be seen hanging around his good friends Robbie and two
others who he always seemed to be around and soon we started to realize
that Tommy was spending an awful lot of money, that neither he nor his
wife
had and eventually we realized that what he was now doing was obtaining
credit cards with thousands of dollars credit lines that he was taking
cash
advances on. While this is stupid there is also a bigger problem here
because Tommy can't read and/or write, and he has never been able to
negiaoate even the simplexes of complexities that are generally required
in
order for one to obtain credit cards and soon we realized what was going
on
Tommy, wasn't the one who was figuring out what to do to obtain the
credit
cards, it was/is his good friend Robbie, and the others who had been
directing Tommy as to how to obtain the credit cards and cash advances
and
they were the ones who would bring Tommy to the banks (and wait a fair
distance away) while they watched Tommy go to a machine (they had
already
coached him how to use) and return with the money he would then give to
them, which we figure has already amounted to about $15- $20,000 in the
last several months and the question we ask is what could they have
given
Tommy in exchange for the money that have been getting from him that
would
cause him to want to continue going along with this absurd arrangement?

It appears from what we are finding out that what they have been giving
Tommy is drugs and/or at least small quantities of marijuana that it now
appears Tommy has become addictive to, and when Tommy reported to his
probation officer and was drug tested it seems that his tests came back
positive, it seems that he had a small amount of marijuana in his urine
and
subsequently because of this, he violated his probation and he is now
sitting alone in a jail cell while his supposedly good friends, (Robbie
etc) who have already manipulated him into giving them thousands of
dollars
have also broken into his home (after finding out he is n jail) and they
have stolen his games, and other personal items of value that they knew
his
wife had in their home and there's nothing anyone will do about it
because
Tommy is now after all supposedly one of the biggest drug dealer in
Zephyrhills that has been brought to justice recently, and obviously
everyone knows that no body really cares what happens to individuals
labeled as being drug dealers .be it even if they are not guilty, and/or
whether they are retarded or not the only thing that counts is the fact
that the local police have cleansed the community of another criminal
and
because of their efforts, local crime has suffered a serious blow, while
drugs continue to flow through-out the community like water, and other
crimes against the citizens such as thief, robbery etc are on the rise
and
while at times individuals associated with those types of crimes appear
to
be almost protected the message is clear that in Pasco county the
disabled
and/or the mentally ill in our community will be prosecuted as competent
adults



And despite the fact that we have repeatedly told/showed the police
and/or
Tommy's lawyers, and anyone else who would listen the hundreds of pages
of
documentation attesting to his mental limitations, i.e, his retardation,
inability to comprehend/understand and aparently everyone refuses to
lsten
saying that in the eyes of the law it doesn't make any difference or,
something like retarded? Naw, we don't think he's disabled and that's
the
end of it. Obviously, it seem that its accepted that any individual who
wears a uniform is qualified to immediately diagnose and decide
extensive
and/or complexes medical diagnoses and the perception is that in the
eyes
of local Pasco law enforcement that any law that says otherwise, such as

Fla Statue chapter 825 re, Abuse/explotiation of disabled adult can be
damned because we don't like it and therefore we are not going to
acknowledge it even exists, never mind enforce it.

And this is exactly what law enforcement has done, and nobody seems to
care.

Meanwhile Tommy Lloyd sits alone in a jail cell by himself, he says he
is
not allowed to take a shower, or to be seen by a doctor, or be taken
outside like the other prisoners are simply because he is disabled and
the
county facility is unable to accommodate his disabilities in order to
ensure that he is not injured and/or given the same privileges, and/or
is
treated the same as other individuals who are in similar situations.

Is there anyone who would be willing to speak with Tommy? No sense in
wrting him anything because he can't read or write.

Attachments:	Redesigning the State of Florida's MH/SA Service Delivery System Quarterly Newsletter 

Governor Bush, as an advocate, I have stated my views to you, over the last four years, concerning Mental Health and Substance Abuse, being transferred to the Health Department.
Mental illness and Substance Abuse are becoming more and more recognized and accepted as the medical diseases they are.
As such, that dictates the need for treatment standards, under the direct supervision of trained clinical personnel. A Psychiatrist, as the Head of any ADM Department, with full responsibility for the treatment of clients, and accountability for both client outcome measures and funds expended. Total decision making authority, above or at least equal to any person established as Head of any Department being contemplated for any ADM transfer within DCF if a transfer to the Health Department is not forthcoming.

Attached is: Redesigning the State of Florida's MH/SA Service Delivery System  News letter. With total cooperation from the Secretary of Children and Families, down through the ranks at all/every level, down to the local providers receptionist (the first line in this chain) the attached System Redesign will work exactly as intended.
If accountability is not strictly adhered to by the Secretary of DCF, and enforced, through the ranks, at all / every level, down to the local providers receptionist, this will be a wonderful opportunity to Redesign Florida's MH/SA. A well thought out plan, that had the principles, in this plan been strictly adhered to, will unfortunately be an excellent idea that met head-on with a bureaucracy not capable, able, or willing to change.

I sincerely hope the bureaucracy is ready to accept the cutting edge future I envision Florida should provide, with a better quality of life, for the clients. This would put Florida, and you, as the leader in MH/SA programs of the future as a model for other states to follow.

Subject:	Request under F.S.119

Dear St. Johns River Management District,
 
Under the provisions of F.S. 119, I am requesting access to any documents regarding public procurement of public lands within Orange County Florida which are currently leased to John Tanner or others.
 
As you are aware, John Tanner has a monopoly on public lands within Orange County, including public land owned by your agency, Orange County and City of Orlando..
As the elected Representative for East Orange Counties poor, I have been asked to obtain information concerning when these properties will be made available for public procurement and the bidding process involved.
I am confident that this monopoly is an oversight on your part and if you were aware that John Tanner has a lease for every parcel of public property at the State, County and city level, you would correct this unfairness and permit small independent ranchers first refusal to these public lands.
 
Is it fair to make the rich richer?
 
Of course not. Which brings Me to the point of this request.
 
I have assembled a group of small independent ranchers who could more appropriately benefit from the lease of these properties while at the same time eliminating the appearance of impropriety in the form of the current monopoly of public property.All that is necessary is information regarding when these properties become available for lease, or in the alternative, revoking any properties currently being leased to John Tanner or others who have dominated this process for far too long, and permit a common standard of fairness and decency to play a part in this process.
 
Please understand, I am only asking for fairness for my constituents and myself, a fourth generation resident of Orange County, who has witnessed this monopoly fester and spread like a cancer, at the expense of taxpayers.
 
I am confident that you will concur that it is better to provide first option to those who are in the greatest need and could most benefit from the lease of public lands.
 Please contact me at the following address with the requested information and I look forward to working with you soon.
Respectfully,
Chairman, Cory E. Goodman

Subject:	Siemens replacing US workers with H1B's

Congressman Mica
Governor Bush

The disturbing element of the following story is that Siemens acknowledges importing workers to replace Americans. While Siemens’ is a German company and is understandably unsympathetic to U.S. issues, I think U.S. law should protect its citizens from actions such as this.

What’s the point in struggling to create American jobs if companies import workers to fill them?

What can you do about this? Please investigate this story and ensure compliance with law. If Siemens has not broken any laws, make a new one. This cannot be allowed.

Long time friend and supporter,

Special: Where Did The Jobs Go? 
Posted: 3:31 p.m. EST February 17, 2003
Updated: 11:31 a.m. EST February 18, 2003
Thousands of Americans in the information technology industry have reportedly been replaced by cheap foreign labor since a cap was raised on an immigration program, according to an exclusive Problem Solvers report.

Special: Where Did The Jobs Go?  <http://cf.local6.com/orlpn/sh/videoplayer/video.cfm?id=1984968&owner=orlpn> 


 <http://www.local6.com/sh/miscellaneous/stories/miscellaneous-55263520010321-120323.html> 



Local 6 News reported that two types of visas, the H1-B and L-1 visa programs, allow foreigners to come to the United States for employment and work in specialized fields like computer programming and software engineering. 
H1-B visas allow U.S. companies, including federal contractors, to hire skilled foreign workers on a temporary basis to supply workers where they cannot find qualified Americans. 
However, the technology workers, who are mostly from India, are not filling empty jobs but actually replacing qualified Americans, according to the report. 
"H1-B's are allowed to come over and work but they're not supposed to displace Americans," Central Florida Siemens' worker Mike Emmons said. 
Emmons said he was forced to train his foreign replacement before being laid off. 
"These people are putting Americans out of work," Emmons said. "They brought the employees into a room and told them what was going happen and that they were going to train them and they held a carrot out and said if you don't stay and train them you won't get your severance. 
Another Siemens worker, James Granberry, said that he was force to train his foreign replacement. 
"So, they up front told you that you're not just being laid off, you're being replaced by other labor?" Problem Solver Steven Cooper asked Granberry. 
"Yes, I was given a list objectives and one of my objectives was to train my replacement," Granberry said. 
Local 6 News reported that workers blame an increase in the cap of H1-B visas. 
Until the year 2000, the number of H1-B visas granted per year was limited to 65,000. However, Congress voted to raise the cap to 195,000. 
Local 6 News reported that Congress raised the cap in 2001 after strong lobbying in part by the Information Technology Association of America. 
ITAA conducted a survey of the job market and concluded there was a huge shortage of qualified I.T. workers. 
The survey was used to convince Congress to raise the cap, which resulted in a wave of foreign worker immigration, Local 6 News reported. 
"I believe its fraud from the ITAA," Emmons said. "Every night I go to bed and think about what our Congress has done to Americans. I go to bed and I just lay there and think, my God, they turned on us like this." 
Cooper asked ITAA spokesman Harris Miller, "We've heard story after story of people who say that these people (foreigners) are not coming to fill new jobs or vacancies but they're coming to replace U.S. workers. 
"I can't respond to every individual situation," Miller said. "I get those e-mails, too, from individuals. I'm sure they're frustrated." 
Local 6 News reported that several large companies like Motorola, Lucent, General Electric and Bank of America laid off thousands of workers in 2001 while at the same time hired hundreds of H1-B workers from overseas. 
"It all goes back to corporate citizenship, which doesn't exist today," Granberry said. 
Siemens, in its response to the story, said that the company does not deny any of the issues raised in the Local 6 News report. 
Siemens has disclosed that it does contract work out to a consultancy service which brings workers here to fill certain jobs. 
The company said that it has taken these actions to operate the information technology function of its business more efficiently. Siemens also said that it has so far helped five of the affected employees find other comparable positions in the company. 
Cooper said, "While the company does distinguish between full-time employees and contractors, we should point out that its American contractors who say they've just been replaced with other contractors-- who happen to be foreigners.

Subject:	FRAG

Hi, my name is Jamie Hall. My sister and I are students at Florida Southern
College in Lakeland. Because Florida Southern is a private school and we are
Florida residents, we receive the FRAG. As you already know, we are facing a
possible reduction in the size of this grant. Florida Southern is also
facing a tuition increase which will make the annual cost of tuition well
over $20,000 per student. My mother is a public school teacher in Florida
and an alum of Florida Southern. She has always told us she would love to
see her daughters graduate from this school, however, money is tight and
every little bit helps. We have other scholarships but the FRAG is a
tremendous help. I don't know if you, the governor, will actually read this
letter personally, but I would strongly urge whoever does to please pass on
the message that the FRAG is a vital part of many private college students
financial aid and should not be reduced. Private colleges shouldn't be
limited to those students who can afford to pay the costly tuition. Please
consider the thousands of students this grant reduction will effect.

Sincerely,
Jamie Hall

Hi, John,
let's give it one more try. SB 1248 - the Mandated Property Reform Task Force bill, written by members of our organization - is filed for the upcoming session. The House companion bill has been filed as well. Let's concentrate on righting the wrong. According to my information so far the bill will be supported by our legislators here in St. Johns County. Our condo friends down in Miami are gathering support from legislators there. 
Other States, competing with Florida for retirees, are seriously working on new legislation. I guess they have seen the writing on the wall? What happens in the Shores is definitely wrong, but think of the poor homeowners in Eagles Reserve, who are losing their homes to foreclosures, because they are held responsible for building defects in their community? Pay $ 80.000.00 or lose your home? This is wrong, but so far nobody is willing to put a stop to it!
Let's see if our legislators are willing to work on solving the many problems for homeowners this session? 
Keep up the faith that we all voted for the right people!

Take care
Jan

A classic demonstration of the confidence of the HOA's belief that they control the law in Florida took place at the St. Augustine Shores Board meeting 2/17. In a discussion of the next years budget the subject of legal expenses was raised. The question involved the Board's suit against 19 homeowners for violation of board assumed rules. The president, Terry Brannon stated that there was no need for this contingency since the laws of Florida were such that HOA"s never lost law suits and the law was such that the homeowners would have to pay the boards legal costs.
A small part of a long battle with a Board that listens to no one. Not even the zoning manager of St. Johns County.
Keep up the good work for the people. If the retirees of the north only new of the developer, HOA, and condo operators predatory treatment of our citizens they would stay away in droves.............John Geiszler

FROM: Stephen A. L. Rothschild


     Dear Minister Shalom:

     Subject to and in conformity with applicable law and good ethics, I am respectfully requesting a meeting with you, or your deputy with a view to meeting you for a consulting agreement between my company (USA Government and Commercial Entity Number 053J5) and ISRAEL. The consulting agreement contemplates that without limitation it would be followed or paralleled by US interests, which would result in enhancing the economic recovery, indeed thriving, of ISRAEL's and the US's economies and likely Spain and other countries agreeable while benefiting world humanitarian ethical issues involving health, the economy, jobs and the sanctity of the work place.

     In this connection, I (my company) as owner of certain trade secreted intellectual property rights in the below described processes would as such begin the process intended to result in the sustainable desired status.  

     I am making this proposal to the State of ISRAEL to sponsor my company beginning as a Consultant/Owner/Inventor and continuing as the Prime Contractor/Owner/Inventor of the intellectual property of the activity set out below, on the Angelfire web- site and in Dr. Miller's  and John F. McCarthy Jr.s’s recommendations.

Recommendation to Stephen  A. L. Rothschild From Dr. Nancy Ann Miller May 
05, 2002 

"Based upon my professional experience, information, belief, education and expertise, it is my considered professional opinion that the sole proprietorship of Stephen A. L. Rothschild has the requisite systems engineering, managerial and integrative skills and, with proper and sufficient financing and approvals, should be able to successfully complete the provision of an integrated approach that would bring together the capabilities of information technology, organizational management, marketing and capital investment to develop or provide a system that could be used to (1) provide proof-of-concept(s) for any or all of the Communications Clearinghouse components: the Confidential computer-based Patient Record (including the Biowar Early Warning System module), the Media Communications Company, and/or the Monetary Communications Company, (2) demonstrate their utility and cost effectiveness, and (3) implement them, making them available, globally." Signed Dr. Nancy Miller May 5, 
2002

JOHN F. MCCARTHY, JR., BA, JD, ESQUIRE, is a senior and key shareholder and attorney at the world's largest labor law firm practicing exclusively in the United States, Littler Mendelson. Mr. McCarthy obtained his undergraduate degree in Finance and Economics, and received his Juris Doctor Degree from the University of Texas Law School. Mr. McCarthy gives the following full recommendation of Stephen A. L. Rothschild, without (reservation): 

Stephen A. L. Rothschild "...possesses outstanding characteristics as both an attorney and an independent business planner...successful in structuring profitable businesses.. I recommend without (reservation)..., John F. McCarthy, Jr., Esquire, Shareholder Littler Mendelson, Dallas, Texas Office  Telephone: 1-214-880-8102.

     We have had good results, but as customary, of course there can be no guarantees, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary there are no guarantees.

      It would be intended that with success benefits to ISRAEL would include without limitation and intended to provide a sustaining enhancement of the economy, security and general welfare of every man, woman and child, including without limitation a fund for orphans, and young men and women, providing for their support, education, and a dowry for marriage. The education would include without limitation an ethical educational tract and livelihood tract in media and business administration in the beginning.

     Although I can not guarantee it, if, ISRAEL, responds, now, I believe the greatest potential good can be realized, however, time is of the essence. I believe transfer account credits allowing financing of the initial and following agreements exist that do not burden ISRAEL. For ease of communication time in the current circumstances, I have copied John McCarthy, Jr. Esquire and necessary parties.

     My telephone number in ISRAEL is 051 953 222 and e-mail at RothschildBank_1@lycos.com or RothschildBank@lycos.com

     Thank you.

Dear Governor,
I appreciate your interest to-date in not increasing Florida's gambling.
Please, Governor, do not let Video slot machine gambling happen in this
state. This "recreation" does not attract the type of people I want to see
here. Please see following story from the Orlando Sentinel.

Gambling interests make pitch

By Linda Kleindienst and Kathy Bushouse | Tallahassee Bureau
Posted February 17, 2003

TALLAHASSEE -- With Florida facing a potential $4 billion shortfall in next
year's budget, state gambling interests are betting on renewed legislative
interest in allowing video slot machines.

The state's pari-mutuels, along with dog and horse breeders, have poured
more than $6.2 million into the past four state elections -- including $2.4
million during the 2002 campaign season -- in hopes of encouraging state
leaders to keep an open mind about expanded gambling.

The incentive: $1 billion or more for the state's cash-strapped schools and
a financial boost of several hundred million dollars for ailing dog and
horse tracks and jai alai frontons, according to industry and legislative
staff estimates.

"If we've got to educate the young people and take care of older people, we
can't do that on a wing and a prayer. We need to be able to pay for it,"
Jack Cory, a Tallahassee lobbyist for greyhound breeders, said. "And
one-third or more of the money [from video lottery] will be coming from
tourists."

Once-reluctant legislative leaders have agreed to hearings on the video
lottery. The first will be Tuesday before the House Subcommittee on Gaming
and Pari-mutuels.

Gov. Jeb Bush, once a staunch opponent of what he considers expanded
gambling, apparently is no longer so staunch.

What has changed is the economy, now so soft that it has slowed the flow of
tax dollars needed to run the government and a multibillion-dollar public
initiative that voters passed last fall to limit class size. Local
governments where the frontons and tracks are also stand to gain from
gambling.

The proposal would give the state Lottery Department control over the video
lottery.

Florida's pari-mutuels face the same financial worry the state does. The
industry, created in 1931, flourished for decades, until the 1990s.

Attendance at Florida's 26 frontons and tracks dropped from 17 million in
1980 to 2.8 million last year. Bettors have been lured away by the state
lottery, Indian and Internet gaming outlets, and "cruises to nowhere" that
open gaming tables as soon as the ship gets beyond state waters -- and out
of the reach of tax collectors.

As recently as 10 years ago, pari-mutuels pumped $110 million into the
state's school budget. Today they contribute $37 million -- a drop partly
due to tax breaks that legislators approved to keep the industry alive.

The Legislature tried to boost the tracks and frontons in 1996 by
authorizing pari-mutuel permit holders to run low-stakes games of poker,
bridge, rummy, canasta, hearts, dominoes and mah-jongg. But the card rooms
can't compete with the large-pot games of the tribal casinos, which operate
under federal jurisdiction.

Voters have been a hindrance, too, rejecting casinos in 1978, 1986 and 1994.

But as legislators grapple with two unpopular choices -- raising taxes or
cutting popular programs -- resistance to further gambling could weaken.

Senate President Jim King, a Jacksonville Republican and longtime friend of
Howard Korman, president of the Jacksonville-area dog tracks, is ready for a
hearing.

"I intend to move forward with looking at video lottery as an alternative,"
King said recently. "I'm not suggesting it's the solution, but I want to
take the blinders off."

The House could be harder to sell on the idea.

"To hold the state budget hostage for gambling, I think, would be a
mistake," House Speaker Johnnie Byrd, R-Plant City, said. Yet he has
instructed several committees to air the proposal.Industry leaders say
lagging profits have resulted in lower winnings for horse and dog owners who
now take their prized animals to states where they can make more money.

Supporters say video lottery will bring in enough money to stave off program
cuts and pump life into the industry. It has happened in other states.

In 2002, video-lottery betting at Delaware's one harness and two
thoroughbred tracks brought in $565 million. The state took $200 million,
the tracks got $272 million and $62 million went into enhanced purses.

In Delaware, Iowa and West Virginia, the introduction of video lottery
brought larger crowds to the tracks.

"Good horses will end up going to those tracks, and people want to see the
best athletes," Sen. Steve Geller, D-Hallandale, said. He is a longtime
supporter of video lottery and is the Florida Legislature's gambling expert.

"We are talking about one of the biggest industries in our state . . . and
we cannot afford to lose that industry," Geller said.

Gov. Bush, 
Hello. Jim Stratton here again at the Orlando Sentinel. We exchanged e-mail recently about high-speed rail. 
That's why I'm writing again. 
I wanted to ask if the four proposals submitted to build and run the state's high-speed rail system satisfy your requirements for private investiment. Do they bring enough money to the table? Do they carry enough of the risk? If you've not yet made your decision, can you give me a sense when you might?

And lastly, where will you set the bar as far as how much the private firms need to bring to the project? What type and level of private spending are you looking for?

Thanks in advance, 
Jim Stratton

Dear Governor Bush:

I would like to voice my sincere concern over the plans to hire Dr. Penn-Williams to oversee the Office of Non-Public and Home Education. I don't feel that a person who has no knowledge of, or experience in, the homeschool environment can adequately oversee this department.

While most of us homeschool parents have no problem being held accountable for our children's education, we like the freedoms we have now in how that is done.  Home education in Florida is proven to work, please consider carefully before hiring someone who would very likely change that.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my opinion.

I am the home educator of  my six year old dyslexic child. I was just made aware that Dr. Alex Penn Williams was given the position of supervising the Office of Non-Public and Home Education. In general, home educators feel that having a public school person over home education is not the beneficial to our situation. It would more likely be suited for someone with a home education background. 


Please consider those who have made the choice to educate our children in our homes. We all rallied behind your election and have supported your efforts, do not make things so difficult for homeschoolers that we are unable to continue doing what we feel is right by our children. Our children benefit by our teaching them, just as others benefit from the public schools. Please let us continue to have the right to choose and enjoy the choice. Please do not allow the homeschooling community to be restrained by red-tape and unneccessary standardization or even more testing. 

As I understand, the history behind the establishment of the Office of Non-Public and Home Education was in statute, to assure our autonomy, independence, and non-governmental status. Please do not take this freedom away from us! We continue to support you and ask for your support..

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Karina Kremin



May your year be filled with love, laughter, family, & friends!

Dear Governor
Thank you for asking and the opportunity for input. The Chairman of your Task Force, Mr. John Hitt has done a very creditable job in fleshing out the difficult areas of the insurance market in Florida as it relates to both the medical and business community. Their recommendations are very much on target and worthy of strong, favorable consideration by the Legislature.
 The work done in this vein in several other states may serve to reinforce the work of the Task Force: Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho and West Virginia have legislation which (1) abolishes joint and several liability for punitive and compensatory damages, (2) raises the standard for imposition of punitive damages to "clear and convincing evidence" of actual fraud, malice, or willful or wanton conduct.(3) limits punitive damages to the lesser of three times compensatory damages or $250,000. Allows the cap to be "unscrewed "if there is clear and convincing evidence of specific intent to harm. (4)limits venue to the judicial district in which the action occurred, the plaintiff or defendant resides, (5) requires that expert medical negligence testimony come from a physician licensed in the same specialty as the defendant; (6) provide penalties sufficient to discourage both plaintiff and attorneys from bringing frivolous suits. 
Perhaps Governor, with so many qualified people looking at this issue, we can convince potential claimants to take responsibility for their own actions rather than attempting to place blame on others, an action actually encouraged by a small contingent of the legal community.

Dear Governor Bush: 
We know you share the industry's concerns for the escalating cost of insurance in Florida and the country. While in fact the focus is currently on medical malpractice, American Trucking Association President and CEO Bill Graves reminds us that it runs very deep in the business community as well. Attached is a letter from him to President Bush outlining the devastating impact increasing insurance costs are having on the trucking industry. In 2002, Florida has experienced a significant increase in both trucking companies going out of business or leaving the state in favor of other jurisdictions with  more favorable business practices. Perhaps you know that one of Florida's pioneers in refrigerated transportation, Alterman Transport, Opa Locka, is closing its doors at the end of February.Many smaller trucking companies have already done so because of increases in the cost of insurance. 
We appreciate your efforts to work with the Legislature in addressing this issue with some creative solutions. Simply placing caps on awards does not solve the problem. You have some extraordinarily talented resources in both Senator Posey and Representative Berfield in your court who will bring those creative solutions to bear on the problems. The medical and business communities in Florida are desperate for some solutions to this stifling problem.

Dear Governor Bush:
 
I am writing to inform you that I, along with many other homeschoolers in Florida, find the appointment of Dr. Alex Penn Williams to oversee private and home education unacceptable. Dr. Williams' expertise is in charter schools, testing, and accountability. In no way does this qualify her to oversee home education, nor do we homeschoolers believe that she truly understands home schooling.
 
The Office of Non-Public and Home Education was established to assure our autonomy, independence, and non-governmental status.  To place a "public school expert" in charge of this office is a direct conflict of interest and would defeat the purpose for which this office was intended.
 
Homeschoolers in Florida have been extremely successful, achieving test scores that are frequently higher than our children's public-schooled peers.  Our systems work - please do not change them.

Dear Governor Bush,

 

A friend of mine, John Trinanes, gave me this email so I could write to you.  I am writing in the hopes that you will be able to help my dear friends, as it appears no one else can.  The horrible details that lead to a beautiful 2 year old boy being removed from the only real family he ever knew, that of his paternal grandparents, and placed into a dangerous and unfit environment are many.  As you are an extremely busy man, I will try to keep this as brief as possible.  

 

On September 19th 2000, Kenneth Lorber Jr., was born to Jennifer Lynn Ricotta and.  Kenneth Lorber Sr.  Jennifer Lynn Ricotta had previously given birth to two other children by two different fathers.  Both children had been taken away by the Department of Child & Family Services and her parental rights were terminated.  The reasons for TPR were many, including domestic abuse and neglect.  Specifically, putting alcohol in the infant's bottle so it would sleep, thus causing permanent brain damage to the child and leaving her locked up, unattended, so she could go out.  She also has an extensive criminal record, which I've obtained, which includes domestic abuse and battery.  If you desire, I can forward it to you in a .PDF format.

 

Shortly before Kenneth Jr.'s first birthday, Kenneth Lorber Sr. was incarcerated.  DCF was going to remove Kenneth Jr. from his mother's custody and put him in foster care. His paternal grandparents, Cal and Carole Lorber, who'd been active grandparents and offered continual financial assistance since his birth, asked to take him.  They worked with DCF and took Kenneth home.  Both Cal and Carole cut back on their hours at work so one of them would be home with Kenneth at all times.  They redecorated a room and made a nursery.  They took him to the zoo, they gave him birthday parties, they celebrated holidays...they gave him a family that included aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents and great-grandparents.  They gave him love...and opportunities he would never have had otherwise.  I have several photos of Kenneth, Carole and Cal, as well as several members of his extended family that show how happy everyone was.  I can email these as .PDF files as well.

 

For fourteen months, Carole and Cal drove Kenneth Jr. three hours so his mother could have her supervised visits.  On his birthday, she never brought a gift.  When Kenneth couldn't make a visit because of an illness, she never called to see how he was feeling.  During the entire 14 months, Jennifer Ricotta never once called to say hello to Kenneth Jr.  Also during this 14 month period, Jennifer Lynn Ricotta had another child with Timothy Robertson.  Timothy Robertson has an extensive criminal history as well, and is a known sex offender.  I've obtained his criminal records and can forward them as well.

 

For the entire time Kenneth Jr. was being cared for by his grandparents, DCF insured them that they were strongly recommending against reunification of Kenneth with his mother and assured them they had nothing to worry about.  Unfortunately, DCF never filed for TPR!  When the case went to court, the judge had no choice but to reunite Kenneth Jr. with his mother as no one ever filed for the termination of Jennifer Ricotta's parental rights, despite DCF's objections of reunification.  Forty-eight hours after the judge's decision, a DCF transporter tore a screaming Kenneth away from his family and home and delivered him to a woman he hardly knows and a known sexual offender.  

  

Since the decision, Carole and Cal have filed an appeal and spoken to lawyers, law enforcement officials and DCF.  All of which state because of the judges order, and prior to the appeal, the only way Kenneth can be brought home is if something happens that warrants him being removed from his mother's custody.  In short, Kenneth needs to be hurt first.   Given both Jennifer Ricotta's and Timothy Robertson's histories of child and domestic abuse, child neglect and DUI, it's only a matter of time before this happens.  I can't believe waiting for a child to come to harm is the best and most reasonable choice available.  

 

I'm not sure of your legal powers with regards to this case, but as Governor, I was hoping you could set aside the judge's order until the appeal is heard and a TPR is filed.  Justice can't be served by putting a two year old at risk for even a second.  If after the appeal, when all the facts are heard and the proper paperwork is filed the judge still sees fit to grant custody to the mother...so be it.  But his decision should be an educated one where he is free to do the right thing, not simply bound by the letter of the law and shackled by a mere clerical error.  Please give Kenneth the best chance for a wonderful, productive and happy future.

 

Thank you for your time and consideration.  If you need to reach me, I can be reached at 561.883.7768 or 561.883.5124.  Take care and God bless.

 

Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Bush,

Yesterday and last evening I learned of a sad situation at Florida State Prison
regarding the methodical starvation of a 21 yr old inmate.

Obviously this inmate is being starved by rogue guards in an attempt to quiet his mother who's most active in prison reform in our state.

Will you please help save the life of this 21 yr old boy from certain death at FSP?

He's now lost almost 30lbs since his arrival at FSP.  He's experiencing dizziness, nausea, headaches, hair loss and extreme weakness (which are all signs of  malnutrition).  

courteously,
Betsy

Dear Governor Bush:

I would first like to personally thank you for the opportunity I had to
serve the citizens of Florida as an intern in your External Affairs office
over the summer.  I gained valuable knowledge about state government and
general office life that will certainly serve me well in the future.  I am
truly grateful to you and your most welcoming and able staff.

Please also allow me to compliment your on your successful reelection‹your
proven fiscal responsibility, leadership skills and enthusiasm will help our
great state maintain its reputable standing.

As a rising junior, my school‹the University of the South‹has offered me a
scholarship that will allow me to intern in a political office during the
summer of 2003.  Having had such a positive experience in your office, I am
applying to serve in the White House under the President.  Brandi Langford
graciously wrote me a letter of recommendation for my work last summer, but
I would be eternally grateful for your recommendation to this position in
Washington, D.C as well.  As I am sure the staff in External Affairs will
tell you, I am a diligent young conservative who believes in the Republican
Party and the Bush Administration.

I am requesting to work in the Office of Policy Development, and the name of
the intern coordinator, to whom the letter should be addressed, is Michael
Sanders.  

Regardless of your decision, I thank you again for giving me the opportunity
to work with you and your staff and for your time in reading this letter. I
have great confidence in your next four years as Governor, and I wish you
the best.

Thankfully yours,

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am writing to you because I have tried everything else.  I completed my masters degree in Emotional Hadicaps in 1999 under the critical teacher shortage program.  I had been in the public school system since 1990.
 
Just after I received my masters my husband had a severe stroke in May of the same year.  He had previously managed an Orthopedic Brace company.  He later suffered a second stroke and prostate cancer.  He is now permanently and totally disabled.  I don't have to tell you about the salary we lost in excess of 30,000 with yearly bonuses.  I eventually had to leave my job to care for him.  When I was finally able to go back to work I had to take a cut in pay here at Seminole Community College as the transition specialist for students with disabilities.
I am unable to pay my loan I have spoken with everyone that I can speak with.  I have gotton one forebearance after the other.  I do not qualify for a deferment even though my salary loss has been substantial.  There is no money.  With budget cuts its not likely that there will be additional income.  I am barely making ends meet.  My credit is poor as a result of my circumstances my obligations remain the same.
 
Nothing is all black or white.  There are gray areas such as mine, there has to be something someone is willing to do to help me and others that may fall into this category.
 
I am trying to re-finance my home.  It may be possible to get enough to pay 50% of my loans but what happens to the rest?  Do I owe this the rest of my life because of something I had no control over?  I know how busy you are, but I am desperate and just felt my alternatives have been exhausted.  Will you help me.
 
Respectfully,

Dear Jeb,
There is a company from Montreal, who got a commercial awarded over they week

I had to talk them into filming here, and as you know, it has not been good

Is there someway, you could advice me, how to bring these people in on short

Subject: Airboat Noise


Dear Gov. Bush,

As a supporter of yours, I am aware of the good you
are doing for the citizens of Florida and in
particular for those of us who treasure the natural
environment it has to offer. You are no doubt aware of
a movement among the citizenry to correct the problem
of excessive noise from unmuffled airboat engines.
This movement is gaining momentum throughout the State
of Florida as various counties pass laws to help curb
this blight on our waterways. Airboaters themselves
are seeking solutions.
 
However, there is a statewide problem that inhibits
both law enforcement and public action. The problem is
our State agencies that procure and operate vessels
that do not comply with existing State and County
laws. Florida Statute #327.65 says that they must have
an effective muffler and some counties (Marion just
recently) have adopted part two of that law which says
they must produce less than 90 DBAs. Realizing that
our own State Agencies cannot operate their vessels in
those counties without breaking the law, is leading
the more responsible leaders in those agencies to
scramble to bring their vessels into compliance. 
 
Dennis David, Regional Director of the FFWCC is a
willing participant in getting quieter vessels and
needs your support to fight the Bureaucratic
resistance to change. For these agencies to hide
behind the age old argument that the prop makes all
the noise is useless. The prop noise becomes a problem
only at high RPMs and this is operator controlled. If
an airboat is operated in a responsible way, prop
noise is not a factor. Lack of a muffler, flex pipe,
and straight through toy mufflers do not quieten the
exhaust of large combustion engines, and this noise
will produce over 90 DBAs at a low RPM and magnify the
total noise at higher RPMs. These engines can be
muffled with regular automobile muffler so as to
produce no more sound than your family sedan. WHY NOT?
It is not expensive. Mufflers cost from $25 to $75
plus an installation fee.
 
This is an appeal to the legislators and the Governor
to help courageous administrators like Dennis David
comply with Florida law. This problem has to be solved
before we can expect the airboaters to willingly
comply with any noise ordinance. The various Florida
agencies can set an example for all airboaters to
follow, and can enforce the laws of the State without
tongue in cheek.
 
Please help by supporting this whenever you can to
help correct this problem.

Sincerely,
Sandra Reynolds

Subject:	Please Reconsider Appointment of Executive Director of the Office of Private Schools and Home Education

Dear Governor Bush, 

An issue has come to my attention which I feel I must address. As a person with extensive background in working both with private schools and home education (being a homeschooler for the past 14 years myself), as well as someone who is working at the master's level toward a degree in school counseling with emphasis in gifted education, I feel I have a unique perspective regarding the recent appointment of Dr. Alex Penn Williams as the Executive Director of the Office of Private Schools and Home Education. 

I have looked over the qualifications of Dr. Williams. Her background in her field is admirable. Her credentials are impeccable. However, her credentials have absolutely nothing to do with the job for which she has been chosen. She has worked with public schools and public school related institutions entirely -- charter schools are still public schools as written in the law. I am able to find no references whatsoever toward any experience having to do with private schools, let alone homeschooling. The position for which she has been appointed was created to provide an advocate and information source for private schools and home education -- she cannot possibly do this with groups of educators whose viewpoints and methodology she does not understand. To put her into this position would be a disservice to that section of your constituency (which, I might add, includes some of your strongest supporters on the whole). It would also be a disservice to Dr. Williams as it would put her in a position which she is unlikely to perform well. The description of the position in the new law implies that the person in this position must have at least a very good, even an in depth understanding of how and why both private schools and home educators work. Homeschoolers especially require an advocate who understands the unique needs of tailoring an education to each child individually, and who works with them in minimizing government interference in doing so. Dr. Williams shows no background in any of these areas -- without that experience, even the best of intentions will go badly astray. 

Surely there were other candidates for the position with better qualifications in these areas! Please reconsider the appointment of Dr. Williams and request that a person be appointed who is more qualified to work with these two independent and non-governmental educational groups. 

Thank you for your consideration and attention to this matter. 

 

Sincerely, 

Susan M. Sikes

Subject:	RE: State Land Purchase by Manatee School Board

Governor Bush,

I am very disappointed and frustrated to report that last night, our
School Board approved purchase of the IFAS property on SR70 for $915,000
over the appraised value. The only recourse we have is to now ask for
your support in the required lease agreement. As another governmental /
educational institution, we received no consideration on the purchase
price of the land....not even for fair market value of $11,075,000.

Now we must negotiate a lease thru October 2005 for IFAS to continue to
operate on a sizeable portion of the property. There is an expectation
that they will pay a nominal lease for the next 2.5 years. Our
position,(and I do speak for the board, as we discussed it at length
last night)is that we should get as close to fair market value as
possible for the lease of the property. In a time when government and
especially education is under scrutiny and criticism to operate like a
business, I think this is only fair. I sincerely hope that you and the
cabinet would support this sound & fair business practice.

Dear Governor,

I have been in contact with Brewser Brown & Kent Perez concerning this
issue. We (the Manatee School Board) are having a hard time with
agreeing on a final price for the purchase of the UF/IFAS property on SR
70.

We want to build a school and possibly a park on the site. Our
appraisals avg. is $11,075,000. UF/IFAS & DEP don't want to budge off of
an $11,990,000 selling price. Law requires a Super majority 4/5 vote to
approve this purchase because it is $915,000 above our appraised Fair
Market value.

In a tough economy, tight budgets, Ammendment 9 looming, and explosive
growth in our community, I have a hard time looking in our taxpayers
eyes and telling them we are going to pay almost $1 million more than we
need to for property.

Bottom line, I have included a short brief outlining the details along
with a spreadsheet of information about all 4 appraisals that were done.
Governor Bush, we need your help. To be blunt, we feel as though we are
being treated like a private developer when the land in question was
originally deeded to IFAS in the 1960's from the Manatee School Board
for  NO MONETARY CONSIDERATION. Now we are having to buy it back for $11
million. Please help us save the $915,000.

Thanks for your consideration.

History of Bill of Rights

 

George Mason and Eldridge Gerry proposed the appointment of a committee to draft a Bill of Rights which failed. George Mason refused to sign the Constitution for various reasons, one of which was the absence of a Bill of Rights. There were those who believed a Bill of Rights was not necessary since the power arose from and was founded upon the will of the people rather than a safeguard to protect the governed from the powers of rulers or monarchs. Their argument was that a Bill of Rights was necessary in a monarchial government in order to carve out exceptions to monarchial powers. However, this was not necessary where the power emanates from the people since that not expressly granted to the government was retained by the people and States. Under the Constitution, the ultimate power was to rest with the people and not the government. On June 8,1789, James Madison introduced proposed amendments to the Constitution which were based for the most part on the Virginia Declaration of Rights of which George Mason was the principal architect. The first ten amendments are known as the Bill of Rights. They were passed by Congress on September 25, 1789 and became effective December 15, 1791.

 


THE BILL OF RIGHTS


 

ARTICLES IN ADDITION TO, AND AMENDMENT OF, THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, IPROPOSED BY CONGRESS, AND RATIFIED BY THE LEGISLATURES OF THE SEVERAL STATES PURSUANT TO THE FIFTH ARTICLE OF THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION

 


AMENDMENT [1]*


 

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging: the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

 

* Only the 13th, 14th, 15th, and 16th articles of amendment had numbers assigned to them at the time of ratification.

 

FIRST AMENDMENT  (1791)


Adopted 1789, Effective 1791


 

The First Amendment makes no mention of a "wall of separation between church and state", nor does it require complete separation of religion and government. The First Amendment religion clauses were intended to prohibit the establishment of a national church or sect as is best exemplified by the language that James Madison proposed for what ultimately became the religion clauses of the First Amendment.

 

"The civil rights of none shall be abridged on account of religious belief or worship, nor shall any national religion be established, nor shall the full and equal rights of conscience be in any manner, or on any pretext, infringed:"  Annals of Congress 434 (June 8th, 1789).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(2)

 

Originally, the First Amendment did not apply to the states, but only to Congress. Despite its history, the Supreme Court in Everson v. Board of Education, 330 U.S. 1, 16 (1947) interpreted the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment as follows:

 

"In the words of Jefferson, the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect' a wall of separation between church and state'. Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. 145, 164 (1879):”

This language from Reynolds was quoted from Thomas Jefferson, who, in addressing a Committee of the Danbury Baptist Association in 1802 fourteen years after the Amendments were passed, wrote:

 

"[Contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should 'make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof', thus building a wall of separation between church and state:' 8 Writings of Thomas Jefferson 113 (H. Washington Ed. 1861).

 

It should also be noted that Thomas Jefferson was in France from 1784-1789 and was not in attendance for the convention or debates on either the Constitution or Bill of Rights. The Supreme Court has continued to utilize the metaphor "wall of separation between church and state" in deciding religious issues, holding that the Constitution requires separation of church and state. This policy has resulted in an elimination of religion in many aspects of American life.

 

The Constitution of the U.S.S.R. mandates the complete separation of church and state. Article 52 states "The church in the U.S.S.R. shall be separated from the state, and the school from the church:'

 


BLAINE AMENDMENT


 

NOTE: The First Amendment was not intended to apply the states-only to Congress. On June 8, 1789, Madison proposed several amendments including an amendment that certain portions of the First

Amendment ought to apply to the states. This proposal, however, was not included in the final amendment.

She attended my son's IFSP and was given access to knowledge protected under FERPA.  Ms. Purvis made some interpretations of law.  Further, to date she is the last bit of hope anyone in the Early Intervention and Prevention Program actually has any credentials.  If Ms. Purvis does not have credentials then there are going to be a lot of complications.

Thank you once again for your time, consideration, and patience.

Mr. Williams:
 
Per our phone conversation this morning regarding the transporting of my father Vicente Lopez, Sr. from Marshall Healthcare facility to Manor Care in St. Petersburg.  Once again I appreciate the urgency of the department wanting to St. Petersburg Florida by tomorrow at 1pm.  But, I am confused .  On Monday, February 17,2003 I received a called from Mrs. Sharon Leird from Jackranda , that she had received a called from Lisa Spike, manger of transportation of Medicare, that Jackranda had an opening for him there.  I am schedule to be at there facility today at 11am to view the facility.
 
Today, I received your call stating that Manor Care has also accepted and you all transfer to Manor Care tomorrow.
 
I will view both facility today and will call back to you and give which I will accept.  Per your request I will call you back after your lunch approximately 1pm today.
 
Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.

Dear Governor,

Importance: High


Benji,

Now that I have had a few moments to concentrate, I am focusing on getting
things ready to host a Workshop for the Mexicans that were at your meeting 
in St. Petersburg.  You'll recall that our mutual friend from USF was highly 
critical that nothing in the past had been going on with the subcommittee.   
Anyway, let's try to aggressively change that dynamic.  The
Mexicans (particularly the interests from Vera Cruz) have a focus on
specific remote sensing environmental data that I believe we can get for
them.  Additionally, we need to effectively bring together the efforts
to track and monitor Red Tides....I know we can do that as well.

My office is prepared to host a workshop with all of the major
players (e.g., NASA, EPA, NOAA, NAVY and the Mexican counterparts).  We
have begun efforts to secure meeting space, interpreters, etc. for early
May in New Orleans.  What I need to pull this off with great success is
simply to obtain an official request. Whether it is from the FL State 
Department, the Governor's Office or you as Chair of that Committee, 
I'll leave up to you.  I simply need the formal impetus to press on and 
hit a homerun for everyone involved.

Attached to this e-mail is a draft letter requesting assistance.  Call me 
when you get the chance and I'll fill in any missing blanks for you.

Thanks for your help in giving us the opportunity to help Florida
and the greater partnership of the Accord.

                                          Bryon

(See attached file: Workshop Request (Draft).rtf)

_____________________________________________________________
Historical material related to this request - Benji Brumberg

I was asked to attend the Gulf of Mexico States Accord by the Florida
Department of State. I was asked to facilitate the Health, Ecology and
Environment workshop and serve in other capacities, as well.( see e-mail
below) After consulting with DEP's Inter Governmental Programs Office, we
decided I should accept the invite and also might be appropriate to ask DOS
if we could invite a representative from EPA's Gulf of Mexico States Program
to attend the Gulf of Mexico States Accord (specifically, to participate in
the "Health, Ecology and Environmental workshop.)  Everyone agreed it would
be a good idea - and it produced a most important synergy.  The
representative was Bryon Griffith - the (most impressive) gentleman who
writes the request.

I am writing to request your attention to the proposed budget ammendment which will cut the funding for this very important program.
As both a mother of two school-aged children who wear glasses, and an employee of the Santa Rosa County School District, I certainly know of the need for corrective vision, especially in the classroom.  Fortunately, my husband and I are able to afford adequate vision care for our family.  Unfortunately, there are families in our communities who are not.  I am speaking out for those individuals, particularly the children who are a victim of their families' income.  Please keep this program intact.

Subject:	Deregulation of Talent Agents

Dear Governor Bush: 
       Upon learning of the effort to deregulate Talent Agents in the state of Florida, I am left in near shock. It is unthinkable that our legislators would even consider giving agents a license to do whatever they want. 
      Many of us in the business have worked many years to bring film and television integrity to Florida. This is a multibillion business in the state of Florida. We create no pollution and bring much needed revenue to businesses of many types. From insurance companies to gas stations, restaurants, stores of all kinds, hotels, car rentals and the list goes on and on. There are few industries that bring the kind of income to Florida that our industry does. 
      Some agents in the past have not been operated in an honest manner. It has taken some agents many years f to build a clientele and create a name for themselves. We must  maintain a posture of respectability and professionalism. Deregulation will do the opposite. Dishonest people will come streaming to Florida to take advantage of our citizens. It may tie the courts up far beyond what they are already dealing with. 
      Please do not make it easy for dishonest people who will find this an attractive way of bilking our hard working Floridians. We do not want to encourage scammers to come to Florida. You deregulate...THEY WILL COME! 

Sincerely,

Subject: Plese Reconsidder Dr. Williams' Appointment


Dear Governor Bush:
 
In 2002 a law was passed, Florida Statutes §1001.21, which created the Office of Private Schools and Home Education. The purpose of this office is to "serve the interests of students and the parents of students in private schools and home education programs." The office would be run by an executive director, one of whose duties is to "evaluate pending policy to ensure that the policy does not subject private schools and home education programs to additional regulation or mandates." 
 
I am more than a little concerned that your choice for the first executive director to this position, Dr. Alex Penn Williams. She is neither a home educator nor a private school administrator. Her expertise is in testing and accountability in the public school system. Public education and home education are as different as day and night. My concern is that, although Dr. Williams might well be a fine individual and great asset to the public education system, she is in no way qualified to understand and advocate for truly independent education. I ask you to reconsider her appointment to this office, and appoint someone whose credentials better mesh with home education and private schools.
 
Very sincerely yours,

Dear Governor Bush:

    Mr. A.J. McMullian, retirement system director has denied me teaching 
service     for all ten years of teaching service under Chapter 238, Florida 
Statutes.  He has had one last chance to change his wrongful decision, which 
has reduced my legal pension for ten years service in the Teachers Retirement 
System and twelve years service in the Florida Retirement System from 
$1,043.33 to $829.27.  This decision was and is in violation of my rights and 
benefits legally preserved in Chapters 238 and 121 of the Florida Statutes 
and in Florida Administrative Code Annotated.
    On June 7, 1997, I retired from Volusia County Schools and received July 
1, 1997 as my retirement date from the Florida Retirement System.  Since July 
1, 1997, Mr. McMullian has cheated me $214.06 per month to begin with and the 
3% COLA and three years of credit for medical insurance at $15.00 per month.  
I have been insulted by his careless actions over the past three years and 
trust that now the Division of Retirement will correct my earned pension as 
intended by Florida Statutes and Florida Administrative Code.
    Could you arrange an appointment with me?  Thank you in advance for 
upholding the integrity of Florida retirement systems since 1952, when I 
began teaching at Lake Worth Senior High School in Lake Worth, Florida.

We had the opportunity to personally meet Miguel Estrada last December in Miami, Florida , while he was honored by Honduran Unity / Unidad Hondurena , and without question can tell you that we are proud and trust Miguel,  whom is a humble Honduran immigrant whom has worked very hard , is highly qualified, and has the desire to serve our court system which has considerable amount of backlog of cases and by all of us standing behind Mr. Estrada's  confirmation will enable it to become a diverse one specially for minorities.

Governor,

The Air Guard's "STARBASE" program, which is for "at risk" 4th-6th graders,
was recently reviewed by the Directorate of Youth Programs in the Nat'l
Guard Bureau. His evaluation placed this program at the top of the 28
StarBase programs across the country in the Air Guard.  We have made recent
changes to the support staff as recommend by an outside subject matter
expert.

As a consequence of the evaluation, we will soon receive between $125,000
and $200,000 in expand our facility at the F-15 fighter wing in
Jacksonville. This will allow us to bring on one more teacher and increase
student load....presently at 1,000 kids.

The program teaches Math, Science, and "coping" skills in a teamwork
environment. All federal dollars.  We graduate about 1,000 -1100 students
per year and receive about $225,000 in federal money.  All teachers are
certificated Duval County school teachers.

Because Senate Democrats are continuing their strategy to derail the confirmation of the President's judicial nominees.They have resorted to a FILIBUSTER to block the nomination of Miguel Estrada - - and it must be stopped!No longer are the Democrats stalling in the Senate Judiciary Committee, as they did for previous nominees.Now they are STALLING on the Senate floor! And excellent nominees, like Miguel Estrada, are being treated unjustly.Miguel Estrada should have been confirmed quickly to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. This is one of the most influential appellate courts in America.He has been given a well-qualified rating -- a unanimous decision -- by the American Bar Association.I believe he will be one of the most qualified appellate judges in America if he can be confirmed.I have known Miguel Estrada for a decade and I know he will be a superb federal appellate court judge, but I need your help.It is imperative that you contact both of your Senators immediately. Urge them to get the vote to the Senate floor. And ask them to vote to confirm Miguel Estrada as a judge in the Court of Appeals.If allowed to go to the floor, Senator Miller (Georgia) and Senator Breaux (Louisiana) have gone on record that they will vote for Miguel.Having a vote by the full Senate is the critical task ahead of us.Again, I urge you to call Sen. Graham at (202) 224-3041 and Sen. Nelson at (202) 224-5274 and politely say:Please quit delaying and immediately call for a vote for Miguel Estrada, and vote for his confirmation.It is important that YOU CALL RIGHT AWAY.

MARRIED COUPLES HONORED

Arnold and Phyllis Blacker, who live in Century Village East in
Deerfield
Beach, were given a very special Valentine's Day present from the state
of
Florida.

They were one of five couples selected from the entire state from
among
those married for 50 years or more, to be honored at a private dinner
hosted
by Governor Jeb Bush and his wife, Columba.

The event, which took place Thursday, Feb. 13, on Valentine's Day eve,
was
inspired by the Governor's stated goal of strengthening Florida's
families.
"These married couples are an incredible source of inspiration and
wisdom to
all of us," said Bush. "Their personal experiences, each spanning 50
years
or more, provide living examples of how to strengthen our families and
live
a more fulfilling life." 

Arnold Blacker credits the success of his marriage to having a sense
of
humor and the realization that "nothing is 100 percent happy happy.
It's not
Utopia, but you have to approach things with love. 

"The big problem with a lot of couples is money," he said. "People
want
everything yesterday. But you need breathing room. Material things
have
never been important to us. We buy what we can afford, and we don't
have any
bills. We were never rich rich, but we were happy."

Phyllis Blacker said that successful marriages are built on "a lot of
communication, and looking the other way on both sides," she said.
"Life is
not a bowl of cherries. There are a lot of pits along the way, and you
have
to get over it."

The Blackers regularly volunteer at the Northeast Focal Point. Their
names
were entered by Arlene Silk, Volunteer Coordinator, and chosen from
close to
40 other couples from South Florida.

They were particularly impressed with how warm, friendly, and
down-to-earth
the governor was, and how comfortable he made the guests feel.

"We had such a marvellous experience there," said Mrs. Blacker. "I told
the
governor how wonderful it was for him to do something like this, and I
hope
that in the future, more people would have the opportunity to
experience it
too. It was just a wonderful evening."

One of Governor Bush's goals is to bring Florida's families closer
together.
By honoring these five couples, whose time-tested marriages have been
built
on solid foundations, he hopes to encourage Floridians to make an
effort to
spend more time with their families, read to a child,
volunteer at a neighborhood school, or visit with an elderly neighbor.

He said he plans to make the Valentine's Day dinner an annual event.

Hello Jeb, I hope your trip to Spain went well. I wanted to write a few
words just to shine the light on an issue but first let me write something
regarding premonitions.

I don't know to what level I am blessed but I do know that I am. I tend to
have premonition of things and here is the latest example.

Yesterday, just as I was leaving my house for F.I.U where I teach in the
evening and as I always do, I looked for my kids to say good bye. I found my
daughter and looked into her beautiful eyes and I don't know why but I said
to her outloud-- "Krystal, don't forget to always protect your eyes. Be
careful with your eyes." Then I gave her a kiss and then also kissed my son
good bye. They are 5 and 3 1/2 respectively. Then, on my way to work and I
don't normally pray on my way to FIU, I decided to pray to God to please
protect my children specially since I am not home with them while I teach at
night. And then I asked to take care of all children over the world. Well,
about 15 minutes went by and I got a call on my cell phone from my wife. She
gives me some bad news. My kids fought over a pen and somehow my daughter
got poked in the eye and was bleeding. I could not believe what my wife was
telling me but knew it must be true. I asked her what she was doing that she
let it happen, she innocently said that she was cooking and she heard the
Microwave and she went to the kitchen and within seconds of turning her back
to the kids the accident happened. Anyway, I told her to take our daughter
to the emergency room to have the eye checked out. As you can imagine, I did
not have a very good lecture night since that is all I could think about.
Eventually, I spoke to my wife at the emergency room and she told me some
news somewhat bad and somewhat good. The good was that the pupil was not
harmed but the bad is that there was a minuscule puncture in the white part
of the eye. The doctors put anti-biotics in the eye and sent them home but
also recommended an eye doctor which they saw today. The news today was very
good and some of the eye had already healed. They did an eye test and she
came out with 20/20. She will still need anti-biotics for another week but
the doctor said there is basically no risk of eye problems now or in the
future. Well, as you can see again and again my faith in the Lord is
renewed. Why did I say what I said and why did it happen. Some say that the
evil one heard me and caused it to happen, others say that while it
occurred, it could have been worse and my daughter could have been blinded
for life but the divine intervened. I just thank the Lord that everything is
ok.

So back to premonitions, and while I was not going to say anything that is
to follow, I decided to since it is occurring during your brother's
administration, otherwise; I would let them learn their lesson. I want to
add that I know there is a fine line between being considered nutty,
delusional, etc and that is probably what they said about the Apostles,
Jesus and any other prophets so I can see the delicateness of it. I by no
means think I am God or anything close to it but I do think I am blessed.
These are two different things.

As such, I wanted to point out that there is a problem with the belly of the
Eagle which to me represents the Postal Service since I see the Eagle
everywhere as I am a contractor for the USPS. Currently the USPS is trying
to consolidate its Computer Service Support. As such, at some point it is
possible that I may be out of a job so I want to be upfront with this. This
new USPS policy is called CHD (Consolidated Help Desk) and ACE (Advanced
Computing Environment). Since I have to worry about my two kids and raising
them properly, I also have to worry about my job so I asked God to give me a
sign to see if CHD/ACE would be successful and he answered with one of the
worst Winter storms in years over the weekend. It was almost like if hell
froze over. It affected and shutdown all the CHD/ACE processes. I have
documentation provided from the thread below to show the extent. This is a
sign of what is to come when centralized technology is targeted by
terrorist, GOD or to add some mythology :-) --
Each time Persephone returns to Hades, Demeter hardens her heart and the
earth is wracked with bitter cold and harsh winds. According to myth of
course.

Nevertheless, Gods and premonitions aside, the facts speak for themselves. I
just hope the Administration is not what is backing this effort. I is doomed
to fail and millions will be lost.

Florida Ponders Fate of Historic 2000 Ballots

By DANA CANEDY



	

 M <http://graphics7.nytimes.com/images/dropcap/m.gif> IAMI, Feb. 13 - The contested 2000 presidential election has largely faded into people's hazy memories of pre-9/11 America. But the Florida ballots are still there, nearly six million punch cards and their chads, stowed in boxes, stacked on pallets, wrapped in plastic.

The state has kept them for two years, as federal law requires. Now that the time is up, a pressing question for state officials here is: What do we do with these things?

"How about a bonfire?" said Theresa LePore, the Palm Beach County supervisor of elections, who designed the butterfly ballots that led many Al Gore supporters to vote for Pat Buchanan.

For now, torching is not an option for Ms. LePore and her counterparts throughout the state. The local elections offices are responsible for storing ballots from their districts, but it is up to Florida's Division of Library and Information Services to determine which public records must be retained and for how long.

At a loss for what to do, the agency has extended the 22-month deadline for preserving ballots until June 30. Now the secretary of state's office is calling on Florida's lawmakers to step in and settle the matter when they meet next month.

Historians, lawyers and political science buffs are calling for Florida to preserve the ballots and other election materials indefinitely.

"This is the most controversial presidential election in modern history - an election that was viewed by the world for 36 days and ultimately decided by the Supreme Court," said Julian Pleasants, a history professor at the University of Florida in Gainesville. "It's an important series of events that should be saved for future generations."

Mr. Pleasants would also keep all election-related e-mail, copies of instructions from supervisors to poll workers, absentee ballots, records of canvassing board meetings and legal briefs.

Arguments like these are enough to make Ms. LePore and other elections officials shudder. They say they simply do not have the space to indefinitely retain the immense amount of paper generated by the 2000 election. If state lawmakers ultimately decide to preserve the documents, the officials say, they are welcome to them.

"We as well as other larger counties are tight on space, and they do take up an awful lot of room," Ms. LePore said.

Generally, ballots and other public documents are kept for about two years and then sent to a paper processing company for shredding. Florida and other states do at times retain public records for much longer, just as the state did in recent years with documents related to lawsuits brought by smokers against tobacco companies.

"For the most part, ballots don't have historical value, but obviously 2000 was a bit different," said Ken Detzner, Florida's acting secretary of state. "We find it appropriate that the Legislature weigh the question of whether these records should be kept." Jenny Nash, a spokeswoman for Mr. Detzner, said his office was drafting correspondence to formally ask the Legislature to intervene.

Yet some state legislators have already said they have other priorities. The subject of the ballots "hasn't come up on our radar screen," said Mike Hogan, a Republican state representative from Jacksonville who is chairman of the House subcommittee on ethics and elections.

As a result, the June 30 deadline may well pass with no action by lawmakers, leaving the state's 67 supervisors of election, the official custodians of the ballots, to decide what should become of them.

The options include sending the ballots to the paper processor to be shredded, preserving a representative sampling, and preserving all of them. That third choice, however, would require even more decision making by state officials.

They would have to decide whether to leave the documents spread across the state in the custody of local elections offices, transfer them to the state archives department for safekeeping in a huge storage facility, or donate them.

By law, the ballots cannot be donated after the expiration date for retaining them, so even if the Florida lawmakers wanted to give some or all of them to the Smithsonian Institution or a law school, such a move would require action by the Legislature, said Barratt Wilkins, who sent the letter to the elections officials ordering the extended deadline before he retired in January as director of the state's Division of Library and Information services. The ballots cannot be sold, however, so one place they are not likely to end up is on eBay, state officials say.

Mr. Barratt, whose job for more than 25 years was to keep up with public documents, said he saw little value in retaining the ballots. "We heard from historians around the country," he said. "My own feeling is the record has been compromised simply because they have been handled so many times and the chads have fallen out."

Mr. Pleasants, the history professor, served on a committee appointed by the Florida State Association of Supervisors of Elections last year to discuss what to do with records. The committee did not come up with a definitive solution. 

The secretary of state's office estimates that it will cost $250,000 to move and store the documents and $100,000 annually after that.

"I understand both the space and economic cost," Mr. Pleasants said. "I can see it will be a burden in a time of economic downturn. But from a historical perspective, to be able to understand the history of the state, people who study this in the future would need these documents."

The president's brother, Gov. Jeb Bush, was noncommittal. "We're still studying the matter," said Alia Faraj, a spokeswoman for the governor. "We're trying to evaluate the historical value of the ballots and weigh that in with the cost of keeping them. We may seek to engage the Legislature in this issue."

And what does Katherine Harris think? Ms. Harris, the secretary of state who declared George W. Bush the winner of Florida's 25 decisive electoral votes, and who was later elected to the House of Representatives, is staying out of this one. She issued a statement through a spokesman: 

"Congresswoman Harris considered this matter while she was still serving as secretary of state. She determined that the Florida Legislature was best suited to strike the balance between the historic value of these ballots and the financial cost of their retention. Thus, she directed the Department of State's Bureau of Archives and Records Management to extend the mandatory retention period for these ballots to give the Legislature sufficient time to consider this issue during its 2003 session."

    As the administrator of a private school in Polk County and a long time supporter of the governor, I am very disappointed that you would choose Dr. Williams as the executive director over private schools and home education programs. 
    As  a "homeschooling" parent, I had hoped for leadership from a long list of qualified candidates who have dedicated their lives to parent directed education, not publicly funded schools.
    While I believe charter schools are a step in the right direction for the public school system, we have chosen not to be a part of that system. We appreciate the office which has been created by law to protect our rights, and  we want the executive director of this office to be someone who has legitimate knowledge of, and interest in, these rights. The Office of Private Schools and Home Education was established, in statute, to assure our autonomy, independence, and non-governmental status.
    Please reconsider this decision; thousands of homeschooling families and families in private schools are now very uncomfortable.

They also attached a report that was sent to the state-on this very same portable-that claimed the portable meet safety requirements.  It seems to me that this was a deliberate misrepresentation of the facts!
You did not mention this in your email.  The parents of  the Lee County school district want someone to be held accountable and responsible for the ongoing lies and misrepresentations by the district and it's staff.

Dear Ms. McGrath, 
Thank you for your recent correspondence to the Governor regarding the safety conditions of portable classrooms in the Lee County School District.  Your correspondence has been forwarded to me for reply.

School safety has been a priority issue for the Governor for several years which is why legislation has been adopted during his administration to address issues relating to teacher, principal, school board, and superintendent authority; enforcement of attendance; zero tolerance policies; victim rights; and standards for portable classrooms.  Included in last year's rewrite of Florida's school code that Governor Bush signed into law are provisions that attempt to ensure the use of adequate classrooms in school districts.  More specifically, the law requires the Department of Education to annually conduct onsite reviews of certain educational facilities for each school district that submits a survey of its educational facilities to the Department of Education.  If after conducting an onsite review, the Department of Education determines that a school district inaccurately reported information in its survey of educational facilities, the Commissioner of Education may ultimately decide to withhold future state funds for educational facilities from the school district.

After speaking with staff from the Department of Education's Office of Educational Facilities, it appears that the Lee County School District is presently working with the Office in order to enhance the safety conditions of its portable classrooms.  We will continue to work with the Office of Educational Facilities to ensure that every portable classroom in your school district complies with state standards.  Again, thank you for keeping the Governor informed about the safety of students in the Lee County School District.                   

Sincerely, 
Daniel Furman                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Education Policy Chief

Dear Governor Bush, 
I wrote to you over the summer regarding the problems this district was having in regards to start times and late buses. You were gracious enough to respond-but told me that this was a "local" issue. During the last few months we have continued to have a large number of late buses due to this change in transportation, and many students are suffering. It has been my opinion all along that there is something very funny going on in the management of this district. Unfortunately, I think I was right! 

I just wanted to bring these news stories to your attention now. It appears that the situation in this school district has gotten completely out of hand. The Superintendent and his staff not only "duped" the entire community when they promised a savings of 1.5 million from the new bus schedule-OPPAGA has now showed us there was never a savings to be had-but now has put students at risk with the use of unsafe portables, and mis-reported information to the state in order to continue receiving $$ for these portables. 

I hope at this time you will see fit to send someone to investigate these problems.

Party People In The Place To Be,
            
The newly-appointed Office of Homeland Security is sure experiencing
some uncomfortable growing-pains.  Why, just yesterday, this neophyte
addition to the Federal government was lambasted publicly by ruthless
glamour-queen/washed-up comedienne, Joan Rivers.
            
As part of Oliver Stone's latest documentary on the life of the
entertainer, entitled tentatively as, "CAN WE TALK?: JOAN RIVERS AND HER
BIG, COSMETICALLY-ENHANCED HORSE-HEAD," Mrs. Rivers (if you're nasty)
was filmed ripping Tom Ridge and the whole Office of Homeland Security a
new one while drunk at her nephew's bris!:
            
{"Oh, my GOD!  Who was the genius who came up with the whole color
scheme gimmick?  Primary colors are so Crayola... it makes me want to
gifilta all over my ganectagazoid!  For the love of God, why not try
using colors that are a little MORE 'Todd Oldham' and a little LESS
'Mork from Ork'!  Taupe could mean, 'They [terrorists] might attack
today, they might attack tomorrow... I'm supposed to cancel my nail
appointment for this?!?' and ochre could mean, 'If there's an attack
today, don't say we didn't warn you."}
            
In their defense, it is quite a task to run an operation who's main
function is to preempt the unpredictable.  It's like living on a
fault-line in a perpetual state of panic, so when the BIG ONE finally
hits, you're amply prepared.  It's tough when your intelligence sources
are smarmy rogues that would be imprisoned in most civilized societies
and would probably be spying for Al-Qaeda, if only they had a more
appealing benefits package than inheriting 72 virgins in the afterlife.

That's a death sentence for most guys!
            
Having little to do, besides throwing pencils into the cork,
drop-ceiling panels in the office and perfecting their "click and drag"
techniques on the Internet, employees at the Office of Homeland Security
have been mandated by "G.Dubya" to find something to do... and fast.
            
As a reaction to the recent incident that occurred at a southside
Chicago night-spot, where 21 people were killed in a stampede, prompted
by irresponsible patrons screaming that there was a terrorist threat
inside the club, Tom Ridge, Director of Homeland Security, is following
a new directive that calls for close surveillance on clubs and lounges
across the country that attract vast amounts of people.
            
Surprise, surprise...

We here at the MINISTRY OF CULTURE, Inc., were issued a formal letter,
warning us that FUACATA! was NUMBER ONE on the government's "hit-list."
            
Unfortunately, and against our wishes, the Office of Homeland Security
(God, I'm tired of writing that down) has issued a Federally-mandated
set of rules and regulations that will become effective TONIGHT.
            
We hate to do it, but here they are:
            
1) Any wearing of turbans or like-headwear and any riding of dromedaries
(Arabian Camels) is strictly prohibited.

2) The use of the word 'Allah', when referring to the God of Islam, or
when saying things like, "Boy, there's nothing like a cup of coffee and
some apple pie 'Allah' mode, is cause for a cavity search.

(We have a back room all set up for that)
            
3) Men wearing unkempt, gnarly beards will be subject to an on-site,
humiliating shave with a rusty butter knife, administered by Fernando,
our dough-eyed bouncer.
            
4) Women wearing unkempt, gnarly beards will be shipped off to Hungary,
where they will be forced to work in a travelling, gypsy circus.

5) Refrain from describing the music of The Spam Allstars as "The Bomb."
            
We here at the MINISTRY OF CULTURE, Inc., fully realize that it will
take your cooperation to make these rules stick and for the future of
OUR party to be secured.
            
We have faith in every one of you that you will comply with these
regulations, with the dignity and grace you are known for the world
over!
            
Party on, Garth!!!

RE:  Recommendation of Gary Kozan for Plumbing Position on Florida Building Commission

Dear Governor Bush:
As a long time member of the Florida Association of Plumbing Heating Cooling Contractors, also known as the FAPHCC, I am pleased to support Gary W. Kozan for appointment to the plumbing position on the Florida Building Commission. 
Gary has served for several years on the Plumbing Technical Advisory Committee of the Florida Building Commission.  He is one of the most knowledgeable individuals on plumbing and code issues in the state.  He, no doubt would be able to "hit the ground running" since he is completely "up to speed" on the plumbing code.
Mr. Kozan has been in the plumbing business for over 30 years.  He's held his certified plumbing license since 1981 and is the successful owner of a plumbing business which has more than 200 employees. 
He has served on the Palm Beach County Building Code Advisory Board for a decade and served for 6 years on the Broward County Plumbing Technical Committee.  Since 2002, he has been a member of the International Plumbing Code Committee.  In addition to being an active member of FAPHCC, he is a member of the American Society of Plumbing Engineers (ASPE), American Society for Sanitary Engineering  (ASSE), and the Southern Building Code Congress International (SBCCI).
To sum this up, his experience, interests and willingness to serve make him a most qualified candidate for the plumbing position on the Florida Building Commission.  I respectfully request you give him your consideration in this appointment.
Sincerely,  Kirk Vail
President, Vail Plumbing, Inc.

Importance: High


Jim Dwyer - regarding appraisals of property purchased by the state - WHY ARE THEY APPRAISING FUTURE VALUE? It's highly speculative, and can NOT be documented. The instructions to the appraisers, and the disclaimers in their reports, should be most revealing. State agencies should be relying on present values only - as would any private sector buyer. Would Jeb Bush pay for the future development's value a parcel of land for warehouse purposes!? The rule of thumb we use, in my company, is the future (value) belongs to the buyer, and you NEVER pay a seller for that. Stick to your guns. You are right! What would solve some problems would be to remove from inexperienced state bureaucrats the decisions regarding assumptions and instructions to appraisers OR write out step-by-step policies which they must use, and the Cabinet should be using those policies to determine whether or not a proposed purchase is done properly. Instead of finger pointing, and blame, the Cabinet should be managing! Sheila Anderson

I am going to now ask you for a favor.   I need a job.  I went on My Florida and looked at the  list ,but they are very limited.  I need to be in Tallahassee to  be available to  the  County concerning the permitting of my property in Bradfordville,  I simply do not have the money to go back and forth from Orlando to Tallahassee to  tend to everything.   Last year when I was in the Leon County Republican Headquarters as the full time volunteer, I lived in a substandard situation.   I need to take better care of myself so I will have to go to work, with a paying job.  I have done more volunteering in  and for campaigns than most  anyone.  I am very versatile, I can do many things, and I am willing to do most anything.  I would be happy being a receptionist, a phone  counselor, a gopher (which I am very good at)   I ask about working in your area, because frankly for me, that would make life very pleasant.  I will always be reliable and hard working.  I learn quickly and so far in my 66 years, I haven't had a job I couldn't do.    You may ask Ed DePuy about my dedication and ability.  He has seen my diligence in getting my Environmental Permit from Leon County on my  Bradfordville property.  I even  made it through the "Historical Privy Revue"   I suspect with your background, you know  what an undertaking this is. Hope you can give me some direction.  Thank you so much.

Subject: Transportation Updates


Hi Jeb,
   Wanted to update you on recent trucking legislation that the commission
is supporting. After much deliberation with the Fla Trucking Association, I
think I have built a repor with Bud Colemen going, which you may know
represents Guy Bostik's firms here in Florida. I have convinced him to use
the commission as an advocate instead of an adversary. They have agreed to
allow stiff penalties for repeat violators that step up from first a
warning, to a $5,000 fine, then to a 25k fine,then to enjoin them from
operating. I think Mr. Coleman understands that stiffer penalties deter an
operators from not fixing a defective piece of equipment, and will make the
roads safer buy keeping those that don't want to invest in running safe
equipment or breaking hours of service laws of the streets. Because of a
quirk in the law, Intrastate MCCO Inspectors have not been able to do a
Compliance Review at a Hazmats companies headquarters, only if they pulled
them over on the road. There was in essence, no effective intrastate reviews
going on. This will change now and allow inspectors to go into a company and
review their logbooks(another weak area in Fla) and see if drivers  hauling
hazardous materials are trained and licensed to haul what they are
hauling(Only Feds could do this until now).
   We were to start a Blue Ribbon panel to deal with how hours of service of
drivers contributes to the high heavy truck crash rate (which is up 17%),
but new Fed rules are expected to be out in April, that are not to far off
from our Intrastate rules and our hope is that the FTA will go along with
combining them so we get the $1.4 mil we are loosing every year for not
compiling with Fed Interstate Trucking rules. This will also bring the
logbook requirement down from 200 mile to the 100 Federal standard.
I was waiting to hear from your staff to meet but never did, so sent this
E-Mail. By the way we the 3 names Dave Brown gave to you for Secretary of
DOT have a very diverse backround. I don't personally see how an outsider
can get up to speed on how our state works in time before he leaves
office,as other commission members feel,but we all feel Jose Abreu should be
the choice.
He has a passion for the job and think he will bring new energy to the
Department. Hope to see you soon,Warmest regards, Bob Namoff.

Hello Governor, 

WDBO is trying to come to Tallahassee for a morning show broadcast.  We would prefer to do it the day that Glenda Hood is sworn in as Secretary of State --- if you can be available to be one of our live guests.  We can do 5 minutes, 10 minutes, or up to an hour for you to talk about the issues that you feel are important to the state.  If you cannot be available that day we will come to Tallahassee on a day you can be available if you can join us for an hour of "Ask the Governor".  Maybe you'll be a radio talk show host after your second term.  Can we set this up?

Now the request for help.  WDBO is on a list of 44 organizations being considered by the Florida National Guard to send a reporter to be with our Florida National Guard troops in the Middle East.  We would send Jeff Marshall who is one of our best reporters.  Our request is on the desk of Lt. Col Ron Tittle, Chief of Public Affairs with the Florida National Guard in St. Augustine.  If you could put in a good word for us I have a feeling it will go a long way.  Thanks.

Please let us know if we can help you in any other way.

Jeb, the board of trustees for Maimonides University, of which I am a board member, has decided to give the Governor of Sicily, Salvatore Cuffaro, an honorary degree.  He has graciously agreed to accept, and we are working on a time with his office to have him come to South Florida to receive the honor.  We are planning the event sometime within the dates of June 8th through June 12th of this year.  We would be honored if you could attend the event.  Maimonides University, which is a Jewish seminary school headed by the Chief Rabbi of Sicily, Dr. Stefano Di Mauro, has locations in Sicily, Miami and Israel.  Rabbi Di Mauro, who has a home in Florida, and the board believe that this would be a wonderful opportunity to bring together the Floridian, Italian and Jewish communities.  This is especially the case considering the fact that Governor Cuffaro just signed a groundbreaking agreement to generate business between Sicily and Israel through the Chamber of Commerce Sicily-Israel.  Please tell me if you are available and when.  We would like to work out a time when both you and Governor Cuffaro would be able to attend the event together.
 
Be well.

I have been traveling, so I have not been able to contact you with my appreciation. You made the right choice – and I will make sure you are confident of that during the next few years. 
 
I am a local supporter of your efforts and work closely with Mary McCarty, Fran Hancock, Sid Dinerstein, Tom Derita, Bud Paxson, and so many other supporters of your Administration. I am also closely linked with Bobby Polito who runs the Faith Based office under Secretary Thompson at HHS in DC, Jim Towey’s office, Bernie DeCastro here in Florida, and many other supporters of the Faith Based Initiative. 
 
As a young conservative focusing my efforts within the most-often liberal world of human services, my passion and desire has always been to prove that true conservatism can be and most-often is compassionate. I don’t believe in the failed social policies of the left. They have had their chance to engineer society – and they have failed.
 
I realize this is just the beginning and there is quite a bit of work to do. However, together, we are proving that “the church” should and can make a meaningful and lasting difference in the lives of hurting people. And, we can do this without ever losing our identity. 
 
Place of Hope is the most unique and powerful example of what the faith based community can do in partnership with the community and government. We are doing it – and lives are being changed. These facts can not be denied.
 
I hope to make positive strides within the CSC arena and our community as a whole. Also, I have been asked by Secretary Regier to speak at the upcoming DCF Community-Based Care conference at the end of this month (as a faith-based organization in child welfare). I’m thankful for this opportunity as well. I am available to assist your Administration as needed – Please just ask. 
 
 Finally, feel free to provide your thoughts, direction, and input as we move forward.
 
I would love to provide you with a tour of our Paxson Campus and homes at your convenience.
 
Blessings and thanks.
 
Charles L. Bender III

Subject: MY BROTHER THE INVESTMENT BANKER


JEB: I have in the past mentioned to you my older brother Roman. In fact he told me that last year at the Alfalfa dinner he went up to you and said hello, along, I am sure, with several other hundred or so people. Unlike his wayward younger brother -- the trial lawyer, you will be happy to hear that my brother is a businessman who actually helps create wealth and jobs for others. He is an investment banker. After 32 years at Lehmans Brothers he decided last month to announce that he was leaving the firm to avail himself of its retirement benefits now that he has reached the young age of 55.   
 
Roman has done exceptionally well for himself and is now looking for new professional and civic opportunities to pursue. In the past he had indicated an interest in giving something back to our wonderful adopted country through some sort of public service - whether full time or otherwise. His brilliant son, my godchild in fact, is now working in the Bush Administration in the Defense Department, after having graduated summa cum laude from Harvard and finishing a Gates Scholarship at Cambridge. I introduced him to you briefly one day during your first transition.    
 
I am attaching my brother's resume in the hope that you may forward it to The White House in the event that they may take a look at it to see whether there may be some interest in him to contribute in some capacity to our beloved country.
 
I can assure you that he is completely compatible, and then some, with the policies and philosophy of The White House. He also happens to be a good man, who has a terrific family, and who can play golf much, much better than me.
 
Thanks! 
 
P.S. I hope that you have enjoyed your trip to Spain. It was great to see a photograph of yourself shaking the hand of the Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar. Our allies need to be acknowledged at a time like this. Please keep me in mind if you are planning another trip to Chile.

I was looking for money as usual and came across the MacArthur
Foundation.
They have a special interest in developing partnerships and funding
programs in Southeast Florida and Chicago for regional Policy and
Practice.
Chicago got a number of grants, none that I could find for Florida.
Their
website is www.macfound.org . With our shortfall of funds we need to
strengthen our grants programs and capitalize on money designated for
Florida's use.
Maybe there would be interest for our GALP initiative or for a program
where individuals are helped when they are having a particular tough
time
to keep them off the rolls of public assistance ( obviously my personal
interests). Anyway, wanted to point you in their direction. Maybe they
would assist in funding the foreign trade zone in Miami.
Keep up the great work!

Dear Governor Bush,

It has been brought to our attention that Dr. Alex Penn Williams has been
hired to oversee the Office of Non-Public and Home Education.

 We want you to know we are very concerned that a person who is only
experienced and qualified for,  and therefore limited to and biased toward,
public school education will be overseeing private and home education.

We urgently request that you protect the autonomy and independence of the
Office of Non-Public and Home Education which previously had
non-governmental status.  Please protect our rights and privileges we enjoy
as home educators.

Thank You,

Subject: Consider the Faith-Based DOC funding



Dear Gov. Bush,

       I'm writing to plea for the continuing funding for the faith-based substance abuse transitional housing contract for the Department of Corrections. I understand that the funding has been eliminated from your budget for this contract. 

       To refresh your memory, this contract is the first of its kind which allows state prisoners to choose a "faith-based" substance abuse program upon release from prison. The contract was only awarded last April and Fresh Start Ministries is an awardee of the contract. We have been helping recovering men addicts in the Orlando area for almost 17 years, very successfully, I might add. We have a 45 bed facility, but we only bid on 10 DOC beds. We wanted to "test the waters" and we have been very pleased with the results.

       As you know, the faith-based agenda has only begun to take off this past year with the great leadership of you and your brother, the President. If it weren't for the strong beliefs in your family, these political statements would not have survived. Luckily the faith-based initative has been making a STRONG impact on those from prison who are under the DOC faith-based contract & who ARE getting help through our year-long program. However, we haven't had enough time to produce the statistics to validlly reflect the impact we are making. 

       Today, you are at a crossroad in deciding how best to expend limited resources to deal with one of the state's most pressing public health problems. The good news is that an extensive body of Federally-funded research shows that, with treatment, very large decreases in drug use and criminal activity are experienced, while financial self-sufficiency improves. (e.g., employment increases & welfare recipients decrease).
       
       I realize that you have cuts to make and maybe this funding can somehow be streamlined or otherwise made workable. Please reconsider the impact on the bottom-line of the state if we don't begin producing productive, life-changed citizens from our prisons. 

       In closing, please allow me to give you a couple of statistics about the COST of missing this treatment:

1.  The social cost of drug & alcohol treatment in the US is estimated at $294 billion per year in lost productivity & costs associated with law enforcement, health care, justice, welfare & other program & services. (R.M. Coffey PhD, National Estimates of Expenditures for Substance Abuse Treatment 1997. Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, US Dept. of Health & Human Services, Medstat Grp, 2/01)

2.  Conservative estimates note that for every $1 invested in addiction treatment, there is a return of between $4 & $7 in reduced drug-related crime, criminal justice costs and theft. When savings related to health care are included, total savings can exceed costs by a ratio of 12 to 1. (Principles of Drug Addiction Treatment: A Research-Based Guide. NIH Publication No. 00-4180. Bethesda MD, Nat'l Institutes of Health, National Institute on Drug Abuse, reprinted 7/00.)

Thank you, Mr. Governor for your time in reading and considering this request and please know that we pray for you and your family so that you might have wisdom for your leadership position in our state and in our nation, that you & your family may have good health and peace.

In His Service,

Kevin, if you can't pass the FCAT, you can continue on with your education. The key is to pass the FCAT 10th grade test which you can take 6 times to graduate. Don't you think that this is fair? The FCAT test is a measurement of the Sunshine Skills Standards for each grade level. It is a fair test of knowledge. You can do it!

Dear Jeb,

I am wrighting this to you because I am concerned about the FCAT. I like what you have done and everything and I think that you are a good governor but you should think about what you are doing about the FCAT think about for a minute. I live in Alachua County and about 12,000 kids failed the FCAT last year. My name is Kevin Cruce and I failed it about 2 times I am not wrighting this to you to complain or anything no its not like that you see they made it harder than from 8 th grade I pasted that one but I am a really bad test taker and if you just make everybody pass the FCAT and people still fail it then you are really putting people down about them selves I mean we just did not go to school for 13 years and just let the FCAT say if we pass or not its not fair. If you think about it if kids in the Alachua County don't pass the FCAT then you will have kids with no diplomas and just a letter saying you went to school. It's 2003 its hard to have no diplomas now days. And you will have so many kids unemployment and dropouts it would not be even funny. What If your brother George Bush decided to make everybody to pass the FCAT to get a diploma on the standards of what you what I grantee that there would be a lot of lawsuits against the United States. But he has not done that but Florida has. My prediction is that there will be lawsuits against Florida and then Florida will change the FCAT. 

Sincerely,

Kevin Cruce

Governor, I had the opportunity to review an  on-line system system that helps kids with their homework. The program is for 
designed for  grades 4-12 and provides instant access to  teachers who are are expert in various subject areas. My understanding is that
the Leon County Public Library is purchasing this system and it will be available for free to any child who is a member of the Library.
Basically kids type in questions they need help in into a computer and a teacher responds and assists. The program also has the
capability of having  teachers  review papers/reports  for grammar, spelling ( a big problem for me ), content etc that kids prepare prior to 
their turning the assignment in. All the teachers that participate are certified, and there is an on-going quality monitoring system. I read some 
of the evaluations by the students about the help they were receiving and the responses were excellent The program begins at 2:00 PM.
and ends at 1:00 AM every day.
 
Governor I don’t know about you and Mrs Bush, but my wife Joanne and I had problems assisting Brian and Greg with homework assignments  
when they got to geometry, calculus, trig, physics etc. I could teach the boys how to hit the curve ball, but chemistry was a killer. I gotta tell you, 
this program can provide much needed assistance to kids and their parents. I thought you might be interested in learning about it
because of your personal commitment to mentoring and the “techy” that you are. I liken this to “electronic mentoring”.
 
Sir, I think you would really be impressed with this. I know how busy you are,  but if you had 20-30 minutes I think it would be time well spent 
to view the system . I AM NOT INVOLVED IN THIS AT ALL. I just believe this has tremendous potential. The name of the company is Tutor.com
and operates out of New York. I have to tell you  the person who demonstrated the system to me is Chris Kearney who is Kate Kearney’s brother. 
If you were I interested in a demonstration, any of their officers could come down and do it.
 
To me this would be much more helpful to kids than class size.
 
Sorry to take your valuable time, I just was really impressed with the possibilities this program has in helping kids.
 
Governor, I hope you have a great day

My name is Theresa Kennedy Missbach.  I lived in Florida for 25 years.  My daughter went to high school and college in Florida.  My husband and I moved to Las Vegas, Nevada because my husband had a wonderful job offer. My husband passed away in 2001 and I moved back to my wonderful state of Florida where all my family lives.  I love it here. 

STATE OF FLORIDA:
State should encourage retirees to come to Florida ( the News Journal )
Why? What is here? 

No mass bus transit to get disabled people and seniors around to stores and doctors from and to their homes. Florida needs to start focusing on what people need for activities:

A.  Senior's need to have activities so they can function and be productive in later years of life.
B.  Senior's are wonderful people.
C.  Need Casino's - so that people will have something to do in Florida.  Go to movies, eat in beautiful restaurants, see beautiful shows, great bingo halls and gamble and have fun in life.  They DO NOT have this in Florida.  Yes, they do have Car Races twice a year, Bikes twice a year, college group twice a year, but to clean up the mess cost the taxpayers too much.  So, please let me know? is that all Florida has to offer?  We need more than that for the state of Florida.  Florida needs good schools, not crowed classrooms.  If you make the classrooms smaller in size, you will need to build more classrooms and that means more money.   Florida will need MORE REVENUE   - so why not casino's that bring in all the REVENUE into Florida not busing people out to different states to gamble and spend there money in other states.  Bus people to Florida for a change, to see beautiful casino's that people might consider moving to this beautiful State of ours.  Please put this on the BALLOT.  Florida could bring the young and the old into this state.  There would be Job Opportunities for all, if you have CASINO'S.   PEOPLE NEED TO WORK!!    WHY NOT HAVE AN OPINION POLL FOR THE PEOPLE IN FLORIDA.TO VOTE

Why is it, that people from Chicago, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, the Carolina's move to Nevada, because there is so much to do in the state of Nevada.  
.
1.  Nevada has enough Bus transportation 
2.  Pickup Disabled people and Senior's at their homes. Take them to doctors, stores, grocery shopping and to the casino's. 
3.  Florida could have all this too.  What are we waiting for?

This might be in vain, but I'm trying every avenue to help my daughter.  Lane is a 22 year old, living in Panama City, Florida at the moment.  I live in Auburn, Alabama, where Lane grew up.  Lane has had several diagnosis over the years, different doctors, different opinions and different labels...bipolar, oppositional defiant, mood swing disorder, anxiety disorder, ADD, borderline personality disorder...i haven't been able to help her.  She seems to be misusing prescription drugs one way or the other and I'm not sure what else.  She is basically homeless; she can't live with me for several reasons--I have temporary custody of her 3 year old and the court has taken away visitation rights until she helps herself.  However, she isn't.  She is getting worse--and I want to help her.  But mental health in Alabama says that because she is an adult she has to want help and seek it on her own or she has to be actually a threat to herself or another when evaluated; therefore she keeps slipping through the system, as she has shown some control when necessary.  Many of her behaviors are manipulative and disruptive; it's hard for me as a mother to distinguish between disorder/manipulative behavior at times--for I'm told different things at different times.  She can be very verbally abusive and also has a history of being physically abusive. She stole checks from me and took things and I have no money, nor the funds to seek advice from professionals outside the area mental health.  I've been advised to have her arrested on forged checks, letting the system take over instead of me at this point; however, my point is not to have her sit in jail, slipping through more time; my point is to have her issues addressed and dealt with so she can live a more productive, happy life.  How can your mental health experts help her in Florida.  Lane does not see that she has a problem; she blames everyone around her and everyone makes her miserable.  I brought her up with Christian principles; however, I can not make her love the Lord and see her ways; in fact, she hates God for making her the way she is.  She is way out of control and I need to seek help for her.  Is there any way to have her picked up and evaluated for a maybe a week with no drugs in her system to help her perform and go from there as what truly all is wrong with her.  I've been advised for my well being to let her go; but I can't stop seeking answers and a better way.  I release her to God; but she is crying out for help; she just doesn't know she needs it (she thinks she just needs money to live on--by me--and she never seems to hold down a job for an extended time.)  And because I have her child, she is very angry at me and is twisting the truth in her mind that I don't love her.  I love her and want to hold her accountable for her actions but I'm just not sure what she should be accountable for.  And I don't want to enable and keep this crisis going on.  I fear for her life or others when she is at her very worst.  Is there any way you or your mental health experts can help me or talk me through this with any better options than having her picked up on forgery charges and going from there.  She will hate me forever for this and I am truly the only one that really loves her; but I don't want my love for her to stand in her way of getting help.

Can you help me in any way?

Dear Honorable Governor Jeb Bush,
I am feeling so helpless and I feel I need to at least vent my feelings somewhere.  I have been following an issue concerning one of Florida's most famous natural wonders.  It involves a local lawyer who sees an opportunity on a lifetime.  You see, he wants to withdraw 100,000 gallons of spring water daily for sale as bottled water.  
I live within 8/10's of a mile of this glorious natural spring .  Now we have read that the local government (Marion County Commission) and the St. John's River Water Management District have struck some type of a deal to allow this "business" man to come online with the local utility and then sell the water to the public as bottled water.  Governor Bush, I know where the wells are for this utility, way too close to the springs.  I feel personally that this may pose a direct threat to the springs as we know them today.  There have been no studies done on this spring, "Silver Springs" to establish whether or not mass withdrawal will effect it negatively or not.  I am extremely concerned and I am hoping you might be at least a little concerned as well.  PLEASE, see what you can do to stop this business man from selling the life blood of the residents here in Silver Springs.  Any and all of your help will be most graciously appreciated.
Sincerely Yours,

Dear Friends,
                      The newly appointed Charter Schools Appeal Commission met this month for their first meeting which was primarily organizational.  The Commission has recommended guidelines for appeals and denials of charter schools.  Yesterday, The Florida Board of Education adopted those guidelines at their meeting in Jacksonville. We have attached the guidelines for your review.  
 
Great news for all schools:  The new Annual Report Wizard is now available on the following website:  www.FloridaLEADS.com <http://www.floridaleads.com/>   A great tool to assist operators to creat  the Annual Report.  It is easy to use and you can upload images to your report. 

Please make sure that you read the attached article Yellow Flag by Brunno Manno a national leader in the charter school movement.

Attention all charter schools:  Please check your and make sure you have a your emergency plans up to date and your parents informed of your plan.  If you need help, this website will help:  http://www.broward.k12.fl.us/safetydept/

As a reminder, all charter schools need to have in place a working Emergency Preparedness Safety/Security Plan  Please note that this falls under health and safety school laws that charter schools HAVE to follow.

The Florida Charter School Review Panel has made its recommendations to the legislature.  Please review.

No child Left Behind – Highly Qualified Teacher Requirements – NCLB Act of 2001 makes significant changes in educational programs including a strong focus on effective personnel and quality instruction.  This is not optional for charter schools.  It is a requirement that has to be met and in a timely manner.  Most importantly and especially schools receiving Title 1 Federal funds.  See attached memo from Betty Cox.

Charter School Leadership Insitute II:  Please print the flyer for your reminder of the Summer Institute that will be held in Orlando.  Last years Institute had great reviews and this year it will be even better.  Save the date, July 24 and 25.

National Charter Schools week is April 28th - May 2nd.  Mark your calendars and plan to do something special that week.

Best Regards,

R

Dear Friends,
                           These are the bills that have been filed regarding Charter Schools.  Some of these bills are "Shell Bills", meaning they are empty and will be filled in later.  Senate Bills:  152, 704,716 and House Bills:  15, 35, 231.  We will be tracking them for you, but you can also track them yourselves.
 
My own personal view point is the same as it has been over the last several years.  I create my budget without capital outlay in it and without any increases in FTE.  It is a bare bones budget.  Since we do not have a recurring funding source for capital outlay, we should be prudent in our planning.  If we get capital outlay, then I have plan B which is with full staffing, etc.  We don't know what will happen, but we do know that in the current Governor's Budget there is only $15 million.  Stay tuned, this is going to be a rough session.

Dear Governor Bush:  I have a question that was raised in the newspaper by our superintendant in regards to the class size amendment.    He said that the school district would have to hire 17 new  elementary school teachers unless the count could be distributed among ESE teachers, who only have several students or a much smaller class than a mainstream teacher has.  He said that if that were possible the district would only then have to hire 2 new elementary school teachers.  The chairman of our school board said she doubted there would be a loophole that big to allow that to happen.  Please tell me it isn't so, or I will be homeschooling my ESE child, who has wonderful teachers in ESE, who are already overworked.  Thank you for answering this question....

Dear Jeb, this morning our Rotary Club program was a presentation by the community affairs person for the SWFWMD.  She did a reasonably good job with her presentation, however, at each person's place there was a SWFWMD rain gauge and a drink insulator.  Let me see, they tax me, then give me a gift that I have no use for and that ends up costing me many times over what it would cost me, if I wanted it and went to the store and bought it.  As you can tell, I was flabbergasted that things have gotten this far out of hand.  Government spending at all levels is so obviously out of control at all levels, this was adding insult to injury.  
 
I am not sure that you are the person that should be receiving this communication, but feel free to forward it to any and all that you feel is appropriate.  I witness daily, the total disrespect for tax dollars that are collected from us, by their terribly unwwise use.  There are many sincere and responsible public employees, but there is also far too many that have no respect for where their departments source of income has come and how it should be responsibly use.  It starts with an additude of service and graditude, which is too little evident in public employees.  They should have more respect for their own tax contributions.
 
I heard a quote that real character is doing the right thing while no one is looking and no one but you (or I) know.  It would be nice to know that those that are supposed to be serving us have great character in how they use the resources we give to them to do just that.
 
Thanks for reading this.

DEar Goveror Bush,

Thank you fro your reply.  I should have been more specific. I apologize.

The lady who comes to give my son therapeutic massage has a 12 year old 
profoundly retarded son. She is a single mother.  Medicaid Waiver has been 
providing her 20 hours per week of Personal Care Assistance.

She just received a certified letter from Maximus in which they took away all 
of her PCA.  She cannot work and take care of her son without this help.  
What should she do?  As a consequence, other families are concerned that the 
same thing is going to happen to them.

It is a very frustrating life to have to deal with the challenges of a 
special needs child and then have to fight for needed services.  She has 
filed and appeal, but if she loses her appeal, she will have to repay the 
money to the state.

I don't know if you are aware of what we go through.  I have good services 
for my son, however many of us are very nervous, because of  Maximus, Mercer 
and Delmarva.
Delmarva is auditing everyone and has everyone scared.  What is this all 
about?

Thank you for listening,

Governor Bush,
 
Leadership Florida is conducting its 3rd annual Executive Leadership Program in Tallahassee April 9-11. The first year the program met you addressed the group at one of their lunches, and last year you graciously hosted the group at the mansion for lunch and conversation. (Leadership Florida, of course, paid all expenses for the function.) Needless to say, your participation was the highlight of the program for these individuals. The class will again be a high caliber group of chief executives and top leaders from companies and organizations in Florida. In order to be admitted to the program they must be new to the state or new to a top level position in their company. The goal of the program is to introduce them to the key leaders and issues in Florida, so that they might become involved and participate in leadership roles at the state level. I have attached the list of confirmed participants to date, and am told that they have approximately a half dozen others who are likely to commit. Though the list hasn't been released yet, I thought you might like to see it. 
 
Would you be willing to spend some time with the group again this year? We are willing to accommodate your schedule in whatever way you desire.The program will begin with a reception and dinner Wednesday evening the 9th, with sessions that include lunch and dinner on Thursday and a session ending with lunch on Friday the 11th. Any time you are available, we'd love to have you.
 
Thanks for your consideration,

Dear Governor Bush,

Our most sincere thanks for including the Autoimmune Center at the
University of Florida in your budget for 2003.  We greatly appreciate
your recognizing the significant difference a coordinated care center
can provide in cost savings and enhanced quality of care for the State
and patients.

We are proud to report the Center is prospering and meeting its goals
and objectives!  Significant Center findings confirm that half (51%) of
the patients referred to the Center are referred with an incorrect
diagnosis.  As you know, misdiagnosis results in treatment delays and
inappropriate drugs and therapies that are both costly and harmful to
the patient.

The Center is working hard to provide education on a Statewide level.
We have now educated 1,310 professionals and 1,200 patients at State and
Regional conferences.  In September 2003, we will host a Sjogren's/Lupus
conference for professionals and patients.  In addition, an application
to the NIDCR for an International Sjogren's Registry was recently
submitted.  (One of 3 in the Nation!)  Development of markers for
earlier diagnosis and treatment monitoring are also going strong!

Thank you Governor for continuing to care for the underserved.  Your
efforts have enabled the University of Florida to provide efficient and
cost effective diagnosis and treatment to patients using a
multidisciplinary team approach.

Your understanding of this grave need enhances the quality of life for
Citizens of Florida.

Keep the faith,
Betsy

    I have done some thinking about the proposed " bullet train" to run 
across Florida and I think it is the biggest case of nonsense that's come 
along for a long time. It is utterly ridiculous to even consider the thing. 
First of all , it will not improve the traffic congestion because the 
planners are conveniently overlooking the fact that there will have to be 
storage and parking facilities at eachend and at any place it stops to take 
on passengers. This will be chaos at these locations. We do not need the 
train. This is a dream that someone concocted to fulfill their ambition at 
the taxpayers expense. I have supported you in both elections and I consider 
you a very intelligent man and I'm proud to say I think you are a very good 
Governor. I hope you will put a stop to the "bullet Train" foolishness as I 
know you have the authority to do so and save the taxpayers a bundle of money 
to be used on worthy projects such as schools. Thank you for reading this.

Hi Beatrice,

Thank you for writing the Governor to share your ideas for cost savings to
the Medicaid program as well as environmental conservation. Prior to
publication of the new handbook, we carefully considered a number of
options to ensure access to the new DS Waiver Coverage and Limitation
provider handbook. In general, whenever a new provider enrolls in Medicaid,
they receive a copy of the appropriate provider handbook. If a provider
requests additional copies, the Medicaid billing agent charges $10.00 per
copy.  All Medicaid handbooks, including the DS waiver handbook are
available on the Medicaid fiscal agent website.

Since the DS Waiver Medicaid provider handbook is brand new and not all
providers have computer access, Medicaid provided a free, one time only
copy of the handbook which can be updated and revised through replacement
pages as needed. In addition, based on public input and our desire to
maximize feedback from families and consumers, we provided 2-3 copies of
all the final draft handbooks and the completed handbooks to each of the
Family Care Councils.  It may please you to know, there are a number of
training materials, including the new DS waiver provider direct provider
billing training manual available on the website and on CD rom. We are
certainly open to the idea of using CD roms for handbook information in the
future and  appreciate suggests to conserve costs (and trees!)

Your  continued advocacy  and tireless efforts to provide families with
information and education on many important health care issues as well as
the Medwaiver program are greatly appreciated. Please let me know if I can
be of any further assistance.

Sincerely,
Shelly Brantley, Director of
Developmental Disabilities Program

      Dear Jeb,

      I have been dealing now with the State for a couple of years, since I
      am a Medwaiver provider.
      It does amazing me the number of paper I am getting, unbeliveable.
      I am wondering how we still have trees in America.
      For exemple, the DD handbook is over 150 pages and is distribute to
      thousand of people.
      In the last two years, since it is changing all the time, had
      received 3 copy of them.
      It might seems like little expenses for the State but when you think
      about it, it is a huge expense.
      My point is that we should have handbooks for exemple on CDs. Easier
      to handle and way less
      costly. This was my point of view.

      Sincerely,

      Beatrice

Subject: Amy Barzach at Boundless Playgrounds writing to say thank you!


February 19, 2003
 
Dear Jeb,
 
It was wonderful to meet you and your team last Thursday and realize that we really can change the world – one playground at a time – when we are working with big picture thinkers like you who know how to make things happen.  I have always prided myself and everyone at Boundless Playgrounds on knowing how to create fully integrated, universally accessible playgrounds – and we have made a difference in children’s lives in the communities we have worked with but there are still too many children and people with disabilities sitting on the sidelines.
 
As Boundless Playgrounds enters its fifth year as a nonprofit organization, we have so much to celebrate and be thankful for.  I really do feel blessed and I am proud to tell you that over the last five years, we have helped people in 54 communities in 18 states throughout the country create playgrounds for their children of all abilities -- and as I write this email, we are helping 70 more.  Each completed playground serves hundreds and often thousands of children and people of all ages and all abilities – with physical, sensory and developmental disabilities and without any disabilities at all!
 
When I go to playgrounds Boundless Playgrounds has helped to give birth to and see children with and without disabilities laughing, playing, learning and growing together, I think about my son Jonathan and how he might have been one of those children – if he’d had a chance to grow up.  Jonathan would have been 9 years old this April 1st.  Many of the children with disabilities I see are playing in a playground for the very first time!  It gives me great joy to realize that because of the way Jonathan taught us to deal by celebrating life, children with disabilities are now able to play alongside their friends, families and classmates. And this is equally true for parents and grandparents with disabilities who can participate with the children they love. 
 
At the same time, my heart is broken over and over again when we get calls for help from moms and dads who desperately wish their child with a disability had some place to play.  The requests come not just from parents, but also from teachers, school nurses and community volunteers – as many as 200 every month (116 overall so far from people in Florida).  What these caring people need is encouragement, technical assistance and design/project management mentoring to begin an integrated playground project for the children of all abilities in their community.  And this is exactly what my team of talented and caring playground coaches, community builders and play environment designers are doing for the ones we are already helping – but there are not enough resources to help all of the people who are asking for help.  It’s sad to say but these ‘real people’ who care about the children of all abilities in their community are fighting prejudice - and the battle is even more daunting than anyone who isn’t prejudiced themselves could possibly imagine.  When I hear the pain and sadness in these determined peoples voices, it renews my commitment to help Boundless Playgrounds grow so we can help more of them.  
 
I can’t tell you how excited I was after our meeting on Thursday.  When I talked to you and to Liza (who is extraordinary) I realized that I don’t even know what I don’t know about public/private partnerships – and I am eager to meet with Liza and the others this Friday to start exploring how we make the Florida Boundless Playgrounds Initiative the best and most significant ever.  With your generous support we can help more people in Florida translate their passion into playgrounds where all of the childrenand people in their communities will be able to play together.  We so very much appreciate your enthusiasm and support for Boundless Playgrounds mission and my dream of playgrounds where everyone can play and learn together, regardless of ability or disability.  I can’t wait to get started.
 
 
Very truly yours,
 
Amy

Subject:	SIMPLE SOLUTION TO INSURANCE FRAUD

just read information about medicare figures and american attitudes toward insurance fraud (25% see no problem with defrauding insurance with false or exaggerated claims).
 
the fact is, when action and consequence are separated, or when a person can cheat without serious loss, THERE ARE ENOUGH IMMORAL AND DISHONEST PEOPLE TO DESTROY THE SYSTEM.
 
THE KEY IS TO MAKE SURE RISK AND PUNISHMENT FIT THE CRIME.
 
1.   As with welfare, limit lifetime benefits for medicare and medicaid.   This will make people think twice about spending that isnt' necessary.
 
2.    Require each person to pay out of own pocket and file for REIMBURSEMENT.     this will make them again think twice since its their money, not "the government's" that is at risk until expense is approved.
 
3.   charge anyone who RECEIVES MEDICARE OR MEDICAID FUNDS ON FRAUDULENT CLAIM UNDER RICO.     - WITH JAIL AND TREBLE DAMAGES.
 
4.  DO A "DEADBEAT MEDICARE/MEDICAID" LIST, like deadbeat dads.   Have a national database of people who committed medicare / medicaid fraud. 
 
5.  FINALLY, have a reward / bounty system.     Most people who commit insurance / medicare fraud like to brag about it.   Provide a finders fee system  (like the TIPS hotline).    the person found guilty would pay both reimbursement and fine, fine amount going to person reporting fraud.
 
BET WITH EVEN A FEW OF THESE IT WOULDN'T TAKE LONG BEFORE FRAUD WAS CUT AT LEAST 50%.

Hello Governor Bush, 
 
Thank you so much for your reply.  Mr.. Bowman told me he feels Dr. Williams' will be a good homeschool advocate as well, and I trust that you are both correct.  Here is what the Home Education Foundation, the principle home education lobbying group, sent out regarding Dr. Williams' appointment:
 
Dear Homeschooling friends,

We are asking for your help in an urgent matter! As you may know, Brenda Dickinson has worked long and hard hours with the Governor's Education Governance Reorganization Task Force, to ensure the best outcome for homeschoolers and private school students in Florida. Today we learned that the DOE is planning to announce the appointment (this week!) of an Overseer for the newly created Office of Non-Public and Home Education. Her name is Dr. Alex Penn-Williams, and we do not believe she is the right person for the job, as her time has been dedicated to public and charter schools, and it is unlikely that she will stand up for all the freedoms we've worked so hard to gain in homeschooling.

She has worked as a consultant for the Charter School Resource Center and the FL Board of Education. Her expertise is in testing and accountability. The Home Education Foundation is asking you to please contact the Governor to appeal for a change in that potential appointment. We want someone who is more sympathetic to the needs of homeschoolers, and who understands the benefits of homeschooling.

This is the first the majority of us ever heard of these efforts, and it didn't give us much of an opportunity to comment, coming as late into the issue as it did. The homeschool network, meaning, to my mind, the homeschool community at large, was not, in fact, consulted in any way, and rarely is.   I hope you will consider finding some way  to communicate BOE issues and concerns to home educators throughout the state in the future, as opposed to allowing only a small, not fully representative segment of homeschoolers input into the issues that concern all of us.

Thank you again for your time.

Sincerely,

Theresa Willingham

Dear Governor Bush,
 
J.C Bowman suggested I write to you and introduce myself.  He said you're very responsive to citizen input and inquiry, and so I thought I would take this opportunity to say hello and to voice some of my concerns regarding home education in Florida. 
 
I help lead the state home and alternative learning support and networking group, LIFE of Florida ( <http://www.LIFEofFlorida.org> www.LIFEofFlorida.org).  At LIFE of Florida, we value open forum communications and informed decision making.  Membership is free and all-inclusive.  Our group was created in direct response to what many of us have seen as entrenched special interests in Tallahassee by organizations like the Florida Parent Educators Association (FPEA), the Home Education Foundation (HEF) and the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA).  
 
All of these organizations purport to speak "for home educators in Florida," when, in fact, they speak for less than a third of homeschoolers, and rarely for those interested in a variety of school choice options like charter, magnet or cyber schools.  My concerns were raised once again this week, when a "call for action" from HEF and the FPEA went throughout the homeschool community regarding the upcoming appointment of Dr. Alex Penn Williams to the Office of Private Schools and Home Education.  From what I and others not "in the loop" with HEF and FPEA have been able to gather, this appointment was being discussed for some time in Tallahassee and the general homeschooling community was not apprised of the issue because, as one individual told me, "there are often things that should NOT be distributed to the general public until the proper time."  I find this offensive, a gross misuse of public trust and an improper circumvention of participatory democracy.
 
I would like to find someway to be able to involve more state home educators in their governance a little more fully and honestly than is currently the case.  I encourage involvement and self-education by our group members on issues which concern them, and often recommend the state's "paperless communications" resources.  I think the paperless communications are a wonderful idea and really value the information I receive through the system. However, nothing ever comes through regarding home education, and I think this particular venue is being underused.  If home educators could be apprised of relevant situations and legislation through this system, and possibly through online forums,  more would have a voice in the issues that affect them, and there would be less of an opportunity for special interests to become entrenched as they have. 
 
It would be wonderful to allow home educators and others more voice in their governance and I hope you believe that we are not only worthy of participating in our governance, but given that right by law.  I would appreciate your insights and thoughts on this issue.
 
Thank you so much for your time, Governor Bush.
 
Warmest Regards,
 
Theresa Willingham
Tampa, FL

Dear Governor Bush - Thank you for getting back to me. Wow!  I do not mind at all if you forward my e-mail to Jim Horne.  Regarding the dollar amount "promised".  I'm not sure I was promised anything. I was told when I took the job, and it's listed as a benefit in our benefits package, that critical need teachers are eligible for $5,000 for 2 years to help pay off student loans.  I need to look into this some more myself.  My husband and I are wondering if I am now eligible to apply for the award for more than 2 years because of the decreased amount of the award this year.  Anyway - any little bit helps and I should be grateful for $1750 and not complaining about not receiving the full award.  It was just a frustrating process and didn't turn out the way I had anticipated.  Additionally, one wants to feel that the work he or she does is appreciated and perhaps I took the lesser award too personally.  Thank you again for you time and attention. I do appreciate it.

Dear Governor Bush - I obtained your e-mail address from Kim Bays, a teacher I work with at Twin Lakes Academy in Jacksonville, and I know that she has corresponded with you in the past. I have assured her that I will not inundate you with complaints or criticism.  I know that you are most likely under fire right now for the class size ammendment, which many of  us in education realized from the get-go, was something sounded good on paper, but would be a nightmare to implement.  Ironically, I believe this was McBride's plan, yes?  Now I'm sure you are getting hit hard.  Anyway, that is not exactly what I'm writing about.  I hate to complain, but this will be a complaint, but also just an FYI. I don't know who else to share my woes with. Perhaps you have an answer; perhaps not. Either way, at least it can't be said that I didn't try all avenues.
 
Okay - I am a speech-language pathologist.  I have a B.A. in history/government from the University of Virginia. I have some post-graduate work in communication disorders and an M.S. in communication disorders from the University of Kentucky. I have worked in skilled nursing facilities and at a rehabilitation hospital with stroke patients and brain injuries prior to working in the public school system. I left the medical setting for the school system, mainly because I have a family and was having difficulty finding child care during school vacations when my daughter was out of school. I took about a $13-14,000 pay cut to come to the school system.  However, one of the draws of the public school system was the benefit of receiving $5,000 for two years (so maximum $10,000) that I could apply toward student loans, because speech pathology is a critical shortage need area.  I applied last July, sending in all my paperwork.  At that time I was told I would hear something in October.  When I didn't I phoned Tallahassee, and was told to call in November.  That didn't seem to be the month either and at the end of January, got in touch with State Representative Doug Wiles' office to see if they might help me.
 
Just this week, I received word that I did, indeed, qualify for an award.  The award amount is $1750. Obviously, this is no where near the anticipated $5,000.  I believe this is the maximum that the state can give, perhaps due to budgeting.  Still, I am crest-fallen.  Mr. Bush, it is not so much about the money.  It's about the fact that I am carrying a 100+ caseload and doing a pretty good job considering that size.  The school system is lucky to have me, and others like me.  I could easily leave for higher paying jobs that I'm contacted about daily, but I don't.  It is discouraging to me to see that the state of Florida will be pushing people through the teacher accredidation program, who may not even be qualified teachers, to accomodate this classroom size ammendment, yet it can't take care of other those of us with higher degrees who have already committed to the public education system.  I am working hard for this county and state, but don't feel like it's appreciated.
 
Mr. Bush, thank you so much for taking the time to read my windy letter.  As I stated earlier, I don't feel that you can do anything about my specific case, but I felt you might be interested in the goings-on of one public school employee.  I have resolved to write you another e-mail in the future that is purely positive in nature. Thank you again for your time. 
 
 
                                                                                            Sincerely,

Subject: Former Capitol Police Employee Response


	Governor,

	In response to your request for further information on this person,
I have developed the following research from previous DMS/Capitol Police
files, which are archived within DMS:

	Ms. Goldwich was employed by DMS as a Law Enforcement Officer with
the Capitol Police from April 22, 1994 to September 10, 1999.  At that time,
she resigned her position and accepted a non-sworn position with DMS.
During her five year employment with Capitol Police she:  

	Received Five Written Reprimands:
*	 03/07/96: Insubordination
*	 04/16/97: Willful violation of written rules, policies and/or
statutes.
*	 04/25/97: Unintentional destruction or misuse of state property
resulting in minor consequences.
*	 07/08/98: Unauthorized access to the personal office of an Attorney
General employee. 
*	 06/02/99: Absence without authorized leave.

	Filed Five Written Grievances and/or Complaints:
*	04/16/96
*	07/25/97
*	05/09/97
*	03/11/98
*	08/24/99

	Received Nine Statements of Counseling, Memorandums of Performance
or Verbal Counseling:
*	05/20/98
*	07/07/98
*	11/10/98
*	12/11/98
*	12/28/98
*	01/22/99 (2) 
	      One was the result of an internal investigation that was
Sustained for Causing Dissension Among Fellow Employees
*	06/01/99
*	06/24/99

	Her Last Yearly Evaluation dated March 1999 in part read:
	"During this rating period, Officer Goldwich has demonstrated that
she does not always support the goals and objectives of the organization in
that she has difficulty following direction, is argumentative with her
superiors and sometimes uses poor judgment in carrying out her duties."

	After leaving the agency, she filed an EEOC complaint and subsequent
Federal law suit alleging harassment and discrimination.  Documents
detailing the final disposition of the suit could not be located within the
present day Capitol Police files.  However, the Capitol Police Operations
Major recalls being advised that the allegations of harassment and
discrimination were not found to be justified.  

	In summary, my review found documents that reflected a history of
policy violations, problems with supervisors, an inability to accept
constructive criticism and supervisors who questioned her ability to make
sound decisions.  In reviewing her email to  you,  Ms. Goldwich acknowledges
upon leaving the Capitol Police in 1999, she needed time and space from her
law enforcement career for a variety of reasons including family and
volunteer activities - however none mentioned were related to her former
employment with the Capitol Police.  Her decision to delay for over two
years appears to have lead in part to her current predicament.  One
possibility she may want to consider is becoming a reserve officer with one
of the local agencies where she can maintain her law enforcement
certification.

	If you need further, I will be available any time.

	Scotty

GAO: MEDICAID, SCHIP NOT DOING ENOUGH TO MONITOR CHILDREN'S

ACCESS

Better methods should be developed to measure low-income

children's access to government health programs, according

to a report by the General Accounting Office. Compared to

Medicaid managed care, there appears to be less monitoring

of access to services for children enrolled in Medicaid

fee-for-service programs, which served the majority of

children in the 16 state programs reviewed in the GAO

report. GAO's report, "Medicaid and SCHIP: States Use

Varying Approaches to Monitor Children's Access to Care",

was issued Feb. 14.

Great report! I plan to present the information from GAO to President King and Speaker Byrd after our bills are filed by Sen Carlton and Rep. Bean. Clearly our Statewide Advocacy Council access issues 
would have placed Florida at the top of the GAO list for actually doing a great job but further recalcitrant access denial by Dr. Regeir's general counsel in the face of Section 402.164, et. seq., has made the State of Florida look rather stupid!  I have cc'd the Governor and hope he reads this as he has read our other e-mails from Statewide Advocacy Council leadership and finally he can bang some heads in Tallahassee together and tell everyone to quit acting like "human shields" to our investigatory and monitoring authority and give us the information that the Legislature and the Governor clearly wanted us to have access over the programs and services! We really should not need to having to introduce further legislation so that Florida state government lawyers can wake up and realize that we had unbridled access since June 2000.

Subject:	STOP  The Bad Changes For Homeschoolers

Dear Gov.  Bush & Chief of Staff Shanahan,

I am sorely concerned about the appointment of Dr. Penn Williams as Executive 
Director of the subject office.

This office was originally established to assure the autonomy, independence 
and non-governmental status.  We have, without government supervision, served 
the interests of the students of the homeschool community with accountability 
(already in place for many, many years) to the local Board of Education or, 
when applicable, Charter Schools.

The current system has worked very, very well.  The evidence of a working 
system is the fact that homeschool students consistently outperform public 
school students when tested.  They are high achievers, well rounded thinkers 
and learners who are contributing much to our world.  (As you'll recall a 
perfect SAT score was achieved by a homeschooled young man.)

Although Dr. Williams may be a fine individual and an asset to the public 
education system, she is in NOT qualified to understand and advocate 
independent education.  Dr. Williams is a public school person and her 
background will most assuredly influence the way she approaches her job as 
well as the new policies that might be developed under her leadership in the 
Office of Nonpublic and Home Education.

Furthermore, I also understand that the intent is to return this year to the 
FL Legislature Florida Statute 1001.21 to attempt to abolish the office and 
create a new office named the Office of Independent Education.  This office 
would oversee charter schools, private schools and home education.  It is my 
understanding that according to FS 1002.23, which is already in place, that 
charter schools are NOT independent schools!  Governor Bush and Ms. Shanahan, 
we urge you to stop this action and allow the law passed in 2002, FS 1001.21, 
to continue to "serve the interests of students and the parents of students 
in private schools and home education programs."

We are graciously asking that you protect our rights and provide us with an 
executive director in the subject office who has a legitimate knowledge of, 
and interest in, our rights to educate.  Dr. Penn Williams' background and 
experience does not reflect the goals, objectives or original intent of 
FS1001.21.  Her appointment to this position has grave consequences for those 
who have dedicated their lives to training and educating their children 
outside of the public educational arena.

I strongly appeal to you to change the direction that has been initiated and 
replace Dr. Penn Williams immediately!  Please replace her with someone who's 
background is commensurate with the leadership needs of the Office of 
Nonpublic & Home Education with the sole objective of serving the interests 
of students and the parents of students in private schools and home education 
programs. This objective was mandated in 2002 when FS 1001.21 was passed to 
assure our autonomy, independence and non-governmental status, PLEASE, please 
let's keep it that way!

Governor:
 
Sorry to send e-mails to you but I really think that your appointed advocates for Florida's most vulnerable citizens are getting the "Royal Treatment" from DCF and as a loyal supporter of yours and asked by Carole Jean Jordan to represent you in Indian River County during the past election, it appears to me that DCF employees have a lot of time on their hands that they can handle the duties of your appointment office!!  What Miss Betty and I discussed with you last year appears to have just vanished as if you never spent the time last July 9 to talk to Miss Betty and I about the Statewide Advocacy Council/Local Advocacy Council system. Please make sure that Al Levine, who, by the way, I think is a great guy and it was a great move by you to appoint to your staff, to fix these problems once and for all. I here a lot of your appointees, which we make up about 1/3 of all the citizens you appoint are about to quit as volunteers because of the attitude by government employees that we do not have access to records when 402.164, et. seq. expressly states that we do. Thanks.
 
Craig.

Lee,
I have never heard of such a thing!  I have no idea what Lou Kirk is talking about, and I doubt that he does either.  DCF has nothing to do with background screening of LAC members, and if this starts they are really asking for trouble.  They have enough to do with keeping up with screening their providers.....some of whom I bet are behind in screening!

Do you want to inform Lou that this is not DCF's job, or should I inform Mike Murphy that Lou is getting into territories that are not his domain?  However, now that Lou has opened this door, please find out about which "FLAC" member his concern is in reference.  If Lou is concerned that the member has not been screened in five years, this must be a second term member who has recently been appointed.  It would also be interesting to know why this came up in a NAMI monitoring.  Now that the question has arisen, let's get answers from Lou.
For Lou's information, the LAC members are very well screened by the Governor's office and SAC.  In fact, they are probably more thoroughly screened than most state employees, including Lou himself!  

Lee, due to the problems about access that Harry Propper is presently attempting to resolve, I think you may want to let him know that another flag is being waved by Lou Kirk.

I understand that you will soon be appointing a School Board member to the East Central Florida Regional Planning Commission.

 

Brevard School Board Chairman Janice Kershaw is one of the candidates. I believe she would be an excellent choice for the appointment.

 

Cynthia and I have known Janice for the past six years and I have worked with her in meetings and activities between the BCC Board and the School Board. She is easy to work with and logical in her approach. 

 

She has been involved in Republican clubs and in a number of community activities including Leadership Brevard and Brevard Tomorrow that give her the experience needed for the East Central Florida Regional Planning Commission.  

 

Thanks for your consideration

 

Jim & Cynthia

Jeb,
Sorry to bother you but I needed to let you know that the sale of the land this center is located on is being sold to the Manatee County School District and the sale was approved by the cabinet. It is a good deal for all concerned. The district gets the land for a new high school they need badly and the monies from the sale will be used to build a replacement Education Center in southern Hillsborough County. One school board member has taken it upon himself to try and block the deal even though all of the staff and other members like the deal. Mike Bennett supports the sale as well as all of the ag community. The school board member told me that he had contacted you to try to get you to intercede in the matter. My recommendation to you is let the locals handle it. It's not often that we get the opportunity to build a new research facilty without asking for any new monies.  Things are good at Florida Housing but we will miss Mark Kaplan.  

                            Thanks,

                                     Jay Taylor

Governor,
 
Perhaps you could create a tax credit to encourage corporate America in Florida to help solve this dilemma...  Just an idea.

Long line for help: Backlog of disabled grows to 10,500
BY CAROL MARBIN MILLER
cmarbin@herald.com


 	
	
	
PARENTAL SUPPORT: Laura and Steve Muzzillo play with 5-year-old Molly in their Cooper City home. With Medicaid coverage, the Muzzillos qualified for nine hours of speech therapy each week for Molly. Now they can afford no more than one hour, and therapists say Molly's progress already has diminished. CANDACE WEST/HERALD STAFF	

Amy Harrington is sitting on a carpeted floor facing a mirror, cradling 5-year-old Molly Muzzillo in her lap. Molly's long auburn hair sways as Harrington rocks her from side to side.

''Rock, rock, rock the boat, gently down the stream,'' Harrington sings, and Molly sits, transfixed, looking in the mirror. Harrington, a speech therapist, draws her curled fingertips together, then separates them, making the sign-language symbol for the word ``more.''

''Are you going to ask for more?'' Harrington asks, encouraging Molly to sign the word. She waits, and waits, but Molly does not ask for more.

Stricken at birth with a rare genetic disorder that has left her physically and mentally disabled, it's profoundly difficult for Molly to express herself, to say even a word as simple as ''more.'' Her parents, Laura and Steve Muzzillo of Cooper City, speak for her.

For two years, they have been asking for more. But they are among 10,500 Floridians on a waiting list for services for disabled people.

In four years, Gov. Jeb Bush has doubled funding for the state program, which is designed to allow even severely disabled people to avoid living in institutions. But the number of Floridians served by the program has tripled. Meanwhile, thousands more have asked for help and have been turned away.

This year, Bush is asking for between $80 million and $100 million in new spending. Advocates for the disabled say it will barely keep pace with new demand and other strains on the system, such as the needs of current clients.

INSURANCE DENIED

Because Molly Muzzillo's disorder is congenital, the Muzzillos repeatedly have been denied private insurance. In October, the state canceled the family's Medicaid coverage for Molly, saying Steve's salary of about $50,000 left him ineligible for that federal program, which covers only the most financially needy. The state's earlier decision to grant coverage was a mistake, the Muzzillos say they were told.

With the Medicaid coverage, the Muzzillos qualified for nine hours of speech, occupational and physical therapy each week. Now, they can afford no more than one hour of speech, and therapists say Molly's progress has already diminished.

Molly would almost certainly be eligible for the state program, which uses state and federal dollars to offer care and insurance to disabled people regardless of income. But for every three Floridians who are on the plan, another one is on the waiting list.

''I've done everything they've told me to do, and they just keep saying no.'' said Steve Muzzillo, who owns a Pembroke Pines medical supply store with his brother.

''I try so hard to get what she needs, and I'm failing as her father,'' Muzzillo said, tears welling in his eyes.

The problem isn't a new one. In 1996, when U.S. District Judge Wilkie Ferguson said the state was breaking the law by requiring Floridians to wait years for taxpayer-funded care, the state was ranked 47th in the nation in the amount it paid to help the disabled.

AT BOTTOM AGAIN

Bush's first budgets set aside $360 million in new dollars to allow the disabled to live in their own homes, or small group homes, while receiving the care they needed.

Within about two years, the state's waiting list, with between 9,000 and 10,000 names, was eliminated, and another 5,000 to 6,000 Floridians began to receive services under the Medicaid program. Now, 25,000 Floridians are receiving some type of help.

Florida moved up to 37th in a report published by University of Colorado professor David Braddock.

But as administrators with the Department of Children & Families struggled to eradicate the waiting list, a new one developed. And now it's longer than the one that Bush inherited, with about 10,500 names.

In Braddock's most recent report, which uses 2000 figures, Florida had slipped back down to 48th in the United States for the money it invests in care for the disabled.

Most people on the waiting list could begin to receive care immediately if they opted to live in either a public or private institution, mostly large facilities where profoundly disabled people live in campus-like settings. A bed in such an institution costs, on average, about $75,000 per year.

But for those on the waiting list, the state will not pay one-third of the cost to allow a disabled person to live in his or her own home. ''Here, I'm looking for $1,500 a month just to pay for her therapies,'' Steve Muzzillo said. ``And yet they will pay $70,000 to put her in an institution.''

Elizabeth Hirst, a spokeswoman for Bush, said his administration must be credited with doubling the dollars that pay for community care for the disabled.

''It has very much been his priority to improve the quality of life and the services provided to our citizens who have developmental disabilities,'' she said.

`WANTS TO DO MORE'

``Right now, what we're looking at are more disabled persons receiving services who never have before.

''The governor wants to do more,'' she said. ``This is one of the few areas in which he is calling for increased funding.''

Helene Good, who heads the Miami-Dade-based Community Committee for Developmental Handicaps, said state officials grossly miscalculated the number of disabled Floridians who needed help.

For decades before Ferguson's 1996 ruling, many disabled people were told not to bother putting their names on a waiting list. In some counties, it was not uncommon to wait 20 years before some help was offered.

''There was a whole generation of people who didn't get services,'' Good said. ``When money became available and people were able to begin receiving services, we had a whole generation of people who had been waiting, plus everyone else who had been born or moved to the state.

''No matter how much of an increase you put into the program, which has been considerable, there was no way it would be enough to address essentially 25 to 30 years of financial neglect,'' Good added.

URGENT PLIGHT

Maritza Ruiz believes the plight of her cousin could not be much more urgent.

Her 38-year-old cousin, who is on the waiting list, is profoundly disabled -- incapable of walking, eating or bathing without assistance. Her elderly mother has grown frail and infirm caring for Ruiz's cousin and now suffers from diabetes, high blood pressure and a ruptured disk.

Still, Ruiz's aunt waits. She cannot lift more than five pounds and has to have groceries delivered because she cannot leave her daughter alone.

''She really, truly needs help, and she has never abused the system before,'' Ruiz said. ''You have to be out on the street and homeless before you will get care,'' Ruiz said, ``which is outrageous.''

For some, even the prospect of losing a home is not enough. Denise Karp and her husband, Marc, also on the waiting list, took out a second mortgage and refinanced their Coral Springs home to pay for expensive therapies for their autistic 8-year-old son, Noah. With Marc Karp's cosmetic display business failing, the family has been unable to make payments on the mortgage in more than a year. In recent months, the Karps have seen their phone service cut off and threats to turn off the electricity.

NO REGRETS

Still, Denise Karp regrets nothing. Thanks in part to the therapies, language tutoring and behavioral programs, Noah can speak and read now. ''I could not stand by and let my child wither,'' she said.

Molly Muzzillo was 17 months old when the Muzzillos learned their perfect baby was not perfect. Molly could not speak, walk or do many of the other things that other toddlers could do. They took her to a specialist, who proclaimed, ``Do whatever you can for this child, because she will never be normal.''

Over time, grief gave way to determination, and the Muzzillos set about doing everything they could to make Molly as ''normal'' as possible.

Molly attends a preschool run by the Ann Storck Center, a Broward County agency that cares for disabled children and adults. She plays with her Bijon Frise dog, Spunky.

When her parents can afford it, they take her horseback riding, because experts say it may help prompt her to talk.

But Harrington, Molly's speech therapist, said the little girl already has shown disturbing signs of losing progress since the family cut back on her therapies.

Early-childhood development experts say small children suffer the most from a lack of services.

''If an adult has a stroke, you do not wait five years and then give them therapy,'' said Adele Luxa, an occupational therapist at St. Petersburg's All Children's Hospital, which serves children throughout Central Florida. ``That doesn't make any sense. The closest to the injury, whether it is a birth injury or congenital, the more impact you have.''

Florida Voters Overwhelmingly Support Reining in the Out-of-Control Medical Liability Lawsuit System

 

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - Today, the Florida Medical Association released the results of a statewide poll of registered voters that finds there is broad public support for the issue of capping non-economic damages in medical liability cases at $250,000. The poll, conducted by The Tarrance Group, during February 11 -13, 2003, found that 86% of the voting public supports a proposal being considered by the State Legislature to reform the medical malpractice lawsuit system in Florida by capping the amount of money that a patient could be rewarded for non-economic damages - sometimes called "pain and suffering" - to $250,000.  

 

"This poll reaffirms what many of us in the medical profession have been saying for over a year," stated Bob Cline, M.D., FMA President.  "There is a medical liability insurance crisis in this state and the public is demanding that the legislature deal with this important issue before health care is either unaffordable or, in some cases, unavailable in many parts of Florida."

 

Furthermore, the poll found that the vast majority of voters blame the trial attorneys for the current crisis with regard to the medical malpractice lawsuit system in Florida.  In fact, an overwhelming 90% would favor limiting the amount of money trial lawyers can keep from jury awards that are meant for patients. 

 

"We are pleased to see that the public understands this issue and is clearly concerned about the lawsuit lottery system in Florida that is driving up the cost of healthcare for everyone," stated Sandra B. Mortham, CEO/EVP of the FMA.  "The public is tired of a few trial lawyers getting rich off the system while many Floridians are unable to afford health insurance."

 

The survey found that voters trust their family doctors the most when it comes to providing them with accurate, unbiased information about the medical liability insurance crisis.  In addition, voters said they trusted trial lawyers the least when it comes to accurate, unbiased information about the medical liability insurance crisis in Florida.    

 

The poll found that 38% ranked affordability as their greatest concern with regard to health care, while 33% cited frivolous lawsuits driving doctors out of state as the greatest concern with health care in Florida.  Another 16% cited access to the doctor of their choice as the biggest concern.

 

The poll also found that a remarkable 80% of the voters said they have seen, read or heard about the medical liability insurance crisis in Florida and fully eight out of every ten voters are at least "very" concerned about the issue of medical malpractice lawsuits and the impact they have on the cost and availability of health care services in Florida.  It is important to note that all voters, regardless of age, gender, region, or partisanship, show very significant concern about medical malpractice lawsuits driving up the cost of healthcare in Florida.   

 

"There is no question that the public is aware of this crisis and thinks the legislature should act immediately," stated David J. Sackett, Partner in the The Tarrance Group.  "The support for a $250,000 cap on non-economic damages in medical liability cases is spread across every region of the State and is equally supported by all voters, regardless of their age, gender, or partisan affiliation."

Re:  Rick L. Jancha
       Candidate - Seventh Judicial District Circuit Court Judge

Dear Governor Bush:

Several exceptional attorneys have seeked out my support for their
appointment to the position of Judge, Seventh Judicial District Circuit
Court, many of whom are highly qualified and extremely poised for this
coveted position.  However, after giving this matter my utmost attention and
most prudent consideration, I came to the conclusion that the candidate that
is most worthy of my unconditional recommendation is Rick Jancha.  

Taking into account the most pressing issues of our time, issues that
destroy families, unravel communities and undermine the very foundation that
drives our free society, nothing has more of a detrimental influence than
that of uncontrolled drug trafficking and abuse.  Rick Jancha has reckoned
with these issues head on.  He made it his mission to break down drug crime
in central Florida, sometimes piece by piece, until remarkable results were
achieved.  His work with Senator Bob Graham and Congressman John Mica to
designate central Florida as a HDFTA and then working tirelessly on the
Executive Committee and the Intelligence Sub-Committee were significant in
identifying and mitigating the spread of drug trafficking in many arenas.

It takes the unrelenting commitment of a truly dedicated and courageous
citizen to take on the degree of crime that my revered friend Rick has
faced.  He has never deviated from his steady pursuit in resolve of his
convictions.  Rick Jancha's reputation as a moral pillar upholding the laws
of our land distinguishes him in countless ways from others.  By dismantling
drug crime, tackling sophisticated internet crime as well as undercover
computer crime operations, committing of himself and conveying his
impeccable standards to provide valuable education at both the FLETC levels
as well as international levels symbolizes the monumental character of this
man, a man destined to make a measurable difference through his chosen
cause.

Governor, I urge you to strongly consider this devoted, highly trained
professional who has maintained the highest degree of integrity throughout
his distinguished career.  I do not think you could place a more honorable
candidate than Rick L. Jancha to fulfill the high-level responsibilities of
Seventh Judicial District Circuit Court Judge.  I trust you will feel free
to contact me if I can provide any other information regarding this
important matter.

Sincerely,




Mori Hosseini

Betty,
I just spoke to Lou. NAMI was monitored recently and apparently Stan has
done volunteer work for NAMI and was last screened by DCF in 1995. There is
a requirement that re-screening take place every five years. Nancy Starr
prompted Lou to look into this. I explained to him that LAC members are
appointed by the Governor and that office performs back ground screening at
the time of the initial appointment and at reappointments. Lou told me he'd
speak with Nancy and get back with me....... Lou just called back and
stated Nancy will not be available until next Wednesday. I'm sure it's a
misunderstanding on the part of Nancy and/or Lou......it looks like they
are confusing the LAC and NAMI volunteer roles. ......I just spoke to Stan
about volunteering for NAMI. He and his wife mentor a mentally ill child
through a NAMI Program....he has been doing this for some time and was
screened by DCF previously.....he agrees Lou is confusing the two roles and
is aware he has to be screened as a NAMI volunteer. I'll follow up with
Lou/Nancy and keep you apprised.

Lee,
I really do not think I can totally consider it a dead issue until you find
out more from Lou.........such as:
1. Who told him he needed to find out about background screening of LAC
members?
2. Who is the LAC member in question?
3. Why did this come up in a NAMI monitoring?
4. Does he now understand that it is not his job to check or question
screening of LAC members?

When I have these answers, I may be able to consider it a dead issue.

	Florida Voters Overwhelmingly Support Reining in the Out-of-Control
	Medical Liability Lawsuit System
	
	
	
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - Today, the Florida Medical Association released the
	results of a statewide poll of registered voters that finds there is
	broad public support for the issue of capping non-economic damages in
	medical liability cases at $250,000. The poll, conducted by The Tarrance
	Group, during February 11 -13, 2003, found that 86% of the voting public
	supports a proposal being considered by the State Legislature to reform
	the medical malpractice lawsuit system in Florida by capping the amount
	of money that a patient could be rewarded for non-economic damages -
	sometimes called "pain and suffering" - to $250,000. 
	
	
	
	"This poll reaffirms what many of us in the medical profession have been
	saying for over a year," stated Bob Cline, M.D., FMA President.  "There
	is a medical liability insurance crisis in this state and the public is
	demanding that the legislature deal with this important issue before
	health care is either unaffordable or, in some cases, unavailable in
	many parts of Florida."
	
	
	
	Furthermore, the poll found that the vast majority of voters blame the
	trial attorneys for the current crisis with regard to the medical
	malpractice lawsuit system in Florida.  In fact, an overwhelming 90%
	would favor limiting the amount of money trial lawyers can keep from
	jury awards that are meant for patients.
	
	
	
	"We are pleased to see that the public understands this issue and is
	clearly concerned about the lawsuit lottery system in Florida that is
	driving up the cost of healthcare for everyone," stated Sandra B.
	Mortham, CEO/EVP of the FMA.  "The public is tired of a few trial
	lawyers getting rich off the system while many Floridians are unable to
	afford health insurance."
	
	
	
	The survey found that voters trust their family doctors the most when it
	comes to providing them with accurate, unbiased information about the
	medical liability insurance crisis.  In addition, voters said they
	trusted trial lawyers the least when it comes to accurate, unbiased
	information about the medical liability insurance crisis in Florida.   
	
	
	
	The poll found that 38% ranked affordability as their greatest concern
	with regard to health care, while 33% cited frivolous lawsuits driving
	doctors out of state as the greatest concern with health care in
	Florida.  Another 16% cited access to the doctor of their choice as the
	biggest concern.
	
	
	
	The poll also found that a remarkable 80% of the voters said they have
	seen, read or heard about the medical liability insurance crisis in
	Florida and fully eight out of every ten voters are at least "very"
	concerned about the issue of medical malpractice lawsuits and the impact
	they have on the cost and availability of health care services in
	Florida.  It is important to note that all voters, regardless of age,
	gender, region, or partisanship, show very significant concern about
	medical malpractice lawsuits driving up the cost of healthcare in
	Florida.  
	
	
	
	"There is no question that the public is aware of this crisis and thinks
	the legislature should act immediately," stated David J. Sackett,
	Partner in the The Tarrance Group.  "The support for a $250,000 cap on
	non-economic damages in medical liability cases is spread across every
	region of the State and is equally supported by all voters, regardless
	of their age, gender, or partisan affiliation."

I don't mean to quibble with you sir, but would you accept the term tax
reduction or tax break. I understand what you are saying about the
depreciation piggyback, but it is in fact a reduction or break on this
year's taxes meant to foster equipment purchases. I understand that it is an
acceleration on taxes and eventually goes away. But there is a tangible
benefit for two years for businesses if they use it.

You all also this past year lowered the tax rate trigger for unemployment
comp, although that only cost the state about $24 million.

The answer to your first questions is that we would be far worse off
without the tax cuts in the first few years. The money would have been
spent, plain and simple.

Last years budget was created through an ugly process, and there was too
much spending. There was not however any tax cuts. There was the
piggyback issue which is not a cut.

Dear Governor
this is Gary Fineout

If I am catching you at a bad time I apologize. I know you are returning
from Spain today and you must turn around and head to Washington.

But I am working on a story previewing the budget situation that
confronts Florida. One of the things that I find interesting is that
there appear to be parallels with what happened to the federal budget
during the Reagan era and what has happened the last few years in
Florida. (My story will include a quote from "The Triumph of Politics"
by David Stockman.)

My questions are these:

"Were you ever afraid that the tax cuts that you supported would come
back and cause problems if there were ever a recession? Or did you move
forward knowingly, realizing that if there was an economic downturn that
the lack of revenue sources would make it easier to propose smaller
government?


"Was it a good course of action to push tax cuts without also enacting
spending cuts?"

"Is what has happened, especially last year when the budget included tax
cuts, large spending increases and a heavy reliance on non-recurring
money, a reflection of the reality of dealing with a Legislature that
has different priorities than you?"

Thanks in advance for your assistance.
Gary Fineout

	Governor,
	
	Thank you again for your time today to discuss the various issues that I
	hope to be involved in this Session.  In particular, I appreciate your
	assistance with the Capco program. 
	
	I am confident that when you look into the history of the program and
	its success in leveraging the state’s investment, you will agree that
	the Capco funds were integral in creating a favorable capital climate
	for Florida’s entrepreneurs over the past four years.  As we discussed,
	Entomos, one of the two anchors of the University of Florida Center of
	Excellence, is a testament to the program’s success in leveraging the
	state’s investment to help grow some of the incredible technologies
	being developed at our research universities.
	
	As you are aware, the real success of early stage venture capital
	investments takes time and years to fully realize.  We have asked these
	venture capitalists to make some of the riskiest investments in our
	state on technologies and business ideas that have been unable to find
	any other type of financing.  These venture capitalists have met this
	challenge, invested the money ahead of the schedule that we set on them,
	and have some budding success stories to show for it.  I will concede
	that during this tough time for technology businesses that there have
	been some disappointments, but that is inherent in venture capital
	investment, particular early stage technology.
	
	I appreciate the present fiscal constraints facing our state budget, and
	while I think that I can persuade the interested venture capitalists to
	work with us in these tough fiscal times to possibly stage out the
	fiscal impact another year, you must agree that Florida needs an
	infusion of investment capital now more than ever. 
	
	I look forward to assisting you in any way as you look into this program
	in greater depth.  Thank you again for your assistance and your constant
	willingness to work with me on issues that are important to me and to
	the citizens of our state.

Subject:	How unions take advantage of teachers

One of the reasons the teacher unions so strongly advocate small class size is that it requires the hiring of more teachers.  This doesn't benefit individual teachers as they must split salary budgets with far greater numbers of teachers.  The net effect will be to limit teacher raises for the foreseeable future.  However, the number of new teacher union members will increase.  
 
Below is an article from National Review Online about exploitation of teachers by their unions.
 
Marie
 
 
Widespread Exploitation:  Widespread Exploitation:  How the teachers’ unions take advantage of
their own members.
http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-greene-forster021003.asp

By Jay P. Greene and Greg Forster
National Review Online

When it was recently revealed that the Washington, D.C., teachers' union
had been stealing money from its own members, some may have seen it as
just an isolated incident. But financial exploitation of teachers by
their own unions is built into the very structure of U.S. education.

Not content with exploiting children by keeping them locked in failing
schools, the unions also exploit their own members, most of whom are
dedicated and hardworking professionals.

While it isn't as flagrant as stealing union dues — in fact, it isn't
even illegal — this form of exploitation involves far larger sums of
money and far greater ramifications for society at large.

To see how the unions take advantage of their membership, we need to
look at a major structural change in education over the past 30 years.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, average spending per
public-school student in 2000-01 was $8,830, almost double the $4,626
spent in 1970-71, adjusting for inflation.

Given that national 12th-grade standardized-test scores have been flat
over this period and the high-school dropout rate has gone up, it's fair
to ask just what the U.S. public has been getting in return for all this
extra spending.

The single greatest factor driving the doubling of education spending in
the last 30 years has been the hiring of a huge new army of teachers.
Turning again to the U.S. Department of Education, we find that the
number of students for every teacher in public school has shrunk from
22.3 in 1971 to 15.1 in 2001.

This means that there has been a 48-percent increase in the
public-school teaching workforce relative to the student population.

Since teachers' salaries represent the bulk of education spending, a
48-percent increase in the teacher workforce probably accounts for close
to half of the doubling in education spending. This is especially likely
since teachers' salaries have grown a little faster than inflation, from
$40,850 in 1970-71 to $42,898 in 2000-01 dollars.

Furthermore, the salary number excludes benefits, especially health
benefits that have been increasing in value much faster during the same
time period, so total education labor costs have probably increased
somewhat faster than these numbers indicate.

But here's the catch: Spending all that extra money to hire all those
teachers hasn't had much effect on class sizes. According to survey data
collected by the National Education Association, the average number of
students in public-school classrooms was 27 in 1971.

By 1996 the average class size dropped to 24 students in elementary
school, but rose to 31 students in secondary school. While parents
constantly clamor for smaller classes, the 48-percent growth in the
teacher workforce hasn't made much of a dent in class sizes.

Why not? One major reason is that, while there are a lot more teachers
per student than there used to be, each individual teacher is doing a
lot less work. The same NEA survey shows that the average number of
students taught per day by each secondary public school teacher dropped
from 134 in 1971 to 97 in 1996.

That's a 28-percent decrease in each teacher's classroom burden. As the
number of students per teacher has dropped dramatically, teachers have
taught fewer classes per day, rather than teaching smaller classes, as
parents would prefer.

So the near-doubling in education spending per student has not largely
been consumed by enriching individual teachers, whose salaries have
grown only a little faster than inflation, nor by offering students the
smaller classes that families have been demanding.

Instead, as teachers' salaries continue to lose ground to salaries in
other professions and students continue to sit in large classes, the
bulk of the spending increase appears to have been consumed by hiring a
whole lot more teachers at only modestly higher salaries, while
requiring each of them to teach fewer students per day.

Whose interests does this serve? Perhaps some teachers prefer to work
less and get very modest raises rather than work the same amount and get
bigger raises. But it doesn't seem likely that most teachers feel that
way, since we constantly hear teachers complain about the growing salary
gap between teaching and other professions.

Anyone who is well-educated enough to become a teacher is also
well-educated enough to enter many other careers that pay better. A new
college graduate makes a significant financial sacrifice if he decides
to embark upon a teaching career.

The teachers' unions, by contrast, make out like bandits from this
arrangement. First, they gain financially. If they wanted to rake in
more money by raising union dues, they would face stiff opposition from
their members.

On the other hand, by jacking up their total number of members, they can
take the same small amount of money out of a larger number of paychecks.
Just imagine what the 48-percent growth in the teacher workforce has
done for union budgets.

Second, they gain politically. The unions owe their enormous influence
on education policy, including their death lock on education policy in
the Democratic party, as much to their army of political volunteers as
they do to their bulging bank accounts.

Every election year, the unions send out the shock troops to canvass,
stuff envelopes, hand out literature at polling places, and do all the
rest of the thankless drudgery that politics requires.

A 48-percent increase in the teacher workforce means a 48-percent larger
pool from which those shock troops can be drawn. And even the teachers
who don't become volunteers will at least become voters whose livelihood
depends on the public school system.

So the next time you hear the teachers' unions complain that teachers'
salaries are abysmally low and class sizes are atrociously high, bear in
mind that those facts don't exist in a vacuum.

Teachers' salaries have stagnated and class sizes haven't significantly
shrunk in large part because of policies that convey ever more money and
power to the teachers' unions.

When it was recently revealed that the Washington, D.C., teachers' union
had been stealing money from its own members, some may have seen it as
just an isolated incident. But financial exploitation of teachers by
their own unions is built into the very structure of U.S. education.

Not content with exploiting children by keeping them locked in failing
schools, the unions also exploit their own members, most of whom are
dedicated and hardworking professionals.

While it isn't as flagrant as stealing union dues — in fact, it isn't
even illegal — this form of exploitation involves far larger sums of
money and far greater ramifications for society at large.

To see how the unions take advantage of their membership, we need to
look at a major structural change in education over the past 30 years.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, average spending per
public-school student in 2000-01 was $8,830, almost double the $4,626
spent in 1970-71, adjusting for inflation.

Given that national 12th-grade standardized-test scores have been flat
over this period and the high-school dropout rate has gone up, it's fair
to ask just what the U.S. public has been getting in return for all this
extra spending.

The single greatest factor driving the doubling of education spending in
the last 30 years has been the hiring of a huge new army of teachers.
Turning again to the U.S. Department of Education, we find that the
number of students for every teacher in public school has shrunk from
22.3 in 1971 to 15.1 in 2001.

This means that there has been a 48-percent increase in the
public-school teaching workforce relative to the student population.

Subject:	Kevin C. Smith #J07148/Florida State Prison Thank you and update

Dear Jeb:
I appreciate all your help but things are getting worse since I've started exposing the truth at FSP. I was able to scan a letter sent to me from an anominous person at the prison warning me about exposing the truth. I marked out their name and what they do to protect them from the good ole boys there and this person is going to help me expose the truth. I also received a letter from Kevin today that I was not able to scan clear enough to send the original but will tell you what it said. I'm still learning how to use the scanner I got for Christmas. It said at 4:35 a.m. he was attending a callout to the clinic for them to test his blood. Well, C/O Hall was up there. He asked Kevin his name and when he told him he said "Oh your the piece of shit" Kevin said What did you say sir? He said "rather  your mother is " Then he went on to threaten Kevin by saying  "You got your mom calling up here about that bullshit" Well, I'm going to teach you  you just wait before I am done you'll have about 2 or 3 DR's tell your mommy that. So Kevin said he ignored him and filed grievances to his Lt. and the Colonel. Then a couple of hours later they took him to see the inspector. This inspector is incompetent, bias and has a really bad attitude. He weighted Kevin then called him a liar and me a liar. He hardly let Kevin talk and when he tried to defend his complaints he told him he had a smart mouth. He also said he was going on the Internet and tell everyone that I was a liar and none of my accusations are true. This guy is crooked they are true. Don't send him back again and he needs to be fired for what he did and said. Kevin says he won't listen to the truth but when you read the letter I received you will see we are telling the truth and even some of the inspectors are crooked. After he saw Kevin they sat him in a holding cell for over two hours. Kevin's said he kept telling him he needed to go to the bathroom bad and they kept ignoring him. He finally couldn't hold it any longer and wet the floor. Which then pissed the Sgt. off, he really tried to hold it and told them and told them but those jerks ignored him it was an accident. Now when is this going to stop because I am not giving up till the truth is exposed even though now my safety is jeopardized as well. I've already told everyone in prison reform not to stop the fight to expose the truth if something happens to me. Please get to the truth before its too late. Enclosed is the letter I received warning me about Kevin and my safety. Thanks Jeb I know you will help once again and don't give this to Judy Belcher she'll just give it back to the good ole boys instead of getting to the truth and jeopardize Kevin and my life more. Janice Smith

Janice Smith I know your son here at FSP I am an ~ and cannot give my name please for your own
safety and the safety of your son be careful. And please realize that there is a lot of good c.o.s here that come
to work and actually do there jobs and aren't in the mix of corruption that goes on. I can give you more
information than any chaplain or classification officer I work the wings on a daily basis and I know the truth
yes your son is a pain in the rear but so are the other 900 or so inmates here but as far as dis respect and the
other bullshit no he is not the one and there is definitely some thing to be said about the food. and further
more you should start looking really hard at the wing seargeant Reynolds, Shawn and his felony convictions
and then raise the question as to why he is the one responsible for watching over your son. Keep up the
vigilant work and maybe one day the walls will become transparent. May GOD richly bless you and yours.

Dear Gov. Bush,

Im a Floridian studying in Philadelphia, and am about to graduate and enter the 
proverbial "real world."  After taking countless classes in political science, 
public policy, and having gained a better understanding for how our government 
works, I still wonder what it is that I could do, or what it is that 
executives, legislators, and local electeds can do to change, create, and alter 
public policies--because I want to learn from you in the job that I may one day 
want for myself.  

I see changes every day--but most of them seem like the same old solutions to 
the same old wounds. On the federal level, I have seen the effects of public 
policy like the EITC for lower income families.  On the state level, I have 
seen the effects of the 10% plan in our state. 

And so I wonder what you would do--to remedy a problem, any problem, that we 
have in our state, or even in our country--or might have in the future.  

I wonder what we could do for our state if there were boundless limits (i.e. 
$$$)...
Any recommendations for a public management problem or a public policy....

Con mucho cariNo,
Off the record,

He is well-respected by both the lawyers and the judges.  Before joining the federal bench, he served three years on the state bench, having been appointed by Governor Bob Martinez.  Before joining the judiciary he served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of Florida, and as a commercial litigator in Tampa.  He has been involved in government and politics for most of his career, and in the 1980s served on the Hillsborough County Republican Executive Committee and as a member of the Tampa Bay Young Republican Club.  His subsequent appointments with the Department of Justice and federal judiciary required that he forego political activity.
 
Barry is well qualified to be a federal judge.  The best compliment I can pay Barry is that lawyers have the option of stipulating to trying a federal case before a Magistrate rather than the federal judge designated in the case, if all counsel so agree.  On many occasions the lawyers on both sides have stipulated to have Barry try the case - truly a high compliment because lawyers usually cannot agree on anything.
 
I just happened to be talking about Barry's name having been submitted to TomTew (whom I know you know) the other day, and Tom likewise has a very high opinion of Barry.
 
We need well qualified judges in this district.  It is an extremely busy district with complicated cases.  Because Barry acted as a U.S. Attorney and has been a U.S. Magistrate for many years, he obviously is well qualified on the criminal side.  In addition, he was a civil litigator and acted as a state court judge; and so has extensive civil experience.  It is hard to find candidates who are qualified to hand both criminal and civil cases.
 
I would appreciate anything you could do.  Should you be in contact with the Governor, please feel free to send my comments on to him and, of course, send him my regards.
 
Thanks.  Best regards.
 
Mike

How are you Governor? Anyway, my name is Greg Galicia and I am a Filipino with a sprinkling of Spanish blood in me. I currently live in Daly City, California, as an unemployed Project Manager, I might add. I am considering moving to Florida. What are my chances of getting a job in your sunny state? How is the unemployment numbers in Florida? Living in California, especially in the Bay Area, is beginning to look like a joke. I don't like what Davis, our governor, has done to the state of affairs of our state. There is a recall petition currently in gear to recall him. Looks like he really messed up the energy situation here big time. 

I wish you the best of luck. I am a registered republican and I will vote for you when you decide to run for the Presidency in 2008, right after George W  two successive terms! Thank you.

Subject:	Kevin C. Smith #J07148/Florida State Prison Thank you and update 

Dear Jeb:
I appreciate all your help but things are getting worse since I've started
exposing the truth at FSP. I was able to scan a letter sent to me from an
anominous person at the prison warning me about exposing the truth. I marked
out their name and what they do to protect them from the good ole boys there
and this person is going to help me expose the truth. I also received a
letter from Kevin today that I was not able to scan clear enough to send the
original but will tell you what it said. I'm still learning how to use the
scanner I got for Christmas. It said at 4:35 a.m. he was attending a callout
to the clinic for them to test his blood. Well, C/O Hall was up there. He
asked Kevin his name and when he told him he said "Oh your the piece of
shit" Kevin said What did you say sir? He said "rather  your mother is "
Then he went on to threaten Kevin by saying  "You got your mom calling up
here about that bullshit" Well, I'm going to teach you  you just wait before
I am done you'll have about 2 or 3 DR's tell your mommy that. So Kevin said
he ignored him and filed grievances to his Lt. and the Colonel. Then a
couple of hours later they took him to see the inspector. This inspector is
incompetent, bias and has a really bad attitude. He weighted Kevin then
called him a liar and me a liar. He hardly let Kevin talk and when he tried
to defend his complaints he told him he had a smart mouth. He also said he
was going on the Internet and tell everyone that I was a liar and none of my
accusations are true. This guy is crooked they are true. Don't send him back
again and he needs to be fired for what he did and said. Kevin says he won't
listen to the truth but when you read the letter I received you will see we
are telling the truth and even some of the inspectors are crooked. After he
saw Kevin they sat him in a holding cell for over two hours. Kevin's said he
kept telling him he needed to go to the bathroom bad and they kept ignoring
him. He finally couldn't hold it any longer and wet the floor. Which then
pissed the Sgt. off, he really tried to hold it and told them and told them
but those jerks ignored him it was an accident. Now when is this going to
stop because I am not giving up till the truth is exposed even though now my
safety is jeopardized as well. I've already told everyone in prison reform
not to stop the fight to expose the truth if something happens to me. Please
get to the truth before its too late. Enclosed is the letter I received
warning me about Kevin and my safety. Thanks Jeb I know you will help once
again and don't give this to Judy Belcher she'll just give it back to the
good ole boys instead of getting to the truth and jeopardize Kevin and my
life more. Janice Smith

Janice Smith I know your son here at FSP I am an ~ and cannot give my name
please for your own
safety and the safety of your son be careful. And please realize that there
is a lot of good c.o.s here that come
to work and actually do there jobs and aren't in the mix of corruption that
goes on. I can give you more
information than any chaplain or classification officer I work the wings on
a daily basis and I know the truth
yes your son is a pain in the rear but so are the other 900 or so inmates
here but as far as dis respect and the
other bullshit no he is not the one and there is definitely some thing to be
said about the food. and further
more you should start looking really hard at the wing seargeant Reynolds,
Shawn and his felony convictions
and then raise the question as to why he is the one responsible for watching
over your son. Keep up the
vigilant work and maybe one day the walls will become transparent. May GOD

I'm an intelligence officer separating from the AF in June and going to work/grad school in DC in June. I was hoping I could tap your brain for a few points of advice.
 
I was wondering if you grew up with the drive for public service or did it just come naturally via familial influence. I have always had an odd, encumbering sense of destiny for public service. As a Christian, I wonder if it isn't the Lord pushing me towards it to use my gifts for His greater purpose but I've yet to reconcile this with the obvious potential for lustful human ambition. 
 
Any advice on how to figure this out? How did you know?

 Dear Governor Bush (and staff):

 
 You probably have all seen this one before, but if it is true, it is an extraordinarily powerful insight into how someone with greater 
 understanding of an issue than a senior individual can be ridiculed publically, and made to look the fool, when if he or she had been    
 listened to, an event as horrific as the loss of the twin Trade Center towers might have been totally avoided.  This tragic consequence 
 has been repeated over and over in our society in just my lifetime.  The Apollo tragedy, the Challenger disaster, and in time we will all
 learn that the Columbia shuttle loss could also have been averted if only senior people would start listening to junior people.  In the 
 the world of commerce, it is no different.  Look at the Enron case with Sherron Watkins, the Worldcom case with Cynthia Cooper, and  
 the FBI debacle with Coleen Rowley.  Same deal; the front office has its head up its proverbial rectum!  If our governments at all
 levels don't start listening to their lower and middle staff members who know more about the details of an issue than anyone in the 
 front office, we are going to continue to lose the big ones, the costly ones, the tragic ones.  I hope someone in the Oval Office is
 listening about going to war against Iraq.  I believe it is morally right to do so, but it must be done with the touch of a Solomon or we   
 could emerge a big loser again.
 
 Just some thoughts from a stupid old senior citizen; what the hell does he know!
 
 Dennis Auth
  guana@aug.com
  
 
Anyone remember this?? 

It was 1987! At a lecture the other day they were playing an old news video of Lt.Col. Oliver North testifying at the Iran-Contra hearings during the Reagan Administration. 

There was Ollie in front of God and country getting the third degree, but what he said was stunning! 

He was being drilled by a senator; "Did you not recently spend close to $60,000 for a home security system?" 

Ollie replied, "Yes, I did, Sir." 

The senator continued, trying to get a laugh out of the audience, "Isn't that just a little excessive?" 

"No, sir," continued Ollie. 

"No? And why not?" the senator asked. 

"Because the lives of my family and I were threatened, sir." 

"Threatened? By whom?" the senator questioned. 

"By a terrorist, sir" Ollie answered. 

"Terrorist? What terrorist could possibly scare you that much?" 

"His name is Osama bin Laden, sir" Ollie replied. 

At this point the senator tried to repeat the name, but couldn't pronounce it, which most people back then probably couldn't. A couple of people laughed at the attempt. Then the senator continued. Why are you so afraid of this man?" the senator asked. 

"Because, sir, he is the most evil person alive that I know of", Ollie answered. 

"And what do you recommend we do about him?" asked the senator. 

"Well, sir, if it was up to me, I would recommend that an assassin team be formed to eliminate him and his men from the face of the earth." 

The senator disagreed with this approach, and that was all that was shown of the clip. 


By the way, that senator was Al Gore 

Also: 

Terrorist pilot Mohammad Atta blew up a bus in Israel in 1986. The Israelis captured, tried and imprisoned him. As part of the Oslo agreement with the Palestinians in 1993, Israel had to agree to release so-called "political prisoners." 

However, the Israelis would not release any with blood on their hands, The American President at the time, Bill Clinton, and his Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, "insisted" that all prisoners be released. 
  
Thus Mohammad Atta was freed and eventually thanked the US by flying an airplane into Tower One of the World Trade Center. This was reported by many of the American TV networks at the time that the terrorists were first identified. It was censored in the US from all later reports.

Dear Governor Bush
Thank you for the consistent approach you have taken in guiding our state during these challenging times. I think they will continue to be with us for some time, and a steady long-term view is what we require to avoid unpleasant surprises.
 
I continue to be concerned about the long-term outlook for medical care in Florida (both availability and cost). I am very much against regulation, which I believe is anticompetitive and can lead to uneconomic outcomes. However, our state is clearly facing significant pressures in this area, which could badly impact medical care availability and cost. Perhaps some type of meeting with all of the stake holders might lead to some possible new approaches to the various aspects of this problem (availability, cost to consumers, quality of care, cost management to service providers, malpractice costs and awards, economic viability to service providers).
 
I do not have any recommended solutions for this problem. I am sure you have it on your radar and hopefully you will be able to provide guidance during your current term as governor.
 
Best wishes,

copy sent to Mayor Dermer:

Mayor Dermer,

As an active campaingn worker/volunteer for the Republican Party and a resident of Miami Beach, I am writing to express my concern regarding the Beach Patrol.  I walk on the beach regularly and I must admit that I fear the way the Beach Patrol drive.  It feels more like I95 than the beach.  What is the reason for the constant rush?  During lunch time it becomes busier and more traffic and mostly beach patrol.  I know that they are courteous but I often question the reason for all the traffic.  I know for a fact that there was an accident involving the beach patrol a while back in which they ran over someone (not fatal).  The officer was given a slap on the hand and placed back on the beach (patroling and driving).  I was surprised of this decision.  At the very least, he should never have been given  the opportunity to drive the vehicle on the beach EVER again.  And in all honesty, he should have been dismissed or placed elsewhere.  It is that important!!  That was just carelessness on the part of the department.  We pay taxes and give them raises and they should run the department in a more efficient manner with qualified personnel.  I am sure we will be paying dearly for this now.

Mayor DermerI, is it really necessary to have a heavy SUV constantly driving up and down the beach?  Shouldn't it be used in emergencies...or is lunch considered an emergency?  Why don't they use the 3 wheelers for transportation instead?  They are safe and cause less damage in case of an accident.  Afterall, we are volnderable and not expecting to encounter a vehicle when we go to the beach.  There are no traffic rules on the beach and I am afraid of being out there knowing I too could be run over.  How much of an emergency is a robbery compared to loosing a human life?  I feel I cannot relax out on the beach thinking I could be run over anytime by 1. bludozer 2. maintenance truck 3. hotel suv's 4. garbage truck 5. beach patrol 6. police vehicles 7. tourists illegally driving on the beach.  How many vehicles are there allowed to be on the beach?  In the back of my mind I always fear that an accident could happen even if they are very careful; I might as well sit out in the middle of Collins Avenue, it is about the same amount of traffic and I know to expect there to be.  In my estimate...this was bound to happen sooner or later, it is truly unfortunate for all of us.
I hope you can hear my concern and act on it as I wish to be assured safety here on the beach.

Sincerely,
Daisy Berman/Miami Beach

I know that you are swamped and I choose very carefully what to send to you. Things are getting "dicey" as I call it, with the districts right now. They are figuring out the FTE implications and beginning to deny kids. We are forwarding them to Mark as they come in and he is escalating appropriately. If you have any doubts about what we do in comparison to other providers - see the note from our teacher below to this parent. We do believe that every child can learn given the time and the proper instruction. 
Thanks for everything. You're awesome. Keep swimming up stream. You are one of the few to dare to do what's right even if it might be unpopular. I so applaud you.

Hi Terri,

Let me just start out by saying that "It does absolutely NO good
whatsoever to be on pace and not understand what you're doing."  The
public schools are full of kids like that and I would rather see my kids
fall a little behind pace and eventually grasp the concepts than keep up
with the assignments and not learn.

I'm glad her dad is able to help her out, but PLEASE don't hesistate to
call on me for that as well.  I can set up one/one chat to go over any
of the subjects.

So... did I answer your question?  Have her keep busy and we'll worry
about the pace later :-)

Hi Mr. Vangalis,

Ellie and I have been going over your comments in the post test for
module 5 and, while she understands some of the questions she had
problems with somewhat better, she's still a little confused and wants
to go over your replies with her father tonight and tomorrow.  She would
also like to work on the Module 5 analysis portion of the test with him
over the weekend.  He really does a good job of helping her understand
things -- it's just that we always have to wait until he gets a free
moment!

At any rate, I know this is going to set her further behind pace, which
was not our intention this week.  Can we readjust her pace to help her
get through this portion of the course?  I don't want to discourage her
when she's really trying, by hurrying her through things.  But I do want
her to continue to try to work at a pace that works well for her.

What do you suggest?

Thank  you for your help!

We have told you this over and over and yet you do nothing to stop this.  You only tell Regior who is in charge and allow him to police his own department and hide their own mistakes.  Why?????????????? even have a governor if he just won't do anything but hide his head in the ground and allow this agency to police itself?  We need help NOW.  Will you help us or not?

Dear Mr. Governor Bush

Political awareness is keeping up-to-date with current political and global 
issues or concerns, familiarizing oneself with the policies of the United 
States both on a domestic and international level, and being able to relate 
different issues to one's system of beliefs for the purpose of taking a 
stance on an issue instead of being indifferent and passive.

We are not trying to trap you in a political game. Rather, we are trying to 
support you by supporting political awareness through a student-run, 
non-partisan, non-profit organization labeled Junior State of America (JSA). 
As Co-Presidents of this organization's chapter at Pensacola High School, we 
are seeking to quote what you write as what you think "the importance of 
political awareness" is in a letter to political organization in our local 
area asking for donations in an effort to raise funds for attending the 
Southeast Regional summit for JSA this spring. We thought that instead of 
asking you for money and warrant a gentle dismissal of our club's purpose, 
we would approach this in a new manner. You really have nothing to lose if 
you can just provide us with a quote to put in our letter for donations for 
what you think "the importance of political awareness" is.

We appreciate with genuine gratitude your speedy response to our previous 
e-mail, and we look forward to quoting your rich and textual words in a 
forthcoming, fund-raising letter.

Sincerely,

Nupur Garg and Alessandra Carreon
Co-Presidents,
Junior State of America

Commissioner: 

I saw the post below from Brenda Dickinson in a Home Education group. Here are some of my thoughts to her comments.   

The object of free market principles in education would be of course to avoid additional regulation, in fact we should look at how we can further deregulate public schools.  But my experience in policy would be that the object is not to draw separate lines around each group (Home Education, Private Schools, Charter Schools), but rather to erase the lines and increase parental options and inject more market principles into the current system.  New Zealand is a good model of how that was done.  But at the end of the day 85% of children will still be in public schools.  Currently around 87% of children are in public schools in Florida, nationally the figure is about 3 points higher. It is very clear that Ms. Dickinson’s perception of public school choice programs is a false dichotomy of the argument.  What you have to make clear is your position of “empowering parents to choose the best education for their child: public, private or home education.”  If you allow school choice critics to paint the argument as a public versus private argument you will lose, whether those critics are on the left or the right.  The abortion argument was won, not because abortion rights advocates had a better argument, it was won because they made the issue about choice. In this game words really do matter.    

I am not sure if you are familiar with any of the policy papers I have written on the subject, but I have done several papers on merit pay for teachers, alternative teacher certification, teacher unions and lot’s of stuff on school choice----including a well quoted paper on critical mass of Charter Schools. Most of my work is available on the Internet (http://www.tppf.org, http://TNPolicy.org, http://www.heritage.org, http://www.heartland.org, and http://www.reason.org, http://www.childrenfirsttn.org).  The American Legislative Exchange Council used parts of my paper for recommended legislation on merit pay (http://www.alec.org), and I even spoke at their conference in 1999.  I spend so much time, as do you, putting out fires we never seem to be pro-active on issues and we never get a chance to talk.  Dr. Wood has a draft of some of my thoughts on the school choice office from last fall I would be glad to review it with you.  Can we meet at some point to discuss where you think we need to be going?  I want to be very much in the loop on this.  I am in all day Monday and Friday.  This is the week I am doing some events with Dr. Fair.   

Commissioner I am here to serve the Governor and you wherever you need me.  

Thanks!  J. C.

Subject: From HEF: an update  regarding Dr. Williams'

From Brenda Dickinson:
Leaders Update on the Office of Private Schools and Home Education
At the request of Commissioner Horne, I met with him today to 
discuss the hiring of Dr. Alex Penn Williams. She was hired for what 
is being called the Office of Independent Education and not for the 
Office Private Schools and Home Education. This has been the source 
of great confusion.

Commissioner Horne has been a long time friend, colleague and 
supporter of home education. I was very pleased when he was 
appointed Secretary in the transition phase of the educational 
governance reorganization. He has had an overwhelming number of 
issues to deal with since becoming Secretary in June 2001, and then 
Commissioner on January 7, 2003. He supported my efforts to 
downgrade the Division of Independent Education to an Office of 
Private Schools and Home Education. He supports parents' rights and 
the autonomy of the private sector. 

As he began to share his vision today for this new position, I 
realized that even though we share the same basic philosophy, he was 
missing a very important piece of information. He and the Governor 
have no desire to further regulate private schools or home 
education, yet both have failed to understand the distinction 
between private education and public school choice programs. 
Unfortunately, they are not alone. While they, and many others, are 
pushing for more choice programs for parents, they may inadvertently 
bring more regulation on private schools and home education programs 
if the programs are not designed very carefully. So far, most choice 
programs have provided, to parents, options without adding any 
additional regulation. The exception is the Opportunity Scholarship 
Program, which requires the students to take the FCAT test. 
Proponents of school choice have argued that the state dollars go to 
the parents in the form of scholarships that can be spent anywhere 
the parent chooses. The opponents, and some of the proponents, argue 
for accountability on the schools that receive state funding. 

I had the opportunity to speak before the House K-20 Committee 
yesterday, and I began my speech on legislative issues of importance 
to the private sector with maintaining our autonomy, independence 
and non-governmental status as our number one priority. I explained 
how public school choice programs are not synonymous with private 
education. You may read my speech on the HEF website (www.flhef.org) 
I gave a copy of that speech to Commission Horne today. We discussed 
my concerns of viewing private schools and home education as school 
choice programs when we are truly the only independent education in 
this State. He had never crystallized this in his mind before, and, 
based on this information, he was going to rethink his 
reorganization plan. 

Our meeting lasted for one and one half hours and I was unable to 
meet Dr. Penn Williams today. I believe that I will have the 
opportunity to work with Commissioner Horne as he reorganizes this 
section of the DOE. 

This has been a long and drawn out process. I was terrified of 
having a Division of Independent Education, under the governance of 
the State Board of Education, which would have made private schools 
and home education part of the system of public education. It took 
me two years to garner enough support to get this Division 
downgraded to an Office of Private School and Home Education. We 
worked hard last year to get language into the school code that 
specifically described the position, s. 1001.21, taking it out from 
under the direct governance of the State Board of Education and 
making it less visible. If we can find a way to protect home 
education and private schools in the new governance without having 
it placed under school choice or public schools, then we may make 
another change. I will be working with the Commissioner over the 
next several months to try to resolve this issue.

Subject:	Lakeland Ledger: Bush Shows Contempt for Library

Dear Governor Bush, See the article below. Floridians like me who care about Floriday history and culture would really like a response from your administration. This has gone too far.  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From The Ledger, 2/21/03:

Gov. Bush Shows Contempt for Library 

By James M. Denham

Gov. Jeb Bush plans to shut down the state library. 

He plans to pack up and scatter the library's books, microfilms, maps,
government documents and archival records accumulated since 1845 -- a
move that undermines years of careful work by professionals dedicated
to preserving these treasures for future generations.

His idea is bad for Florida and shows his total disdain for our
state's rich history.

Bush claims that Florida will save $5.4 million by cutting 55 state
jobs. 

He has not said how much it will cost to pack up, transfer and house
the millions of items that for so long have been professionally
managed under one roof. 

Nor has he stated how long this transferal will take, or if, when or
where these materials will be available to the general public. 

(Bush's original plan to ship the library's collection to FSUs
Strozier Library went nowhere.)

It is critical that the state library's priceless collection remain
intact, and that its librarians continue to provide for the orderly
acquisition, classification, organization, retrieval and preservation
of its important resources.

The state library manages archival and records services all across the
state. 

It also serves county library systems by coordinating the Florida
Interlibrary Loan Network. 

The proposed closure also threatens the Florida Memory Project, an
online database that makes available many of the state's historical
and genealogical records, tens of thousands of photographs and
manuscripts critical to an understanding of our state's past.

This source is indispensable to educators and the state's many new
residents desiring to learn about their new home's history.

Also at risk in the bureaucratic reshuffling is the Bureau of Historic
Preservation that encourages, promotes and assists
historic-preservation activities in every community in this state. 

Its regional offices are to be closed, leaving a skeleton staff in
Tallahassee to do the work of hundreds of dedicated professionals who
soon may join library and archive professionals in the ranks of the
unemployed.

Bush's scheme seems based on the mistaken premise that disbanding the
state library and archives will only inconvenience a few Florida
scholars -- that it will affect so few that no one will even notice. 

The threat of this move to the few remaining Florida history scholars
is real enough. 

But the real losers from Bush's plan will be genealogists, children
and the thousands of other Floridians who visit the R. A. Gray
building that houses the library, archives and museum collections.

Ironically, the nucleus of the state archives might have been lost in
the first place if state librarian Dorothy Dodd had not rescued the
cache of governors' papers and other precious state documents from the
trash bins when they were nearly thrown away by careless workers
during the state capital's remodeling in the 1950s.

Now, nearly 50 years of careful work by professionals who have built
up the collection is threatened by this reckless scheme. 

Also during that time, citizens from across the nation have donated
precious family heirlooms such as letters, diaries and photographs so
that they can enrich the lives of future generations. 

These donations were always made under the expectation that these
items would be professionally cared-for and preserved. 

Bush's plan threatens this public trust.

Bush's plan at first glance may seem easy to pull off in a state with
so many newcomers. 

A newcomer himself, Bush has shown time and again an astonishing
disregard for the state's cultural heritage. 

But this latest display of contempt has drawn a loud outcry from
state, national and even international sources. 

One might well wonder what that reaction would be if his brother
proposed abolishing the Library of Congress and the National Archives.

Commissioner:
 
FYI.  This fits into your recent comments on teacher pay.  --JCB
 
http://www.heartland.org/Article.cfm?artId=9288
 
 

Would Higher Teacher Salaries Improve Teacher Quality?

Weighing across-the-board increases vs. pay-for-performance

Author: Hanna Skandera and Richard Sousa
Published: The Heartland Institute 06/01/2002



Teacher union officials, and those steeped in the tradition of schools of education, assert that blanket increases in teacher salaries are one way to achieve an improved education system. They contend higher teacher salaries across-the-board would compensate for the increased responsibilities shouldered by teachers; bestow the proper respect on the teaching profession; and attract well-prepared candidates to the field. They maintain teacher salaries have not been competitive within the job market and, therefore, the profession has not attracted the “best and brightest.”

Others have challenged that view, questioning the wisdom of providing a blanket increase in compensation without a way to determine returns. If competitive teacher salaries are important, they argue, then an accountable and competitive environment should be part of the package: Market principles must be applied. Concerned about attracting better-qualified teachers and justifying salary increases in the face of falling test scores, some proposals have gone beyond across-the-board pay increases.


Focus on Outputs, Not Inputs

“Teacher compensation systems should be redirected from an input-driven system to an outcome-based system,” according to a Texas Public Policy Foundation study authored by John C. Bowman, now president of Children First Tennessee. Bowman and others recommend teacher compensation systems be modified in the following ways:

*	Superior teachers should earn more than average teachers;

*	Poorly performing teachers should be expeditiously removed from the school system;

*	Across-the-board pay hikes should be resisted and/or discontinued;

*	Teachers performing more difficult tasks should receive higher pay.

If the primary goal is to increase the supply of teachers—a serious concern in some districts—blanket increases in teacher salaries might be one solution. Bowman concludes, however, that when salaries go up schools run the risk of paying more for the teachers they already have, or simply increasing the supply of teachers without increasing their quality.

“[A]ttempts to recruit better teachers by using across-the-board raises for all teachers, irrespective of merit, makes no discernible impact on new teacher recruitment,” Bowman wrote in his report on teacher compensation.

The Upjohn Institute came to a similar conclusion after conducting several years of detailed empirical analyses of teachers in both the public and the private sector. The “dramatic increases in teacher salaries over the past twenty years have done nothing to improve the quality of American public school teachers,” the institute reported.


Linking Pay to Performance

Unlike the general labor force, where output is a key salary determinant, the field of education rewards experience and advanced degrees. What if teacher pay scales were linked to performance criteria and improved productivity, rather than to the level of pre-service training?

Dr. Myron Lieberman, chairman of the Education Policy Institute, believes that if this were done, more of the best and the brightest might be attracted to teaching, thus enhancing teacher quality and presumably improving student achievement.

“When salaries go up, schools simply pay more for the teachers they already have, rather than increase the quality of new hires ...” Lieberman says. “Unless teacher salaries are raised for outstanding teachers, or teachers whose talent is paid more in the private sector, it will be impossible to recruit the kind of teachers who can elevate the entire profession.”

Dear Governor Bush:
 
My apologies for not more carefully researching the background of the "Oliver North testimony" before I forwarded it to you and your staff.  Although I believe my observations about high eschelon staff and executives believing that it is not advantageous to be the bearer of bad news to their bosses at the top is true, often with dire consequences, I should have been more scrupulous in ascertaining the truth of the prophetic remarks attributed to Col. North before sending it to the Governor of the State.  The revelations about the Boeing engineering impact analysis in the Florida Times-Union today is shaping up to be yet another example of this strange reckless desire on the part of senior management officials to avoid concluding that anything could possibly be wrong in Camelot.  Yes men that are always right and true are unique indeed and would be a remarkable advantage for leadership, but yes men who are wrong because they are afraid to bring a negative forward to the top, are toxic indeed to leadership.
 
Actually, I should never forward anything originating from the Internet without an aggressive verification process.  I will not make this mistake again.

Reason to Unveil New Traffic Congestion Plan on Feb. 25

What if I told you there was a way to GUARANTEE a free-flowing lane of traffic, unimpeded by congestion, on all the major freeways in cities like Washington, DC, Los Angeles, or Seattle?    

Imagine a system of lanes that could provide high-speed buses for families that rely on mass transit?

Imagine being able to get on the freeway during rush hour to catch a plane and not have to factor an hour’s worth of traffic delays into your plans.  

Hard to believe, isn’t it?  

On February 25, Reason will share the platform with a diverse coalition of groups in our nation’s capital to show how, in fact, this system can be created without soaking the taxpayer.    

On that day, Reason will release a comprehensive plan that proposes congestion-free networks in eight major metropolitan cities.  We show that we can accomplish this by converting underutilized HOV lanes into high-capacity transit/toll lanes and using the toll revenues to build the system into seamless networks. 

The plan is already receiving strong support from environmental organizations, motorist groups, and others.

When: Tuesday, February 25, 10:30 am
Where: Rayburn House Office Building Room 2247, Washington, DC 

The study will be available in full text on Reason’s Web site on Tuesday, February 25 at http://www.rppi.org in the event that you are unable to attend.

TALLAHASSEE – Jeb Bush is talking, as he often does, about family.

"Although it is an intensely private -- and at times painful -- matter, you should know that I am rededicating myself to being a better father and husband," the governor says. He is giving his second inaugural address under a crystalline sky on the steps of Florida's Old Capitol. The crowd of 3,000 includes several people wearing "Jeb Bush for President in 2008" buttons.

The subtext is lost on no one. His 25-year-old daughter, Noelle, is on the stage, on a one-day leave from her court-ordered drug treatment program in Orlando. She is accompanied by a drug counselor. "I realize that any sense of fulfillment I have from this event is meaningless unless they too can find fulfillment in their lives," Bush continues, his voice quivering.

He is the Bush with the angst gene, who seems to labor through even his pinnacle moments. His capacity for public tears is impressive even by the weepy standards of the Bush family. He cried four times at his inaugural events last month -- one fewer than he did during "Forrest Gump."

It is, or should be, such a sweet scene. America's Little Brother, decisively reelected, gets sworn in on the same Bible his brother and father used in Washington. George and Bar sit point-'n'-waving at the front of the stage. Four F-15s scream overhead, and a National Guard unit fires 19 cannon blasts. George P. Bush, Jeb's 26-year-old son and the program's master of ceremonies, talks like he's already in Congress. The 41st president introduces Jeb. The 43rd president couldn't make it, but he's a busy man.

But it's never so simple with family dynasties. This is mercilessly true for John Ellis "Jeb" Bush.

Bush, 50, is best known for the melodramas that bubble around him. He is a shy public man who seems destined to suffer in the open. He is the Bush who has acknowledged marital strife, who cries while discussing his daughter's drug problems on the "Today" show -- the same show that repeatedly broadcast her mug shot after her arrest on drug charges -- whose wife's ill-fated Paris shopping spree made her a Leno punchline and whose handsome oldest son is a People magazine idol. And this doesn't include the famous family Jeb Bush was born into -- or, for that matter, the infamous election he was thrust into.

In the Bush family shorthand, Jeb was the anointed one: the driven big-thinker who started kindergarten a year early and graduated from the University of Texas in 2 1/2 years. He has succeeded by any measure: the first Republican to win reelection as Florida's governor. Some fans call him "Bush 44," kidding, sort of. (George P. is "Bush 45.") He might be the most closely watched U.S. politician outside Washington.

He cherishes these subtexts like gum surgery. Friends say Jeb Bush wants nothing more than to be left alone.

"He probably has as complex a situation to deal with as anyone in public office I've ever seen," says John Thrasher, a Tallahassee lobbyist and former state House speaker. He is referring to Jeb's web of public expectations and private circumstances.

To Jeb Bush, the governance of Florida is a precious space of his own authority, blissfully apart from everything else. "Florida, Florida, Florida," he says, declaring his focus. This is how he steers conversations away from national matters, especially those that concern his brother. This is smart politics, assuring everyone that his priority is his current job. But there's also a sense that Bush is protecting a refuge, one that is always under siege.

The E-Politician



A pre-inaugural barbecue in Miami is billed as a chance for Bush to mingle with his hometown admirers. But the governor spends most of his time in a VIP tent. When he comes out to work a quick rope line, his supporters, per custom, urge him to run for president. "Florida, Florida, Florida," he says in response to another question about whether he will.

Talking about his presidential plans, Bush says, "is like talking about whatever that group is from outer space." He is referring to the Raelians, the pro-cloning cult that has ties to Florida, naturally. "It's weird," Bush says of running for president. "I never think about it."

He shakes hands with a man in a yarmulke, one in a wheelchair and another in an Eminem shirt. Several people wear "Jeb!" and "I H Hooters" stickers, which are being slapped on zealously by volunteers (presumably unaffiliated).

Bush is 6 feet 4 and slightly heavyset with the beginnings of jowls. He lumbers from group to group, switching from English to Spanish. Bush hugs everyone he gets close to, or as best he can manage from behind a waist-high steel barrier. It's as close as he'll come to being a wade-into-the-crowd pol.

"You can understand the enormous comfort level he has with being governor," says Lanny Griffith, a Republican lobbyist and longtime friend. In Florida, Griffith says, "he doesn't have to have everything analyzed in terms of his brother or his dad."

Jeb Bush can be warm and approachable. But compared with the Georges, he keeps a discernible distance. He almost never grants face-to-face interviews and has particular disdain for the national media. They focus, inevitably, on his daughter, his wife, his brother, his father, 2000 or 2008.

Or worse, what Jeb deplores as "navel-gazing" themes, a powerful allergy in the Bush family.

Never Florida, Florida or Florida. He declined to be interviewed for this article, though a spokesman suggested questions by e-mail, the governor's preferred medium -- Bush gives out his Internet address to crowds (Jeb@Jeb.org) and invites citizens to write.

In dealing with the media, e-mail suits the governor's need for control. He picks what he wants to answer, can edit freely and "cc" whom he wishes. E-mail is also easy to ignore.

The Washington Post's trial e-mail to Bush concerns e-mail itself: When did he start using it? How often does he use it? What kinds of business does he use it for? It seems a harmless way to open a conversation. And Bush answers within an hour.

Thank you for writing. I started using email post 1994 but have been an active user since then. I use it now to keep me connected to friends and constituents. I learn from email from folks. I discount the organized email campaigns but I am respectful of the cause. I don't let the press go around our process (once anda while journalists get around them :) ) It is a huge productivity tool that allows me to be focused on the little things that are important all the while I stayed focused on my larger agenda. Happy New Year. 

Jeb Bush 

In three follow-up e-mails (which Bush also answers promptly), the governor reveals: He has three e-mail accounts, receives 200 to 300 a day on Jeb@Jeb.organd reads most of them. He guesses that 25 percent of the e-mails come from colleagues, 50 percent from constituents, 10 percent from family and friends and 15 percent from junk mail and list mail. The risk, he says, is in relying too much on e-mail, at the expense of face-to-face nuance. "There is always [the] threat of invading family time!" he writes.

He likes talking about e-mail. But when questions veer into other areas, the door closes. "I am skipping all of the questions," he writes. "I apologize." National attention, he reiterates, is a distraction. "My interest is Florida, Florida, Florida," he writes, and the e-mail proceeds in one long paragraph that concludes:

If you want to write an article about career service reform, I can lend a hand so long as it is not about me. If you are interested in how a state can reduce drug use, I am interested. You might be interested in how governments are embarkingon major technology projects, in which case you might want to look at what we are doing. Did you know that we are the first state to outsource the hr function of government? No profiles. 

Jeb Bush 

A Proud Mama's Boy



Jeb Bush can be easy to annoy.

"You don't have to do a lot to get under his skin," says U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek (D-Fla.), a former state legislator who clashed memorably with Bush. Three years ago, Meek and a colleague refused to leave the governor's office until Bush met with them to discuss a plan to eliminate race-based admissions preferences at state colleges. "Kick their asses out!" Bush snapped. It was not clear if Bush was referring to the legislators or the gathering press. Either way, film rolled and great TV ensued.

People close to Bush often feel protective of him. His political friends -- often the same ones who say it's futile to get to know him too well -- are also quick to profess loyalty. He projects vulnerability, with a mopey posture and fleshy face that seems to cry out for caretaking. He is the Bush with soft eyes -- not small and squinty like the Georges' or bugged like Barbara's.

"Jeb is the most gifted and talented person any of us have been around," says one former aide who asked not to be identified. "We would run through walls for him. And yet there's this faraway sadness about Jeb you can't miss."

"Jebby is a deep sensitive kid with lots of compassion and love in his heart," his father wrote in a diary entry in 1971 that was published in a book of the former president's letters. "But I worry that he may take on some crazy idea."

He is a proud mama's boy who was an infant when his next oldest sibling, Robin, died of leukemia at 3. Barbara Bush writes in her memoir that after Robin's death, "I devoted my time to our children, spending every single moment with Jebby, and then with Georgie when he came home from school."

The 6 1/2-year age difference between the Bush brothers precluded serious intimacy or rivalry. George W. was away at school for much of Jeb's childhood. As adults, they mostly communicated through their parents, or at family events.

When reporters sought comment for their Bush brother stories during their simultaneous campaigns for governor, George and Jeb were always blandly deferential -- Jeb saying how "proud" he was of George, and George saying that "Jeb is a good man."

There were some exceptions. At the 1996 Republican convention, Jeb told a reporter for the St. Petersburg Times about the time George W. was "caught finger painting with something other than his fingers." (It is not clear how old the president was at the time of the finger-painting episode.)

George W. calls Jeb my "big little brother" during appearances (Jeb is five inches taller), and Jeb dutifully plays the goofy sidekick. He introduces George as "my older, smarter and wiser brother."

Like George W., Jeb loves to tout his admiration for his mother -- which is also smart politics, given her popularity -- but in a way that can occasionally be treacly. At his inaugural prayer breakfast, Jeb turns to his mother, shakes his head and lowers his voice. "When I came into the world and woke up, there I was, lying right next to Barbara Bush."

He was not as mischievous as George W., but could be bold and unpredictable. "Jebby is going to need some help I am sure," his father wrote in 1971. "He is a free and independent spirit and I don't want him to get totally out of touch with the family."

Like his brother and father, Bush attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass. Jeb struggled with his course work, missed Texas and experimented with marijuana. He met his future wife as an exchange student in the Central Mexican city of Leon during his senior year. His devotion to Columba Garnica Gallo was avid and obvious from the start. It was also of great concern to his parents. "How I worry about Jeb and Columba," Barbara Bush wrote in a diary entry. "Does she love him?"

Jeb married Columba Feb. 23, 1974, in the University of Texas chapel. Columba was 20. Jeb was 21, the first of the Bush children to wed.

They eventually settled in Miami, where Jeb would begin a lucrative career as a real estate developer and become active in local Republican circles. As a pugnacious candidate for governor in 1994 -- his first run for elected office -- Bush called himself "a head-banging conservative" and expressed fondness for the TV show "American Gladiators." Women on welfare, he said, "should be able to get their life together and find a husband." He spoke of "blowing up" state agencies. In response to a question about what his administration would do to help African Americans, Bush's answer included the memorable words "probably nothing."

A firestorm ensued, one of many "distractions" that Bush would complain about during his campaign against Gov. Lawton Chiles. Another involved comparisons to his father, with one theory positing that Jeb's brashness was a clumsy attempt to forge his own political identity.

Then there was the unforeseen distraction: George W. Bush decided to run for governor of Texas, even though Jeb was assumed to be the Bush most likely to succeed his father in the family spotlight. In a show of pique, Jeb complained that the Bush brother act would render their campaigns "a cute People magazine story."

Except that Jeb lost, George W. won and Jeb's People magazine story was just starting.

A Full Day's Work



During the 1994 campaign, a reporter asked Columba Bush the name of the Spanish language book she was reading. "It is called 'Secrets About Men That Every Woman Should Know,' " she said. "We've been together 20 years and you stay that way by keeping the romance going."

In fact, their marriage was falling apart. By Jeb's admission, he had neglected his family. Columba's unease with public life had been clear during the campaign. She once complained within earshot of reporters that she "didn't ask for this."

Following his defeat, Bush underwent what he called a "personal transformation" that included a reevaluation of his political, spiritual and family life. Raised an Episcopalian, he began taking classes in the Catholic faith, Columba's religion. He converted to Roman Catholicism in 1996.

He started a conservative foundation, worked with minority groups and began using words like "compassionate" in speeches. He ran for governor again in 1998 and won.

Even with his softer oratory, Bush blowtorched his way into Tallahassee. "A lot of people approach public policy as problem solvers," says U.S. Rep. Tom Feeney (R-Fla.), a former state House speaker and Bush's running mate in 1994. "And Jeb wants to solve problems. But he truly wants to do it in the most conservative way possible."

He introduced a host of what he called "BHAGs" -- Big Hairy Audacious Goals, a notion coined by leadership guru Jim Collins, author of "Built to Last" and "Good to Great." Bush urged his staff to set BHAGs in areas such as education, where he became the first governor to introduce a statewide school voucher plan.

He hired driven, policy-oriented aides, usually under 40 years old, to better endure his round-the-clock demands. Bush can be a head-banging micromanager. 

At an open house at the governor's mansion after his inauguration, Bush instructed a young aide on where to stand to insure that the receiving line moved efficiently. 

"He has 19 hands on both arms and is involved in every phase of what everyone is doing," says Tom Slade, the former chairman of the Florida Republican Party.

"Jeb once made the comment that he loved vacationing in Kennebunkport in the summertime," says Feeney. "You know what his reason was? Because it's the place in the country where the sun comes up first. So when it's 5:30, when he's on his e-mail talking to his staff down in Florida, he can watch the sun come up."

He questions relentlessly and disputes small points. "He seems to know exactly what you don't want him to ask you," says Mac Stipanovich, a Tallahassee lobbyist and longtime associate. He'll bring up an obscure similar proposal that failed three years earlier in another state.

"If you think all you have to do is walk in there and slap him on the back, he'll eat your lunch."

His staff, while loyal, tends to turn over quickly. He can be excruciating to negotiate with. "He absolutely will not compromise until he is backed into a corner," says Tom Rossin, a former Democratic leader in the Florida Senate. "You have a sense that he [Jeb] needs to prove something, that he has a chip on his shoulder."

But Bush has a stubbornness that can seem born of a righteous crusade. In his inaugural address, he fantasizes about the government buildings of Tallahassee becoming "empty of workers." The buildings, he says, would become "silent monuments to a time when government played a larger role than it deserved."

Bush is bored with incremental progress. The Florida constitution mandates that this must be his last term. He is a man in a terrific hurry. 

At the Inaugural Ball, there is a running slide show that plays over the $100-a-ticket "black tie and blue jeans gala." The slides reveal the governor in a series of leaderly settings -- looking stern at a meeting, laughing amid a cluster of racially diverse children.

But the slide that draws the most notice is one of Bush collapsed over his laptop. He is asleep, or pretending to be. It suits the recurring message: Governor Bush is chronically logged on.

In Sickness and in Health



Columba Bush was on Capitol Hill recently in her role as spokeswoman for the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse. She is 5 feet 2, has perfect red lipstick and, battling a cold, is trailed by the faint essence of Hall's cherry lozenges. She is listening to Joseph A. Califano, the former secretary of health, education and welfare, who is addressing a news conference in the Russell Senate Office Building. Columba Bush, who will speak next, sits perfectly still.

Califano is listing factors that make young women susceptible to drug and alcohol abuse. He mentions high-stress environments, big life transitions. Parents need to be closely involved with their children, he says. They need to be attuned to warning signs.

Columba Bush walks slowly to the lectern when she is introduced. She reads in thickly accented English, appearing uneasy. She never looks up and doesn't mention Noelle.

After she speaks, a reporter asks if her daughter's plight has been exacerbated by being part of a political family. "Absolutely," she says, starting to elaborate, then stopping.

She has rarely spoken to the press since June 1999, when she was fined by U.S. customs agents for not declaring $19,000 in clothes and jewelry she bought in Paris. "I did not ask to join a famous family," she said at the time while apologizing. "I simply wanted to marry the man I loved."

Bush considered not running for a second term last year after Noelle was caught trying to buy Xanax with a fake prescription. It was discussed seriously for a few months within his family, sources close to both Jeb and Columba Bush say. But that was ruled out, largely because Jeb was so attached to his job.

When she is asked last week if her husband came close to not running, Columba Bush gives a firm answer. "No," she says.

"He always wanted to run."

They never talk about politics, Columba has said, and while many political couples say this, Columba's detachment from her husband's political self is striking.

No one can understand a marriage from the outside, but the occasional tidbit escapes about the Bushes. Jeb has volunteered that Columba is the only woman he has ever slept with. They attend church and pray together. They go out for Mexican food. 

Their three children are all grown and out of the house -- the youngest, Jebbie, 19, is a freshman at the University of Texas. 

The governor tries to be home by 6:30 p.m. and returns to work afterward, often via e-mail or phone. He holds policy meetings on Saturdays and plays golf early Sunday mornings. 

They have a black lab named Marvin and a Siamese cat named Sugar. Sugar reportedly sleeps on the governor each night. But Jeb disputes this, and it is a matter of enough import that he breaks his silence.

"Jeez," the governor writes in an e-mail. "Sugar sleeps on a red blanket at Colu and my feet every night. 

"This is going to be quite a profile. I am not worth it."

He ignores a follow-up question.

Family Style



Bush has made "strengthening the family" a signature BHAG of his second term. "It is my ambitious goal to provide the catalyst, in small ways and large, that will bring our families together," he says in his inaugural address. "I, for one, intend to begin with my own family."

"I wasn't saying that I'm a horrible dad," Bush told reporters after the ceremony. But Noelle Bush's drug problems and Columba's discomfort with public life bring questions about Jeb's priorities. 

On the day Noelle was arrested last year, people wondered how he could adhere to his existing schedule. Or why he wasn't with his daughter in court last October, when she was sentenced to 10 days in jail after crack cocaine was found in her shoe at her drug treatment center. Jeb said he stayed away so it wouldn't appear that he was trying to influence the judge.

"I think he has his arms around his family situation," says Al Cardenas, the chairman of the Florida Republican Party and a longtime Bush ally. "But you can't say he spends as much time as he'd like to. There's no doubt when you live that intensely to serve others, you have to constantly balance things. You have to sacrifice."

Whatever strain his family has placed on Bush, a former aide says, he suffers alone. He prefers realms -- such as government -- where he can achieve tangible results. 

He has convened a panel of advisers to make suggestions about strengthening marriages. "Real-life family situations are messy and gray," the former aide says. "So I think Jeb prefers talking about family challenges in terms of public policy."

Last Saturday at 12:43 p.m., before embarking on a trade mission to Spain, Jeb Bush responds to a final e-mail from The Post. The seriousness of his marital problems had been overstated, he writes. "I worked very hard to get elected in 1994 and had to spend too much time away from home. There were no marital difficulties beyond the normal." He says he spends more time with his wife as governor than he did before. 

"I still work hard, maybe too hard, but I organize my life better to hang out with Columba. I stay in regular touch with my kids. I wish we could do more things together. When we are all together is when I am the most happy, by far!" 

By Jeb Bush's rendering, the picture is clean. He loves his job, he loves his family. The melodramas and the subtexts are a media invention.

"You are very correct about my views on navel-gazing," Bush says, concluding his e-mail, fully engaged, albeit facelessly.

Dear Governor Bush and staff,
 
It has come to my attention that Dr. Williams has been hired to oversee the Office of Non-Public and Home Education.  As a home educator and mother of 4, I do not feel that Dr Williams will accurately represent my needs, nor do I feel that she is qualified to oversee home schoolers.  With her background, she cannot possibly understand the heart and purpose of homeschooling our children, nor the extraordinary results that are gained from long term homeschooling (not a year to year evaluation.)
 
I began homeschooling as a result of having a special needs child with a low learning ability.  By public school standards, she would have been labeled as retarded, or, at best, slow.  Through homeschooling, she has been able to achieve beyond what anyone thought possible.  She is learning far above her former school's expectations, however, still being learning disabled, she cannot be expected to test to the level of her chronological peers.  Would Dr Williams understand that?  She would not, unless she had personally met my daughter.  My other children are above average in learning ability, testing as far as 2 levels above their chronological grade.  
 
Without knowing our children, and understanding the methods and purpose of homeschooling, Dr. Williams cannot accurately oversee our children.
 
Thank you for your time.
 
Sincerely,
Paige Roberts

Subject:	Repeal/Ammend Fla Chapter Law 2002-269:

           

             Eagle Forum of Sun Country

February 24, 2003

Dear Governor Bush,

Thank you for standing strong on so many Republican issues and some non-partisan issues which are good for the state of Florida, as well as the rest of the nation. However, there is one issue, thought by many to have gone awry. "Eagle Forum," along with "ALEC" and the "Association of American Physicians & Surgeons" (AAPS) were adamantly opposed to the Clinton Administration/CDC (39 page) written "Model State Emergency Health Powers Act,"(MSEHPA) which was modified and introduced (SB1262) by Brown-Waite/Green. It was voted for on the very last day of the 2002 session, with little legislative review, discussion or understanding of what a totalitarian law, the now, Florida Law Chapter 2002-269 really was, starting with handing over sole authority for 60 day rolling periods to the State Health Officer during a loosely defined, declared public health emergency. 

Seemingly planned as an underhanded "last day" vote, it slipped under the wire, was passed, and signed into law on May 23, 2002, unnoticed by the unsuspecting public, without opposition , simply because no one was made aware of it. It was even missed by those of us who were on the look out for it. 

In July, 2002, there was a debate (pros/cons of Law 2002-269) at the Marion County Republican Executive Committee, between Renee Alsobrook (legal council for Florida State Health Dept.) and Andy Schlafly (legal council for the AAPS). Afterwards, the Committee voted to send a packet (will include in a follow-up mailing to you) to each county Republican Executive Committee, with our concerns. They were asked to contact their legislators to repeal or amend this law in the 2003 session.

Please review Florida Law Chapter 2002-269, keeping in mind our referenced concerns (red highlighted text of the law, and our own comments/questions in parenthesis, which are also red highlighted). We await your response and suggestions as to what we can do to repeal or amend this statute:

Section 1. Subsection (6) of section 381-0011, Florida Statutes, is amended to read: 

381-0011 duties and powers of the Department of Health. ---it is the duty of the Department of Health to:

(6) Declare, enforce, modify, (solely, by the Health Officer?) and abolish quarantine of persons, animals and premises as the circumstances indicate -----

(a) The (Health) Department shall adopt rules (who adopts these rules, and could they come from the pages of the Federal MSEHPA?) to specify the conditions and procedures for imposing and releasing a quarantine. The rules must include provisions related to:

1. The closure of premises. (Define how and exactly what "closure" entails. Allows public health officials to seize and control personal property).

 2. The movement of persons or animals exposed to or infected with a communicable disease (Aren’t animals the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture? In other state’s law derived from MSEHPA {many states totally rejected MSEHPA} it is spelled out that the people may be quarantined in their own homes, not in a common areas. No one considered the multitude of problems and expense of housing possibly thousands of people.)

 (And):

 3. The tests or treatment, including vaccinations, for communicable disease required to employment or admission to the premises (to common areas?) or to comply with a quarantine (forcibly moved to a common area? And, what if a person does not choose to be vaccinated? According to this it seems you can, under certain conditions refuse above vaccinations, etc.,{see Section 2, 4.} however, you must be vaccinated or be moved to a common quarantine area, according to this statute. Furthermore, such a person may prefer to stay home and not want to be exposed to the other possibly infected people in the common area. What is the solution to this dilemma)?

 4. Testing or destruction of animals with or suspected of having a disease transmissible to humans. (Isn’t that the duty of the Department of Agriculture, and not the State Department of Health? Valuable animals could be needlessly destroyed, and also without any future responsibility or accountability). 

 7. Methods of quarantine. (Define methods to be used).

 (b) Any health regulation that restricts travel or trade within the state may not be adopted or enforced in this state except by authority of the (Health) Department. (Which departments’ authorities are being usurped by the State Health Department, here)?

 Section 2. Section 381-00315, Florida Statutes, is amended to read:

-----the State Health Officer is responsible for declaring public health emergencies (define emergencies) and issuing public health advisories.

(1) As used in this section, the term:

(a) -----the State Health Officer is authorized to take any action appropriate to enforce any public advisory (define what actions he has sole authority to use for enforcement).

 (b) (Be more definitive as to what a "public health emergency" consists of). ----Prior to declaring a public health emergency, the State Health Officer shall, to the extent possible, consult with the Governor ------. The declaration of a public health emergency shall continue (will continue) until the State Health Officer finds that the threat or danger has been dealt with to the extent that the emergency conditions no longer exist and he or she terminates the declaration. However, a declaration of a public health emergency may not continue for longer than 60days unless the Governor concurs in the renewal declaration. (Governor and Legislative powers are relinquished during, possible rolling 60 day periods)! The State Health Officer, upon declaration of a public health emergency, may (is free to) take actions that are necessary (define extent of necessary actions) to protect the public health. Such actions include, but are not limited to:

 1. Directing manufacturers of prescription drugs or over-the-counter drugs who are permitted under chapter 499 and wholesalers of prescription drugs located in this state who are permitted under chapter 499 to give priority to the shipping of specified drugs to pharmacies and health care providers within geographic areas that have been identified by the State Health Officer. The State Health Officer must identify the drugs to be shipped. Manufacturers and wholesalers located in the state must respond to the State health Officer’s priority shipping directive before shipping the specified drugs.

 2. Notwhitstanding chapters 465 and 499 and rules adopted thereunder, directing pharmacists employed by the department to compound bulk prescription drugs and privide these bulk prescription drugs to physicians and nurses of county health departments or any qualified person authorized by the State Health Officer for administration to persons as part of a prophylactic or treatment regimen. (1.&2. Allow public health authorities to engage in quota setting and rationing drugs , but does not specify the manner in which these items would be rationed. Ignores potential costs, both dollar and human). 

 4. ----Individuals who are unable to or unwilling to be examined, tested, vaccinated or treated for reasons of health, religion or conscience may be subjected to quarantine ("movement of persons or animals," Section 1,A,2, moved to where? -- define. And, a person must be vaccinated to be moved to a common quarantine area with others).

 a. Examination, testing, vaccination, or treatment may be performed by any qualified person authorized by the State Health Officer. (A person may prefer to see his own physician who has his medical records. Will that be allowed).

b. ----the State health Officer may use any means necessary to vaccinate or treat the individual. (By any definition, this should be stricken).

Any order of the State Health Officer given to effectuate this paragraph shall be immediately enforceable by a law enforcement officer under s.381.0012. (The State Health Officer has direct authority over Law Enforcement?; not good).

 Section 3. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (2) of section 768.13, Florida Statutes are amended to read:

----

(2)(a) -----shall not be held liable ----any act or failure to act in providing of arranging further medical treatment 

-------. (There should be more responsibility and accountability for what may take place).

 4. -----initiate disciplinary action (by whom, the Health Dept. Officer?) against the facility pursuant to chapter 395. (Could clinics or doctors lose licenses if, a doctor refuses to vaccinate a particular person, believing, in his professional opinion, whether or not the person is willing, that a vaccinate would cause severe illness or death? Statistics do show that a certain percentage of people do die, or have severe reactions from the vaccinations)?

 

_______________________________________________________________________________________

Many Floridians consider the above concerns to be very serious. Who knows who the future Governors or State Health Department Officers might be? Because of this, the similar law in some other states carry a "sunset provision." Why does Florida not have a "sunset provision" for such a totalitarian law? It is also troublesome that Florida’s version is the very worst in the nation.

We have been told that this law/statute means nothing because the Governor can intervene at any time (even during the specified "untouchable" 60 day period). However, its language takes great pains to spell out just the opposite. We simply cannot trust that this may, or may not be understood. In an emergency there is no time for power struggles, or debate in a court of law, or anywhere else. 

The "unelected" State Health Department Officer is given far too much unaccountable authority, usurping the position of the office of the Governor and the Legislators, as well as other departments’ decisions, duties and functions. It cannot be stressed enough that the statute strips the State Legislature of all power and transers the power to an unelected official in the State Health Department. This is anti-democratic and anti-Republican. 

It is also known that Bin Laden’s family owns a good portion of Carlisle Companies Incorporated, which supplies many of the very vaccines we would be using on our own people. We must say, in more than ways than one, this is disturbing , even scary, and does not set well with those of us privy to such information. Such information certainly seems vitally important to the safety of our people. Therefore, we are asking you to look into this connection. 

We realize a plan is necessary, but in the name of freedom, this one is bad in so many ways for Florida and America.

We await your suggestions as to what we should/can do to repeal, or severely amend Florida Law Chapter 2002-269. Thank you, Governor Bush.

Hello Fellow Texas -Exes:

Just a reminder about the Texas Independence Day Celebration at El Chico's on Sunday, March 2, 2003 from 4-6 PM.  Hope you can join us.  How many times did you go to El Chico's in Austin?  It'll be like a flashback!

It'll be a cash bar.  We're getting a break on the drinks.  We'll sell drink tickets.  Any excess funds will go to the UT Scholarship Fund.  If you want to bring a new or gently used book for Governor Bush's Just Read, Florida program, that'd be great.

Marion Hoffmann and I had no idea there were 133 alums in Tallahassee.  If you've already RSVP'd, you don't need to email me again.  If I haven't heard from you, please reply.  We have 25 RSVPs already.  That's more than the alumni office said to expect.  

Look forward to seeing you.  Hook 'em Horns!

Subject:	International Alternative Health Centers for women, children and the disabled

Please will you help me to be part of this?
 
http://www.benedictinn.org/wtbg.htm
 
AND, this retreat center -- the buildings and facilities look perfect for the Center of Excellence proposal for Levy County Florida, Willston area...and Our Lady of All Nation, as well as the international women and children's health and advocacy center proposed for that area...
 
I think perhaps Disney, Florida Hospital, Mercy health care and the Celebration, Florida community may be willing to help us build it including a center for using the Holistic Arts in Health and healing too!  And, even some of the homeless disabled vets here in Gainesville, with whom I have been working at St. Francis House, who are about to be put out on the street, indicated they are willing to help pitch in.  
 
Tomorrow, I will be meeting with Viane Marchesse, the homeless vets rep at the VA here in Gainesville about getting immeidate emergency relocation and shelter assistance via the RED CROSS for the walking wounded being help hostage "by the system" ,at St. Francis House.
Why, if need be, the VA can set up rural clinics and treatment centers for the Vets out in camps and retreat centers like Camp Kalaguha, and let the DV teach kids how to take CARE of them!  
 
The Kids from University of Florida Student Coalition for the Homeless, Habitat for humanity, Loew's Building supply and some others have told me they are willing to pitch in to help us build it! 
 
Holy Family Catholic in IMPOVERISH LEVY COUNTY Florida has 6 building lots that were beqeathed to them by a parishoner. This seem it to be a wonderful place to start building Kid Powered Healthy Communities by working together as an ecummenical community to meet some of the immediate and emmergent housing needs of those in the area.  
 
All in all, it seems that God is blessing us, and bringing together the fruits of His LABOR of love...and soon it may be time for us to Celebrate Royally!
 
So, what do you say, how can you help me to make this dream, this vision of health and peace a reality for women, children, and the disabled?
 
I look forward to your positive and creative reply in the very near future,
 
Heartfully yours,
Patricia Stackfleth Ducher

Subject:	NEW EVIDENCE.... ASAP!


Mr. Amos King, Black Prisoner
Set for a "legally defective" execution...
Address: Florida's Death Row


Hello Amos,

The mere thought of Florida executing an innocent man because of
judicial and police corruption makes me sick!!

Was your "Judge Andrews", the same "Dishonorable Michael J. Andrews",
the very dishonest, biased, sarcastic, arrogant and corrupt black man
from Tarpon Springs who works at the 49th Street Criminal Justice
Center?

Let me know asap by return e-mail!

Give me your prison phone number and your lawyer's phone numbers and
your supporters' phone numbers.... NOW!

From the press stories about you and the "alleged honest" police
witnesses....... most uninformed people (like the uninformed jury
members) would have said, "Fry that SOB, Amos King!" 

......however, when I realized you were in front of two of the most
corrupt Judges in Pinellas Country, Florida's most corrupt county......
I dug into this case starting yesterday.

..... they have both swindled you out of your guaranteed right to a fair
trial and they just think you deserve no fair trial motions to have
their continued bias and conspiracy covered-up to save the political
face of lawyer Cole and themselves at all costs..... even if they MURDER
you as their "final solution and cover-up".  

Both Judge Andrews and Susan Schaeffer are well known liars under oath
and I may have federal cases that will show Gov. Bush, that...... "had"
Schaeffer been exposed, and Andrews exposed and others like the drunk
and criminal Judge Charles W. Cope, as the Florida laws mandate... they
would not have even been on the bench to have conspired to cover-up the
hard facts and evidence that would've set you free.

They would have been impeached and in prison for judicial corruption and
sexual favors, both heterosexual and homosexual.... the courts and
numerous judges in Pinellas County have made a "sewer" out of the rules
of criminal law and evidence..... Rondolino was Schaeffer's political
pet.  There's drug use and dealing and money and federal bank/contract
fraud.  

I was told yesterday, that both Judges have "fixed" criminal cases and
we are getting people to now come forward..... some will no doubt have
good evidence of corruption on your politically fixed criminal case as
well..... when the U.S. Attorney has these people picked up on Federal
Grand Jury indictments and when they all roll over on each other and the
crooked detectives they will admit they never gave you a fair trial and
they had knowingly withheld criminal evidence that someone else killed
that woman and they almost murdered an innocent man..... Mr. Amos King.

Eight of these "once honest and trusted" Florida Sheriff's deputy
detectives were recently all arrested by U.S. Federal Marshals for
felony corruption and fixing criminal cases with planted or withheld
evidence at criminal trials...... EIGHT OF THEM..... they called
themselves the "Delta Squad"..... like some tough military war gang.
They soon rolled over on each other in court to plea out some prison
"deals"..... think how many innocent people they've put in prison or
worse.
    
They're other numerous victims of corrupt Judge Michael Andrews and
Judge Susan Schaeffer who are afraid to come forward to defend your case
as they are in fear for their lives for Whistle-Blowing on the corrupt
justice and criminal police racketeering in the Sixth judicial Circuit.

These are two high profile judges who regularity cover-up and distort
the facts and exculpable criminal evidence that will set you free.  Jeb
Bush should put you into a "life sentence status" and then let these DOJ
investigations continue to get this new evidence uncovered and published
about corrupt Judges Andrews and Schaeffer and then let the DOJ's IGO
and Public Integrity task force out of Washington, put criminal pressure
on these people to finally get the truth out in the open.  I know they
are both dirty and corrupt with ironclad proof on the record and via new
testimony!

Without "all" of the evidence, you haven't had a fair jury trial.....
you've had a mock circus called Florida's justice system.  I'm going on
61 and a vet and I just recently found out about the horrible judicial
corruption in Pinellas County.

I have the DOJ now looking into the corruption of both of these judges
and if they discover more criminal wrong doings by these judges, they
may well turn on each other and testify that they were knowingly
corrupting the truth and your civil rights to a fair trial.

IF YOU WERE BEFORE JUDGE MICHAEL F. ANDREWS AND JUDGE SUSAN F.
SCHAEFFER, YOU WERE IN FRONT OF TWO KNOWN "CRIMINALS IN ROBES" WHO HAD A
CLEAR CRIMINAL BIAS AGAINST YOU.

I CAN PROVE THIS WITH NEW EVIDENCE AND TESTIMONY THAT IS COMING FROM AN
INVESTIGATOR FROM THE DOJ'S PUBLIC INTEGRITY SECTION AND OIG IN
WASHINGTON, D.C. AND THIS NEW EVIDENCE MUST BE PROVIDED TO YOUR DEFENSE
LAWYERS AND THE GOVERNOR VIA AN "EMERGENCY MOTION TO STAY".

THEY WILL ATTEMPT TO LABEL ME A SUPPORTER OF YOU..... I'VE NEVER EVEN
HEARD OF YOU UNTIL YESTERDAY AS I WAS INVESTIGATING JUDGE SCHAEFFER FOR
HER CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES FOR THE DOJ INVESTIGATORS.

I AM WHITE, A BAPTIST, AND WHEN I TRIED TO LET THE NORTH PINELLAS COUNTY
BLACK HISTORICAL SOCIETY HAVE TEMPORARY USE OF BUILDINGS AND SOME OF MY
PROPERTY FOR BLACK HISTORY IN OZONA, MY CAR AND BOATS WERE FIREBOMBED.

MY ANIMAL'S BELLIES WERE SLIT OPEN AND THROWN ON MY STEPS, ALL OF MY
TIRES SLASHED AND SOME BUILDINGS SEVERELY DAMAGED BY COUNTY EQUIPMENT
AND NOBODY WILL EVEN TAKE A CRIME REPORT AND BERNIE MC CABE'S STAFF AND
THE SHERIFFS SAID TO GET OUT OF TOWN, WHITE NIGGER "BOY".  

DAVID DUKE WAS BORN IN MY TOWN AND THE ONLY BLACK HANGING WAS IN OZONA
AS IT WAS A BIG KKK "HATE CRIME" AND "FLORIDA TERRORIST" CENTER AND
STILL IS.  THE NAACP KNOWS THIS AND IS ALSO VERY AFRAID OF THE CORRUPT
SHERIFF.

OTHER GOVERNMENTAL OFFICIALS CALLED ME A "WHITE NIGGER", "WHITE TRASH"
AND I WAS BATTERED TWICE AND ASSAULTED BY A SHERIFF AND HAD A STROKE ON
TAPE.... (THREE DAYS IN THE E.R.).... AND SPECIAL INTERNAL AFFAIRS
SHERIFFS DETECTIVES DESTROYED THE VIDEO TAPED PROOF AND SAID IT "NEVER
HAPPENED".....

NOW, MANY CITIZENS ARE JUST EXPOSING THESE NUMEROUS CRIMES (LAST WEEK ON
TV), JUST LIKE YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH, YOU MUST HAVE YOUR DEFENSE LAWYERS
ADVISE THE GOVERNOR OF THIS NEW EVIDENCE OF JUDICIAL CORRUPTION AND
POLICE EVIDENCE CORRUPTION.... YOU HAVE "NEVER HAD AN HONEST TRIAL" ....
IF YOU HAD THOSE TWO CORRUPT JUDGES..... 

GOV. JEB BUSH AND HIS FAMILY DO NOT WANT YOUR INNOCENT BLOOD ON HIS
HANDS NOR HIS BROTHER'S HANDS FOR LETTING TWO CORRUPT JUDGES LET YOU BE
MURDERED....

Look at all of the innocent men they've already murdered...... Judge
Schaeffer smiles and is proud when she is called "The Dean Of Death"!!
She's mentally sick with her own sick reputation for being tough and
unjust.  My life has already been threatened by Pinellas County
officials for speaking out for justice and the constitution.

An innocent man must "never" give up.... I'm not, John

Subject:	proposed RULE banning Pen-Pals of inmates!!

Governor Bush,

RE: Mail RULE #8 in Chapter 33 (FL administrative code pertainging to inmate mail)

The Dept of Corrections now is attempting to further isolate inmates from the outside by banning Pen-Friend websites.

This violates my constitutional rights as a FREE citizen within Florida to publish and host a Pen-Friend Site for inmates.

Pen-Friends do indeed, help to rehabilitate inmates.
Unfortunately the State Of FL does NOTHING to rehab
but rather they keep the revolving door turning to assure their JOB SECURITY.

Please Gov Bush, intervene and continue to allow Pen-pals (Pen-Friends) of inmates to the "free" world.

Sincerely,
Ms. Dyess
Jacksonville, FL

Glad you are back in the US.  I am in DC this week too.  I hope your trip is productive and you get some family time with your bro.

In the meantime, I continue to sing your praise and I am continuing to help David recruit strong candidates for your team....

As you may have heard Karen Johnson-Street is interested in coming back to Florida.  I am also working on opportunities for her hubby Ted Street at BOE.  I have arranged a call w/ him and Jim Horne.

I am excited about Fred Mattingly joining BOE.  HE IS AWESOME.  I guess that means we get to keep Rebecca too!  I have spoken w/ her and Fred.  She is excited about staying on the team BUT definitely wants a NEW opportunity.

Don't forget about Angel Cartagena, he is the Puerto Rico, Princeton graduate, Republican who is the chair of the DC Public Service Commission. If you need him you can get him. 

Let me know what else you need...I am here for YOU

Hi,
I'm a married 31 year-old Filipino immigrant based here in Baltimore and
works as a CPA in one of the big accounting firms in the country.  For more
than 12 years, I've seen how the Democratic Party exploits the minority
issue that sometimes I don't feel and I don't think of being a minority
anymore.  But putting the race issue aside, here's really want I want to
share with you, the LEFT is always painting the Golden Reagan years as the
"DECADE OF GREED".  Now, ALL Democratic Presidential hopefuls are USING THE
CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITION against George W.  Personally, I don't agree with
most of the President's economic stimulus, specially the tax breaks for
dividends which is I believe will only benefit the rich.  But anyway, going
back to the point I want to address, being fair and using my common sense to
understand the political and economic issues of our country, I think the
REAL DECADE OF GREED is the CLINTON YEARS, the decade where the STOCK MARKET
BUBBLE WAS CREATED and where ARTIFICIAL WEALTH CREATED MOSTLY BY THE
DOT.COMS RESULTED IN THE SHAMELESS UTILIZATION OF THE STOCK OPTIONS THAT
SUBSEQUENTLY AFFECTED MOST BIG COMPANIES THAT EVENTUALLY WENT BANKRUPT but
created few millionaires.  I am not surprised why the media is not reporting
on the way Joe Lieberman (God help us) and Al Gore stopped the Accounting
Standards Board in requiring Public Companies to expense stock-options
almost 10 years ago (refer to former SEC Chairman's Arthur Levitt's book
"take on the street: what wall street and corporate america don't want you
to know"). Lieberman (God Help Us) and Gore therefore got huge financial
support from the internet industry because of that.  So right now, I think
the economy is just right, there's nothing to fix, and there's nothing
George W. can do, except to just let it go, its free market, isn't it, and
right now it is just levelling, correcting the bubble created by the Clinton
years.  Hope that the Republican Party will have more common sense,
"modest", "ordinary and normal" Campaign Managers/Staff who are not in the
mold and tying to be like those Paul Begala-George Stephanopoulos or James
Carville-wannabees, since these campaign superstars (as they act like) of
the Clinton years are also part of the 'bubble' that was created during that
decade.  So, "It's not the Economy, Stupid, its the LEFT".

Thanks for your time reading this, and good luck.

respectfully,

Good morning, Gov. Bush: I am interested in what you see as the most important issues in higher education in Florida now and in the future.  In particular, what are your views on ways to increase the symbiosis between public higher ed and the local or state economy, will the university system continue to grow, and what is the status and future of the governance structure of Florida universities?  
 
I ask these not just because they are important nationally but also for the backdrop they would provide me as a candidate for the position of Vice President, USF and Campus Executive Officer of the St. Petersburg campus.  (I am one of 11 candidates invited to Tampa this week for an "airport interview".  The next phase will be on campus interviews for a much smaller number.)  As for background:  I was President of Knox College (a highly selective liberal arts college in Galesburg, IL), provost at Whittier College in Los Angeles, and was in public higher education for 20 years before that.  Presently, I am a mathematician at the National Science Foundation presently serving as a program officer.
 
Thanks in advance for considering these questions. All the best,
 
Richard Millman, Ph.D.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I was so delighted to find this website listing for you in this morning's Washington Post article on you and your family.
I would like to make a serious suggestion for the problem of disposing of those ballots with all the "hanging chads".  Although I am not sure of what politically correct problems might arise from this solution,
I sincerely wondered whether you and your state would ever consider the possibility of selling these ballots
as pieces of history to 
whomever would be interested in purchasing them.  I thought that perhaps this could be done as a fundraiser for either your schools down there or to aid the elderly poor in some manner.  It occurred to me that perhaps they might also be used to fund the purchase of new voting machines.  
     While I realize that this solution could create some problems
I also believe that if done correctly it could create good will as well--not to mention actually benefiting the constituents of your beloved state.  Perhaps for example the ballots could be turned over to individual schools who in turn could each develop their own method of disposal for
monetary remuneration.
You might even have each school challenge their individual students to come up with the most creative sales solution!  Advertise by
going national about it.
     I of course realize that you would have to be careful so as not to do anything to jepordize your brother's reelection campaign--and might even want to only do all of this after the next election.  
     In closing let me just
say that I applaud both 
you and your brother for
all that you are doing for
Florida and for the country in your respective jobs.  May God bless you both as well as all the members of your family.  
 
 With deep sincerity and
my prayers,

Dear Governor Bush:
 
Was just reading a newspaper article regarding your desire to discuss how the state can reduce drug use and your preference for using e-mail. I sure hope that includes alcohol dependency as well, if not, you and the state will be spinning your wheels as the two addictions are generally too related to separate--legalities aside.
 
As an ex-offender, a recovered alcoholic and addict and as an ex-counselor for what was the state's Tier Programs (~1986 operated Tier 4 at Clearwater Work Release for Operation PAR, Inc.) I believe I hold a Master's degree in what not to do. As what is written on paper may be far different than what is carried out--as I'm sure you well know. And, certainly, over the years I have observed and participated in offender recovery programs that do seem to work--certainly none as effective as "Sparky" yet in their more humane way--quite effective.
 
Also, as I am no longer working in any of these programs for the State of Florida or the Feds, I believe I have no conflict of interest with any program or modality and would be pleased to confidentially consult you and/or your staff pro bono (Frankly, since I went through life saving treatment instead of prison due to the wisdom of your courts -- I owe Florida bigtime) as to the harsh realities of stemming the tide of addiction and its negative externalities of crime, shattered families, corruption and the plight of the under and unemployed.
 
 
                                        Blessings to you and yours,
 
                                        Mark Servatius

Governor,

Just finished reading the WashPost article about you. Have to admit, I
didn't vote for you last election. My main reason: as a med student, with an
interest in pediatrics, I'm beginning to think the biggest effect we can
have on children's health occurs not in the doctor's office, but in the
early-childhood classroom. This is an interesting conundrum, because
children cannot learn nor develop properly unless their basic needs of
stability and health are met.  I believe in this strongly enough that it
supercedes the professional issue of tort reform, which I thank you for
considering.

Still, this article is fairly written, and portrays you as an honest man
with a conscience. While I do not agree with many of your policies, I am
impressed with your personal character. Kudos to your for your mature
dealings with the press.

Sincerely,
Patrick Tighe

>Sharon Pelletier: “Maine’s Army National Guard has a bone to pick with some of the state’s teachers and school officials.”
>Craig Colson: “Officers with the Guard’s Family Assistance Program say that some of the children of deploying soldiers are being traumatized by educators who have anti-war views.  [Alan] Grover explains.”
>Major Andrew Gibson: “… but I do know that it’s been coming from different communities and different school districts as we’ve moved through the state, ah  hearing that these kids have faced this.”
>Alan Grover: “What the kids are facing is hearing that their mother or father is a bad person for taking part in the confrontation with Iraq; comments that are coming from teachers.  That’s according to officers with the Guard’s Family Assistance Program who’ve been traveling throughout the state this week.  The officers report that such incidents are relatively few in number but that they’ve occurred in practically every region of the state.”
>Major Andrew Gibson: “Some kids have even reported that … ah … teachers have said things to them, specifically, about the  ah  unethical nature of their parent going off to fight.”
>LTC John Mosher: “Soldiers follow our instructions to coordinate with schools to let them know they will be leaving, that their child should be monitored and to keep an eye on >‘em.  And when we get responses back like it’s our problem that we’re deploying or that our child is a result of an unethical act in supporting the country, in supporting the president, as a soldier, it’s unacceptable.”
>Alan Grover: “Guard officials say that they are not suggesting that teachers should be censored but that point out that most of the Army kids who’ve been affected by the classroom criticism of the military are only 7 to 9 years old.  The Guard says tact in such cases is not too much to ask of Maine’s teachers.”
>Major Andrew Gibson: “The separation from a parent for any reason is traumatic, so it’s important for us to be sensitive to that …  and to realize that these kids need support now, not necessarily to be pawns in a debate.”
>Alan Grover: “Maine education commissioner Duke [Albanese] says he and the National Guard are discussing the allegations and he will issue an advisory to the state>’s educators if that’s warranted.

Gov. Jeb Bush,

Congratulations on the good work you have done and are doing in my
long-since-passed territory.
I am/was a graduate of Martin County High School in Stuart, Fl. My
boyhood home was in Salerno (now called Port Salerno). I enroled at Fla.
St. Univ. in the fall of 1947 in the first male class at what was, up
until that time, Fla. State College for Women. The 'new' Capitol was
built about the time I left there.
I have been many places in the intervening years and now live in Vienna,
VA. I am an actor and your sister-in-law, Margaret Bush is a good friend
of mine. Through her and the Little Theater of Alexandria I have met
your brother, Marvin and your mom who has attended a couple of our
plays. One of the things that I do for excitement, and money, is
impersonate our V.P., Dick Cheney. I did him last fall for our Sec.
Def., Don Rumsfeld and his Princeton class of '54 jocks who were
celebrating their 70th birthdays. What a night!!!! I also do George
Washington in full regalia.
Keep up the good work and save 'our' state for my many relatives who
still reside there. I expect to be visiting in April.
Most sincerely,
Al Pedersen, Jr.

I hope that you had a pleasant flight home. I enjoyed seeing you in the Ciudad Condal, although the weather was not representative of this magnificent Mediterranean city.

Thank you for your encouraging words to the Managing Director of CISCO Spain. On that note, I am working on establishing an international committee within Asimelec (the IT and Electronics Organization with over 2000 companies in Spain) to create bilateral trade ties between my alma mater (Florida) and Spain as Florida is the springboard into the US and Latin America. With some hard work, I am sure that the Miami Internet Alliance experience can be recreated between Spain and Florida. I will keep you informed.

I wish you courage and health to lead Florida through 2003!

Subject: St. Pete Times article-- Board Member: No FCAT for my kids


My response to the recent article in the St. Petersburg Times and new Board Member, Mary Russell's boycott of the FCAT:



Re: Board Member: No FCAT for my kids by Stephen Hegarty

School Board Member Mary Russell states, "But I disagree with the pressure.  I disagree with the funding.  It isn’t good for schools, and it isn’t good for kids."  

Well, I disagree with that assessment, that is, I agree with the FCAT.  I, along with the overwhelming majority of Florida parents, WILL send my children to school on March 3rd for FCAT testing.  

As a parent and a School Board Member, I support setting high expectations all of our children with the Sunshine State Standards.  I support holding school districts, schools and individual classrooms accountable for preparing our children to meet and exceed these standards.  How is that "not good for kids?"    

As a taxpayer, I support accountability. We spend over $1.2 billion tax dollars in Pinellas alone for public education.   If we fail to test our students, how will know if our money is well spent and more importantly, if our children are being well educated? As for the common concern about teaching to the test, if you are testing what you want the students to learn, then what’s the problem? 

Floridians overwhelmingly re-elected our Governor and the centerpiece of his first term—education reform.  Not only do I support his reforms, as an elected official, I have sworn to uphold the law.  The FCAT is mandatory under Florida law and  I will enthusiastically uphold this law.

I casually asked my third grade daughter what she thought about the upcoming FCAT.  She said nonchalantly that she really hadn’t thought about it too much, that it probably wouldn’t be any different from the practice tests.  She doesn’t sound "pressured" to me.  

Unfortunately, an increasing number of our students come to us with all types of challenges: disabilities, limited English, behavior problems, mental illness, homelessness to name but a few.  They each deserve our best efforts to give them a high quality education with high standards and accountability.

Dear Governor Bush:

The Philanthropy Roundtable has asked my group, Capital Research Center (CRC), for good examples of corporate philanthropy. We're at a bit of a loss. CRC studies the nonprofit sector, particulary advocacy groups, and we write critically about big corporations that make philanthropic grants to appease liberal activist groups. But we're looking for companies with positive community and/or faith-based giving programs. Any suggestions?

By the way, the president of CRC, Terry Scanlon, is a former Heritage Foundation vice president. So is the president of the Philanthropy Roundtable Adam Meyerson.

Subject: FYI - Juvenile justice

Got this today...will be attending the meeting tomorrow..on this subject...could be very interesting...

(Week of February 17-21)
Once again this was an active week for juvenile justice issues. The House Appropriations Public Safety Subcommittee met on Wednesday to take public testimony on the cuts to public safety programs recommended in the Governor's budget. The session was originally scheduled from 3:15-5:15 p.m. The session was extended until 7:30 p.m. and then again until 8:20 p.m. to allow all interested parties the opportunity to testify. 

Over 50 individuals representing sheriff's, police chiefs, school resource officers, business community, providers, Urban League, county commissioners, statewide associations, and national child welfare groups spoke against the proposed cuts to juvenile justice. Similar to the week before in the Senate, the most compelling testimony came from parents and young people who testified how CINS/FINS, PACE, and day treatment programs provided them a safety net and a means to turn their life around.  Rep. Gus Barriero (R-Miami Beach) summed up the mood late in the meeting. He expressed frustration that these cuts were even on the table for consideration.

On Thursday the Public Safety and Crime Prevention Committee met dedicating the entire session to juvenile justice. The Committee passed HB __ by Rep. Kravitz (R-Jacksonville), which clarifies that a school bus stop cannot be within a certain distance from the home of a registered sex offender. 

Next was a report on the Program Accountability Measures (PAM) report.  Ted Tollett pointed out where the methodology had been changed to accommodate that day treatment was no longer a commitment program.  Committee members asked questions why high scoring programs were closed and lower scoring programs were still operational.

John Fuller then reported the results of the Florida Corrections Commission review of intake and probation services at the Department of Juvenile Justice. He summarized the report and then presented the recommendations. There were a number of questions related to the exact number of probation officers needed to effectively supervise juvenile offenders.

Chairman Barriero then took public testimony regarding the proposed budget cuts to juvenile justice programs. Youth and law enforcement were given the opportunity to testify. The last item on the agenda was a discussion of the Governor's budget proposals related to the cuts recommended for juvenile justice.  Chairman Barriero asked Secretary Bankhead if he had recommended the cuts to the Governor in his legislative budget request.  Secretary Bankhead indicated they were not asked to submit cuts. The Committee then proceeded to question Brad Thomas, the Governor's public safety policy coordinator, on why the cuts were recommended and how CINS/FINS would be funded if moved to the Department of Children and Families with only half its present level of funding.  The dialogue was testy.  One member congratulated Mr. Thomas on his ability to dance around a direct answer. Chairman Barriero agreed to invite Mr. Thomas back to the next meeting to allow him time to make his full presentation.

The Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Criminal Justice met to discuss trust funds. The Senate Criminal Justice Committee heard a number of bills, none related to juvenile justice. Late Thursday Chairman Victor Crist (R-Temple Terrace) informed providers that he had submitted a budget that fully funded juvenile services including CINS/FINS, PACE and day treatment.  The budget submitted asked for $120 million more for public safety than was allocated in the Governor's budget.

Finally a series of meetings were held this week to promote a separate cost factor for juvenile justice education.  Both the Florida School Superintendents Association and the Florida School Boards Association agreed to support the concept of a separate cost factor for juvenile justice students.  Meetings were also held with seven legislators informing them of the proposal and encouraging them to support this initiative.

Importance:	High

Dear Governor Bush,

I want to thank you for your email. It was a great pleasure to have the chance to hold such an interesting meeting with you. I believe Spain, as a country, has a great opportunity to learn from one of the most culturally rich States in the U.S. The State of Florida combines the best aspects of both Latin and North American cultures, which is key to strengthening our current and future ties together. 
 
Please let me add that your visit was well received by everyone involved.  Each person you met was impressed by your pleasant and friendly manner, and felt that this will encourage the improvement and consolidation of a deep relationship between Spain and Florida at all levels. From my side, I will do everything in my power within Cisco and the American Chamber of Commerce in Spain to facilitate this goal.
 
Regarding the CEO/CIO Leadership Council in Florida next March, a formal invitation will follow shortly.  In the mean time, please find details at the following url  <http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/689/ceosummit/ceo02/> http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/689/ceosummit/ceo02/
 
Thanks again for taking the time to meet with me last week

Best regards,

What is wrong with saying that we did not choose suspension over nullification. All three governor's were purposely neutral. We will not file litigation to let our negotiations move forward. it is our intent that the federal court action will be delayed until after our negotiations are complete.

We should propose public dates for negotiation, propose our team including a new member or two and ask that Georgia do the same.

Subject: Reaction to Governors ACF Memo



Just hours after the three Governors signed their memo committing to renewed 
negotiation, lawyers from the US Dept. of Justice circulated a six page legal 
interpretation of what the Governors meant.  They are now seeking our approval 
to file it in federal court.

Their interpretation:

1) The Governors chose "suspension" over "nullification" of the pending 
controversial settlement agreement.  (I thought we were purposely neutral.)

2)  Commits Florida to not file any litigation.  (Florida is the only party in this 
entire affair to never file a lawsuit.)

3) Reserves the federal government's ability to litigate on these issues.

4) Potentially delays action by the federal court in Washington until after the 
Compact expires, while allowing Georgia to pursue a separate, related case in 
federal court in Georgia.

What is the rationale offered by the federal lawyers?

They want to be prepared to brief the federal judges on our progress.  The first 
scheduled status hearing is Thursday.

I propose we stick with our original intention which is to begin substantive 
negotiations, not more legal positioning.

By Thursday, we can share with the federal judge a copy of Florida's new water 
sharing proposal that picks up where we left off with negotiations last fall.  (We 
will provide it to Georgia and Alabama on Wednesday.)  This will do more to 
show progress than any "interpretation" of the Governors' agreement.

We could (and should) offer to return in two weeks and brief the judge on our 
negotiation progress.  This will help ensure timeliness and momentum.  We 
could provide such reports more routinely if desired.

The good news?

We do not have to engage in the process of negotiating what the Governors 
meant.  Our actions speak louder than words.

Florida is not filing suits or responding to legal maneuvering.  We will instead 
share ideas to fairly resolve the few remaining differences between the states.

May I assume you agree with this?  Please let me know.

Thanks,

David Struhs

Governor,

Good to hear from you!  After leaving the State Department I worked in Eastern Europe and Russia for a few years advising their governments on how to privatize state owned technology ventures.  Eventually the corruption became too difficult and I moved into management consulting after a brief stint running my own lobbying/political consulting firm in DC.  Though public policy is a passion, I just couldn't imagine spending the rest of my life as a political consultant.  It's too often about competition for those guys and not enough about trying to achieve some lasting result.

Since 1997 I've been with a management consulting firm focusing on e-commerce and e-government strategy.  I moved back to DC from Florida in 2000 and since last March I've been leading a large program for EPA to design and build a portal for receiving and exchanging environmental data.  That assignment will be ending soon though and I've begun thinking about what to do next.  My firm is a good one but I'm kind of running out of challenges.  

I'd love to move back to Florida but there are simply not enough opportunities.  Has your administration devoted much effort to getting more technology companies to relocate to the state?  Even in a tough tech market, Florida has a few strong assets.  For example, in the post-9/11 world, companies are spending huge sums to disperse their back office functions and create redundant operations.  Florida is a logical location due to the low cost of labor and real estate.  Moreover, the tourism infrastructure (frequent flights, inexpensive hotels) makes it an easy and cost-effective place to work remotely.  The state's development people should be calling on Fortune 500 companies (particularly New York-based financial services firms) with some good, targeted marketing collateral.  That's one tech target and there are certainly others.  

I didn't mention in my first email the other reason it gave me great pride to hear of your dad's parachute jump.  In 1983 I went into Grenada as an 18 year old machine gunner on the first plane carrying the 82nd Airborne.  It became obvious from the reception given us by the people that we'd done the right thing and we felt tremendous loyalty to President Reagan and your father for not having risked our lives without cause.  

All the best,
Lamont

It means a lot to us and when I say Us, I mean Us Americans.  Not just one person.  This email is being generated among thousands, if not Millions.  We are concerned.  this has hurt America as a country that was founded on Christian morals etc. and I voted for Both you and our president because of your morals, Please help.




After hearing that the state of Florida changed its opinion and let a Muslim woman have her picture on her driver's license with her face covered this is an editorial written by an American citizen, published in a Tampa newspaper. He did quite a job; didn't he? Read on, please! 

>IMMIGRANTS, NOT AMERICANS, MUST ADAPT. I am tired of this nation worrying about whether we are offending some individual or their culture. Since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, we have experienced a surge in patriotism by the majority of Americans. However, the dust from the attacks had barely settled when the "politically correct" crowd began complaining about the possibility that our patriotism was offending others. 

I am not against immigration, nor do I hold a grudge against anyone who is seeking a better life by coming to America. Our population is almost entirely made up of descendants of immigrants. However, there are a few things that those who have recently come to our country, and apparently some born here, need to understand. This idea of America being a multicultural community has served only to dilute our sovereignty and our national identity. As Americans, we have our own culture, our own society, our own language and our own lifestyle. This culture has been developed over centuries of struggles, trials, and victories by millions of men and women who have sought freedom. 

We speak ENGLISH, not Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, or any other language. Therefore, if you wish to become part of our society, learn the language! 

"In God We Trust" is our national motto. This is not some Christian, right wing, political slogan. We adopted this motto because Christian men and women, on Christian principles, founded this nation, and this is clearly documented. It is certainly appropriate to display it on the walls of our schools. If God offends you, then I suggest you consider another part of the world as your new home, because God is part of our culture. 

If Stars and Stripes offend you, or you don't like Uncle Sam, then you should seriously consider a move to another part of this planet. We are happy with our culture and have no desire to change, and we really don't care how you did things where you came from. This is OUR COUNTRY, our land, and our lifestyle. Our First Amendment gives every! citizen the right to express his opinion and we will allow you every opportunity to do so. But once you are done complaining, whining, and griping about our flag, our pledge, our national motto, or our way of life, I highly encourage you take advantage of one other great American freedom, THE RIGHT TO LEAVE. 

If you agree -- pass this along; if you don't agree -- delete it!

 Our responses have actually been fairly good. We only started to vaccinate in hospitals yesterday... Will go for 3 or 4 weeks. 

Every licensed FLA doc received direct mail from us. Hospitals select there own teams...maybe they did not want all the docs.

I'll investigate specifics and contact the citizen directly. We are not yet offering to primarily office based docs...only ER or other hospital based docs. Others will be offered as part of stage II.

The FL Times-Union reports today that smallpox shots are available to health care workers in the Jacksonville area.  However, my husband, a doctor, says he has received no notice via mail nor is there information in the doctor's lounge or posted at the hospital as to where, when  etc. these innoculations are available. 

Perhaps the poor response so far to taking the vaccine is due to a failure to inform the health care workers.

Dear Sir, 

I'm writing this email in regards to the Volusia County Health Department.  I'm sorry, but I wish to remain annomous, due to the fact that I'm in fear of losing my job.  I'm just curious if anyone has brought any issues to your attention regarding the hiring and firing process at VCHD.  As a white person, I feel there is alot of unfair reverse racial discrimination.  For example white employees are being fired or basically forced out the door and black people have been replacing those employees.  I'm not saying I'm racist and it doesn't matter to me who gets a job there, whether they are black, white, Spanish, Asian, etc.  I just want to make sure the person is qualified for the position.  There are many rumors floating around VCHD that the director is hiring people from his church, friends, and other black organizations.  Like I said, I don't have a problem who he hires, as long as he follows DOH rules/policies and they are qualified.  Again, I'm sorry for wishing to remain anounomous, but I'm sure you can see where I'm coming from.    Hopefully you will take this email seriously and investigate this matter further.  Please email me back if you have any questions or comments.

Governor:  The following is a chapter on a book I am writing called the United Brands of America, a look at states as brands.  I would love to hear your thoughts on both my book concept and my chapter on Florida.  Hopefully you remember meeting me last year while I was working for WFTV in Orlando.
 
John Damschroder
 
 
 
                                    Florida------The State of Formation
 
 
It is extraordinarily hard to criticize Florida on the subject of economic development.  The state is aggressive, professional and above all else, successful.  But, this success is in spite of, not because of, a well-developed brand strategy.  Where Florida has a growth strategy that it has published and follows successfully, the branding of the state would lead one to conclude state leaders have no idea what differentiates Florida from all other competitors.
 
Florida’s economic development brand claims status as the state of innovation.  While there are innovative economic stories to tell originating from Florida companies, universities or other institutions, Florida is not noted for the research done there or the patents owned by Florida institutions.  Florida clearly aspires to be innovative, as economically astute leaders understand that innovation is the key to high profit margins for business and a strong economy for them.  However, the single most distinctive feature of the Florida economy is rapid population growth.  Florida is The State of Formation, for new households, communities, businesses, schools, services, and infrastructure, ECT….
 
Florida averages 850 new additions to the state workforce each day.  Tourists seeking fun in the sun from around the world more than match this booming migration of workers and retirees.  The final result is heaven on earth for entrepreneurial citizens who see The State of Formation as a new business opportunity machine, constantly creating new customers, long on cash and short on established business relationships.  Moreover, Florida’s lack of income and inheritance taxes make business ownership more rewarding in The State of Formation than the same balance sheet would be in a state of stagnation or decline.  
 
Small business is the vital engine of Florida’s economy, 98% of the state’s employers have less than 100 workers.  But entrepreneurship is not the brand driving Florida; rather, new businesses are an organic part of the natural State of Formation.  This means Florida’s ability to attract retirees bringing with them the wealth of their lifetime, naturally creates opportunity for the builders and merchants who have come to Florida to serve them.  Florida’s ability to attract young families and keep their kids in the state is also at the heart of The State of Formation brand.
 
Florida’s branding strategy, economic development strategy and quality of life requirements, all centers upon keeping The State of Formation healthy, rather than allowing it to metastasize into a malignancy that kills prosperity.  Surely, Florida fears the power of branding itself in the strongest possible way, as The State of Formation; because the quality of life issues associated with this rapid growth is the chief political issue across the state.
 
Yes school children in Florida often attend classes in trailers.  Yes Florida roads are crowded with traffic and commute times and highway safety issues have suffered.  But The State of Formation brand can help answer this problem if state leaders will only trust the power they’ve created to solve the problems associated with growth.  The crisis in Florida classrooms can be solved by the formation of new private charter schools.  The crisis in transportation can be solved through the formation of a for profit light rail system throughout the state.  The State of Formation must use innovative thinking by government and economic development leaders to catalyze entrepreneurial solutions to the problems created by the fact that 7 of the top 20 job producing locations in the country are in Florida.  The strong Florida economy, built upon abundant opportunity for new business, is luring more population inflow, perpetuating the business growth opportunity, but adding to the quality of life stress.  The next step for Florida is to open the door to businesses built around the opportunity to solve these unique Florida problems.  Businesses that fit this brand building and protecting function should be given every advantage possible by the Florida economic development incentive program.  These are the businesses that should be at the very top of the Florida target list as these businesses, budding or established, are the solution to nearly all of the problems Floridians associate with rapid growth.
 
The State of Formation brand gives Florida a huge advantage of efficiency with their marketing because the story works for retirees, small businesses and the largest corporation alike.  People need to be where the action is.  Larger employers are suddenly drawn to The State of Formation because attracting a workforce is amazingly easy.  As the demographics of the nation continue to change in age and ethnic background, the savvy employers will go where the workers can be found in abundance rather than gambling that these workers can be easily attracted to a cheaper location.  Florida will be among the biggest benefactors of this powerful trend. 
 
 
The State of Formation must be careful to grow in an environmentally friendly way.  The natural beauty that combines with Florida’s sun kissed climate is the elemental component of the Florida growth story.  The formation of growth must realize the economic development drawing power of this natural beauty and protect this drawing card as essential to The State of Formation brand.  But given the fact that Florida’s beautiful environment is a key component in The State of Formation this should happen naturally.
 
Just as the United States remains the land of opportunity by making the problems that confront us into an opportunity for world changing solutions, so to can The State of Formation protect its special place in America by always reverting to formation as the solution.  Florida is being touted as the new California, meaning the new home of trends that sweep the nation.  This is solid evidence that Florida is utilizing a formation strategy to solve problems and maintain growth.  This natural occurrence would be strengthened immeasurably by a state brand that recognized the unique aspect of Florida’s allure.

Subject:	Item 23

Dear Commissioner Thaell,

We have known each other for a long time and are possibly on different sides
of the aisle politically and philosophically but we do share a love for our
community and country.  The item you have before the commission tonight has
received enough negative publicity that any positive you would hope to gain
from it seems to be no longer possible.

Regardless of your wording, it appears to put you in concert with people
around the world who would make our country and our President the culprit in
this world crisis.  Whether or not this is the signal you send, it is the
one being received and not fairing well among many local residents.  As it
was reported in Saturday's Democrat the resolution appeals to our sense of
economy rather than our sense of justice.  It simply cannot come out right
with those of the community who are strong supporters of our President and
our military.

Added to this is the impression that the Leon County Commission should not
be engaged in such debate but should keep more pressing local matters on the
agenda.  Potential loss of revenue due to international action is a dubious
concern at best.  Please consider withdrawing or tabling the resolution, it
is an untimely and needless stirring of the pot.

Dear Elected Officials of Polk County and friends,

 

On February 7, 2003, Senator Debbie Wasserman Schultz from the Miami-Dade District filed the Senate Bill S1022 - Statewide Impact Fee. I will include the context of the Bill at the end of this letter.


This Bill will create Florida Statute 201.032, which imposes a statewide impact fee on all real estate transactions, with an amount to be determined by the legislature, and fees collected would be given to school districts for new construction needs. All currently collected fees by counties for this purpose would be repealed by this new law that would take effect as of July 1, 2003.

 

I have written the newspapers of Polk County, and their “Letter to the Editor” sections, and as of today there has been NO mention of this Bill anywhere. It is as if certain folks in Polk County want to keep silent any mention of this Bill publicly for fear of damaging their own tax increase initiatives. I am today writing and making my second attempt to newspapers and elected officials to acknowledge this Bill publicly. 

 

I find it rather ironic that the Senator who filed this Bill is from the very troubled Miami-Dade School District that has spent 6 billion dollars of tax money on new school construction, and is still in deep trouble. As reported in the Miami Herald in a series of articles outlining the school district’s wasteful spending, poor planning, shoddy construction, incompetence, and a total lack of accountability of the school district that has allowed what amounts to possible misconduct to continue for the past 15 years.

 

I have pleaded with the school board for sometime now about creating a method of accountability to the citizens of Polk County, published and presented to the citizens on a yearly basis BEFORE forging ahead with any tax initiative. I also had included as part of my campaign package for district 3 the same message that I would work to establish this system, but my campaign to get this accountability system has had little success. It is as if the political leaders and elected officials do NOT want any such system in place!

And it is for a lack of any system of accountability to the citizens of Polk County that I have stated that the voters will NOT approve any self imposed tax referendum to increase school construction funding.

 

I strongly urge all of you to reconsider what I have said before forging ahead with any further strategy of the ½ cent sales tax or impact fee.

Otherwise, I believe all of your efforts and dollars spent on this initiative will be in vain. I am not convinced of this school boards’ sincere desire to do what is right with the citizens’ taxes, and I am not alone in that belief. All one has to do is look at the past spending habits of this school district to find much the same things that caused the Miami-Dade School District to be in such a mess today. This, I would hope, is something the Polk County School Board wants to NOT be a party of here in our school district…yet they have shown NO initiative towards any accountability system. One has to wonder why?

 Posted on Sun, Feb. 23, 2003 

CARL HIAASEN, the Miami Herald

Putting students in harm's way is criminal 

The train wreck otherwise known as the Miami-Dade County school district can't possibly be salvaged by a state oversight board acting alone. A battalion of prosecutors is also needed. 


As documented in a recent Herald series, the school district has blown millions upon millions of dollars on shoddy construction, laughably inexperienced architects and highly dubious cost adjustments. 


The waste on school projects is so routine and institutionalized that random incompetence must be ruled out. It's impossible to believe that any group of bureaucrats -- even in South Florida -- could be so collectively and consistently derelict over the course of 15 years. 


Despite appearances to the contrary, the Miami-Dade school administration wasn't just a bunch of halfwits running amok. It was a criminal enterprise that needed to be attacked as such. 


All that wasted money didn't just evaporate. It went into a multitude of pockets, and finding out whose pockets shouldn't be too difficult. 


What could be more important than tracking down, prosecuting and locking up those responsible for victimizing thousands of kids? 


And that's the real crime here. While taxpayers are being serially ripped off, it's the children who are paying the highest price for the school district's misconduct. They're the ones being crammed into overcrowded classrooms inside crumbling firetraps. 


In 1988, Miami-Dade voters approved a $980 million bond issue for building schools to keep up with the county's bloating population. A high school economics class could have handled the windfall more responsibly than the school district. 


Most schools that got built were completed long after they were supposed to be done, and they were packed well beyond capacity on opening day. The average delay on projects was more than two years, and 30 projects sat idle for more than five years. As the kids stewed in portables, the costs spiraled upward. 


According to The Herald's analysis, 39 of 44 new schools surpassed their construction budgets by a total of $117 million -- or enough to build 10 new elementary schools. 


Who screwed up? You name it -- architects, engineers, builders. Even when competent work was being done, district staffers were allowed to make costly last-minute changes. 


Getting to the gnarly root of the scandal would be frustrating, but not impossible. All it would take is a couple of sharp federal prosecutors and, say, a half-dozen FBI agents. 


The most logical place to begin is the School Board, which has unfathomably awarded more than $228 million in repeat business to 21 contractors who've been late with previous projects, failed to finish them entirely or did half-ass jobs on those they did finish. 


Gosh, do you think any of those contractors had personal or political connections to certain School Board members? 


One intriguing case involves Roma Construction, which in 1990 was hired to build Marjory Stoneman Douglas Elementary. The school ended up 390 days late in construction, and Roma withdrew before the work was done. 


Yet four years later, the board gave Roma a $14.6 million contract to build Paul Bell Middle School. Afterward, the district successfully filed for damages, claiming Roma had put in the wrong walls and cafeteria floor, screwed up the electrical system and failed to finish the concrete. 


Imagine that. 


Left on its own, the School Board undoubtedly would give Roma an even-bigger contract the next time around. That's why Gov. Jeb Bush and legislators have intervened, forcing the district to cooperate with a state oversight board. 


Parents are at their wit's end. Teachers are pulling their hair out. Principals are pleading for help. 


So much money has been squandered on construction fiascoes that more than 44,000 fire and safety hazards in hundreds of schools remain uncorrected. 


Miami Senior High has 486 outstanding violations all by itself. If it was a burger joint it would have been shut down as a public menace. 


That the School Board has been willing to leave thousands of children in harm's way, despite repeated warnings from fire marshals, is nothing short of criminal. 


Consider this: Adding together local bond funds, state construction dollars and property tax revenues, the Miami-Dade school district has taken in nearly $6 billion to build and maintain schools over the last 15 years. 


Six billion dollars -- and they can't afford a $50 smoke detector. 


State oversight is the least you should expect, since it's obvious that the School Board can't be trusted with a nickel. It's even more obvious that big-league skimming has been going on, and that some people in high places belong in prison. Where the fire sprinklers probably work just fine.

Dear Governor Bush: 

My wife and I are exploring the opportunity of moving to Florida to be closer to our parents who are retired or soon will be retired in your state.  I am writing to seek your assistance and suggestions of who on your staff or within the Florida GOP I should speak to about political and government employment in your state.

I have spent seven years on Capitol Hill, the last six working for Congressman Jerry Weller, where I currently serve as Deputy Chief of Staff and Communications Director.

A good Republican, I volunteered on your father's 1992 reelection campaign in Delaware while I was in college, and helped work phone banks for your brother's 2000 campaign in Illinois.

Traveling with Congressman Weller over the 2002 election cycle I had the chance to campaign for Ginny Brown Waite, Katherine Harris, Tom Feeney and Ric Keller last year.

I also spent a year at law school in your state at the Stetson University Law Center. 

I look forward to joining the Bush/FL GOP Team and appreciate any suggestions you might be able to lend in finding employment in state government, politics or government relations in your state.

Thanks,

EFI Board: 

I want to share with you the results of an image perception study we conducted last fall as part of the Team Florida Marketing Campaign.  The study had three objectives:  to help us understand how Florida is perceived as a business destination; to provide strategic direction for the marketing campaign; and to establish a baseline and target goal to measure the campaign's success.  We presented this information to the Partner and TEC Leadership Councils in January, and our vice chair, Bill Habermeyer, requested that when the study was complete it be shared with you.  I've attached a PowerPoint that summarizes the study for your review.  

The study surveyed more than 1,000 CEOs, CFOs and other executives in companies with more than 50 employees in our key targeted industries -- biomedical technology, information technology, manufacturing, aviation/aerospace/defense, and high-end professional services, such as banking and insurance.  The 10-minute telephone survey asked respondents a host of questions in an effort to gauge their perceptions of Florida as a business destination.

Highlights include: 

25% have positive perceptions of Florida as a business destination -- we want to reinforce these perceptions 
41% of respondents have no business image of Florida -- we want to introduce them to Florida 
15% have mixed views of Florida -- we want to persuade them 
19% have negative perceptions -- a challenge 

When asked to rate specific business characteristics, Florida's quality of life and international business capabilities received high marks; respondents perceived the quality of Florida's workforce and education system less favorably. 

Interestingly, 54% of executives with operations in the state were unable to come up with an answer to this question: 

"If a colleague was looking to expand their business and they asked you to tell them about Florida's business climate, what would you say?"

Clearly, we have a challenge within our own state and with our business colleagues.  We're looking at ramping up in-state marketing efforts -- if the Team Florida Marketing Campaign receives funding -- but I'd appreciate it if each of you will actively look for opportunities in your daily routine to deliver the message that Florida is a great place to do business.

Please let me know if you have any additional questions or comments on the survey.

Sheriff Balks On Takeover Of DCF Role

By SHERRI ACKERMAN
sackerman@tampatrib.com
Published: Feb 25, 2003

TAMPA - The Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office could begin the onerous
task of taking over child protection investigations from the state April
1. That's more than a month behind the anticipated start of Feb. 15,
although state leaders said Monday it won't derail plans to complete the
switch by July 2004.
Still, Sheriff Cal Henderson said there is no ``done deal'' until he's
satisfied by the state's financial commitment.
Henderson has resisted taking over the investigations from the
Department of Children and Families, mainly because he knows DCF has
battled a lack of money and investigative staff for years.

=============================================================
COMMENT: When you try doing something like getting a handle on DCF and
you fail so miserably what happens then?  Well if you're Gov. Jeb Bush
you pass the buck and set-up someone else to fail instead!
If any Florida County Commissioner lets Gov. Bush get away with this,
his latest "devious" plan, every BOCC member in the State should resign
in disgrace.

Governor Bush:

First, please accept my very belated congratulations on your
re-election.  As you can imagine I was pleased, but never in doubt as to
the outcome!  We all look forward to the continuing four years and
beyond.  

You've been so responsive and helpful to me in the past; I wonder if I
may come to you for guidance once again.  The communication below
broadly describes an escalating event that we believe offers significant
economic harm to Florida business, specific to international trade.
Melissa Freedman has worked very hard to develop a dialog with U.S.
Customs; however, the solution they have extended to her is, in our
opinion, not a solution at all, and, once deployed, irreversible; the
damage to business irreparable.  We have also attempted to reach Dr.
Dana but understand her office does not work with these issues.
Perhaps we do not understand the proper avenue of communication...

Can you please describe to me the most effective and concise method to
use to earn your attention on this issue, so that you can then review
and determine if it is meritorious enough to earn the resources of your
staff?

We are a constituent company with offices in Miami and Tampa; our client
base is global, with nomenclature including thousands private and public
entities.  I am happy to provide whatever information may be of use in
determining the merits of our case.

Your comments and questions are encouraged; thank you in advance for
your consideration.

24-Hour Rule and Manifest Confidentiality

		Hello Melissa:

		Thank you for your time this afternoon and especially
for your willingness to expedite this matter for us.  The attached link
to the Federal Register identifies the deadline for public comment as
Monday, February 10, 2002.  As a constituent business with offices in
Tampa and Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, we request advocacy from your office:
specifically, submission of a letter in response to the Federal Register
notice for public comment.  A sample or template of suggested copy is
attached for your review and consideration.

		Here are the most critical discussion points:

		Economic Harm to Florida Business:    In addition to
severely restricting the marketing, economic development, competitive
intelligence and strategic planning activities of Florida business
engaged in international trade, the proposed ruling will restrict the
decisioning tools of foreign companies who use this data to identify
potential Florida business counterparts, or key traffic areas for site
selection and plant expansion.  

		Business interests include but are not limited to
manufacturers  (chemical, equipment, hardware, textile, etc.),
pharmaceutical companies, NVOCCs, banks, railroads, freight forwarders,
custom house brokers, trade development agencies, importers and
exporters, and law firms; example:  the Florida Ports Council uses this
data in developing and implementing economic and business development
initiatives vital to the growth of international commerce in Florida.  

		Duplication of an Effective, Existing Law:  The proposed
ruling duplicates the Trade Act of 1930 that contains an automatic
system for protecting the confidentiality of the identities of importers
and consignees.  See 19 C.F.R. § 103.31(d)(1); 19 U.S.C. §
1431(c)(1)(A).  It also contains a procedure to bar publication of
manifest data about a particular cargo shipment whenever the Secretary
of the Treasury determines that publication may harm national security,
or may cause personal injury or property damage.  These well-established
procedures strike the balance between preserving national security,
facilitating public disclosure of manifest information, and enabling
parties interested in doing so to protect their confidentiality.
		The current rule for biennial confidentiality
certifications works well, with more than 1,200 exporters and 1,700
importers making use of the biennial confidentiality certification
procedure.  During the 22 years that the current rule has been in
effect, the confidentiality provisions have generated very few
complaints from those that file confidentiality certifications, and
PIERS is frequently in contact with Customs' Disclosure Law Branch to
ensure that shipper confidentiality is maintained.
		Undermining of Congressional Policy; No Credible
Contribution to Port Security:  This proposal originated in response to
comments filed in the rulemaking proceedings for the "24 hour rule" - an
initiative designed to increase port and maritime security.  Yet,
reducing the amount of vessel cargo information released will not
increase security.  It will, however, seriously harm trade and law
enforcement activities that rely extensively upon the availability of
this information through PIERS and other information services. 

		Florida clients who have submitted letters of support
for our position include the Greater Tampa Chamber of Commerce and the
Florida Ports Council.

		Your comments and questions are encouraged.  For
additional information or clarification:

Agency for WorkForce Innovation
The Caldwell Bldg., #150
107 E. Madison Street
Tallahassee, Florida 32399

Re: 	Failure to carry out Governor's policy that welfare recipients
become 
	self-sufficient

Dear Ms.  Raymaker:

	The State of Florida is in non-compliance with federal regulations
codified at 7 C.F.R. Sections 222 and 223, and its own Food Stamp and
Employment and Training Program (FSET) . The state agencies' continual
failure to carry out their duties under these laws has resulted in promoting
the welfare cycle. Denying participants the  training, education and support
services they so sorely need to become self-sufficient not only violates
federal and state laws but the spirit behind their enforcement. 

The purpose of the Food Stamp Employment and Training Program is to ensure
the poor reach authentic self-sufficiency .  Self-sufficiency does not mean
requiring the welfare recipients to take  low-paying jobs when they are
uneducated and lack the very resources they need to seek employment which
leads to authentic self-sufficiency.   This failure by the state agencies
to carry out their obligations under the federal and state laws  is causing
a bureaucratic nightmare and continues the degrading cycle of welfare for
the very families these laws are intended to help.

 Governor Jeb Bush has repeatedly stated  that welfare recipients must be
provided services to reach the goal of self-sufficiency.  The general
failure of program administrators  to ensure their case workers follow the
purpose, policies and procedures is a statewide problem. The state need only
compare the number of actual cases with the number of authentic assessments,
the number of sanctions  imposed by the food stamp program and the agencies
operating under the authority of AWI in Tallahassee, the reason for the
sanctions and the attempts to conciliate prior to imposing sanctions. 

 

I.   FAILURE TO ASSESS REGISTRANTS

 Florida's Food Stamp Employment and Training Program and Workforce One
programs are designed to provide registrants with the education, training
and support services  necessary to become authentically self-sufficient
through employment. FSET and Workforce One agency staff are required to
perform an employment assessment on participants. Training activities are
mandatory in all 37 counties.  Registrants who have been assessed as needing
training will be directed into a training activity .  Priority service will
be provided to able-bodied adults without dependents. The problem is that
these required assessments are not being conducted.  

In Broward County assessments are not being performed on food stamp
registrants. It is easier for case workers not to conduct an assessment and
send the registrant on a job search when, in fact, there is a need for
training. From speaking to other advocates statewide, assessments are
non-existent.

 As a former social worker and welfare mother, I do not understand how case
workers can effectively help a person applying or receiving  food stamps or
welfare to become authentically self-sufficient without conducting an
assessment. Conducting  a proper assessment would very likely obviate the
need to push the "sanction button" since an assessment would require the
caseworker to get to know the registrant and identify any problem areas such
as no money for transportation to make required appointments. Currently,
there is no follow-up being undertaken, only the pushing of the "sanction
button". 


II.	ILLEGAL SANCTIONING

Pursuant to Federal Regulation, 7 C.F.R. 273.22 and Part VI of the Food
Stamp  Employment and Training, a registrant must not be sanctioned unless
it is determined that the registrant fails or refuses to participate with
program requirements. As soon as there is a failure to comply with a program
requirement, the FSET or Workforce One case worker must begin the
conciliation process. According to this process, the case worker must make
every effort to resolve the dispute.  Generally, this is not how the
agencies statewide are conducting business.  

In Broward County,  if a registrant fails to attend an appointment, there is
no follow-up. A sanction is immediately imposed.  It becomes easier for the
case workers to immediately direct that  a sanction be imposed than it is
for them make a follow-up call.to determine if good cause exists for
non-compliance. Good cause for not complying with a program requirement is
defined at 7 C.F.R.Section 273.22, yet case workers do not attempt to
inquire about whether good cause exists or not. As you can see from the
attachment, the FSET agency here in Broward County has decided  to remove
"good cause"  as a reason for a participant's  failure to comply. There is
no authority to remove good cause from the federal and state laws. 

III.	EXEMPTIONS

An individual is exempt from complying with program requirements if he or
she provides a statement from a physician, nurse, nurse practitioner,
designated representative of the physician's office.. 7 C.F.R.273.24  AWI
and FSET have decided that only a statement from the physician is
acceptable.  Therefore, if a participant brings in a statement from anyone
other than the physician that he or she is unable to work, the participant
is then sanctioned for not complying. Federal Regulations are to be
followed; not just a portion of the law.  I was told by the Director of FSET
and  the attorney for AWI in Tallahassee that only a physician's note would
be acceptable.  In many cases, a nurse practitioner is available to provide
the statement. It is very difficult for registrants to get a note from
physicians.  To require registrants to demand the physician sign the
statement is setting them up for failure and the sanction which follows.  

 There is a definite lack of proper training of staff about the requirements
under federal and state law. For the past 20 years I have been representing
the poor, I have discovered that the attitude  of many  of the agencies'
staff is to keep services away from the very people who need them. I have a
keen interest in helping welfare mothers and the poor in general to become
authentically self-sufficient.  Shoving heads of households into low paying
jobs at places like Burger King, McDonalds, maid agencies, will not satisfy
the purpose stated by the Governor that the poor must become
self-sufficient.  It only results in a revolving door for the poor who then
end up homeless, in prison, or on drugs, and leads their children into
foster care.

This is not a political issue. The law is there to be followed.  The
education, training and support services exist. What needs to change is the
way state employees are doing their jobs. Refusal to perform proper
assessments, the endless pushing of the sanction buttons without determining
the causes for non-compliance creates more work for all of us. Thus, the
taxpayers suffer along with society.  There is more bang for the buck when
assessments are performed and the revolving door shuts. 

I am available to assist in working out the above issues. I believe that
working together we can make a better Florida for all of us. I anxiously
await your response.  

Sincerely,

I have reviewed Rep. Farkas' proposed CON bill. Among some other things,
it does the following things:

1. It expressly prohibits the licensure of any hospital that is owned in
part or in whole by a physician (the purpose is to prohibit "boutique
hospitals").

2. It permits elective and emergency percutaneous coronary intervention
programs in hospitals that do not have open heart surgery programs as
long as the programs meet certain objective criteria and submit quality
outcome standards data to AHCA to ensure the program is operating
safely; if not, the hospital's license is subject to revocation.

3. It eliminates CON review for cardiac cath, elective and emergency
percutaneous coronary intervention programs, and adult OHS programs, AS
LONG AS those services are provided only in general acute care hospitals
or specialty children's hospitals (obviously prohibiting those services
from being performed in "boutique hospitals).

Rep. Farkas has requested that we submit comments to his staff ASAP on
the bill. Please let me know how we should proceed and what type of
comments we should submit to Rep. Farkas' staff.

Dear Gov Bush,

Today at our school's faculty meeting, our well-meaning principal
said something that really irked all teachers to no end.

I wonder if you could somehow publicly clarify it.

My principal said that although he had not read this anywhere else, the
school board member in Tampa, who is keeping her child home for FCAT
out of protest, publicly claimed that "4" is now the required passing grade
on FCAT writing exams.

I politely said to him, "That does not sound right to me." [The scoring
is 1-5, with 1 being the lowest -- so how could "4" now be "passing"?]

Every teacher in the room groaned upon hearing the principal say that.

Could you or someone clarify this for everyone, since these tests are coming
up?

Thanks,
Susan Alyn
FL teacher

Thank God Angie continues to grow and do well.  Angie is 2 1/2 years going on 5. The reason for my email is because I would like to inform you that recently  iparenting.com did a story on Angeline and Spina Bifida. I told the reporter how helpful you had been when we needed your help.

While I lobbied for the State Attorney's Office in Tallahassee and Washington I would always ask David to review proposed legislation for accuracy and reasonableness.  
 
Jeb, it would be a high honor to have David on the 7th Circuit Court and I know you would always be proud of the job he would do.  I know his name has been before you several times as a candidate for appointment which should be a strong indication of the job the nominating committee thinks he will do.

Dear Governor Bush,

The students at Crown Point Elementary School in Jacksonville have been working very hard on the FCATexplorer web site at school.  Some students work on the web site at home.  Students that do not have a computer at home have been going to the public library.

The problem some of them are having at the public library is due to the fact that the Internet Explorer Browser needs to be upgraded to at least version 5.  This upgrade is free so I don’t understand why the libraries would hesitate to do so.

I don’t know if other counties are having the same problem but if you could let the public library system be aware of this problem it would be very helpful to our students.

Dear Gov. Bush,
      We just received word that Florida has established a Department of
Non-Public and Home Education; further learning that the person who's
been chosen to head it is a PUBLIC School System Leader.
      Strikes me as totally either a slap in the face at Non-Public and
Home Education, or a really, really stupid move on the part of the state.
 Public Education people are so involved in the bureaucracy that nurtures
them, that Home Education and Non-public Education have been a threat to
them for years...this is tanamount to giving the fox charge of the
chickens..
       Non-Public, and Home Education, have traditionally exemplified the
BEST of the Educational process because their focus has been on teaching
the student not only the essentials, (Reading, Writing, and Arithmetic),
but the skills with which to realistically apply them in the day to day
business of living -and earning a living within our society.
       The Public Education process has been a dismal failure on several
fronts because they have lost sight of teaching the student anything more
than how to pass tests. The foremost enterprises, within the Public
Education real, have been: 
                     1.Babysitting -keeping the children in some
semblance of order and somewhere while the parents work.
                     2.Fund Raising -by establishing criteria and tests
with which to guage their levels of performance in order to qualify for
either State or Federal Funds.
                     3.Career Enhancement -jockeying for the various
leadership positions within the structure of the Bureaucratic
establishment, and/or attempting to maintain those positions they do
have.  
       The Department of Non-Public and Home Education should be lead by
an individual who fully understands and appreciates these Educational
endeavors; a person from within this environment.  
        We write, not only in protest over the current choice of
leadership, Dr. Alex Penn Williams, but in effort to encourage our great
State back to reality.  Thank you for your time and attention to our
letter.

Subject: Re: PS Fw: FCAT - Is this true? 


Well, I believe you, Governor Bush!


But, I am also telling you the truth - so, like I suggested, I think that
whoever it is up in Tallahassee that writes memos to all superintendents,
for all principals, for all teachers, should: write a memo, explaining
what these FCAT scores mean.

For example, after the principal said that (and, he did say he had NOT read
that anywhere else), one teacher asked:

"Now, if that board member keeps her child home from FCAT, does that
student still pass the grade -- without the FCAT?"

I think the principal said: "Well, not if the kid is in 3rd - that kid has
to take the test."

So, I am just saying, it would be good to have information that calms people
down. A review of the possible scores, what these scores mean in terms of
"passing or failing" and what a student has to do to pass the grade level.

And, what it means if students do not show up for the test.

I only say this beause I know these teachers are working very hard at
preparing students, and the principal began by noting that, and thanking
them.

There is tutoring after school, two extra teachers hired in my school to
help bring up scores, etc., and this is an A/B school already.

But, if teacher get misinformation, with all the stress some of them already
feel, well, that is enough to put some of these teachers over the edge.

This, above,  is just my opinion, but I trust you know I am only trying to
help you and the teachers.

Gov Bush,

I did a google search for that article about the school board member
keeping her child home in protest of FCAT, because I had seen heard of
that
article and seen it too
(but couldn't recall anything about a "4 " as a passing grade); however,
I couldn't find it to show you. But, this article does exist somewhere.
Maybe it's even on FR somewhere.

I  hope that before this FCAT, maybe someone could set my principal
straight
on that matter, as I don't want to do that.

And, I know teachers talk, and these teachers will tell other teachers,
etc.
and then this "myth" gets started and passed around.

Maybe someone from the state could simply "review" what the grades mean
on
FCAT before that test is given, so people calm down a little and
don't flip out over this kind of misinformation that we heard today at
this
faculty meeting.

And, again, I think my principal was not trying to upset anyone.

So, maybe some type of
public clarification re FCAT scoring and grades
would be useful for all teachers as well as parents.

Susan

Governor:

Hope you had a successful trip.  I'm working on a draft of ideas to present to the Oversight Board, in some cases based upon thoughts I expressed to you a couple of months ago.  Would appreciate your feedback on what is of interest and what is not.  For example, what of a state school construction authority, to take over construction responsibilities and capital funds from districts?  What of splitting MDCPS into three or four districts, and creating new structure and systems for school operations?  If we do not create a construction authoirity, what of imposing outside checks and balances, i.e. state inspectors and auditors, into all district construction projects? Regards,

Paul

Gov. Bush,

Here, below,  is an example of a memo that got to all teachers, about
a matter originating from the state.

And, in addition to this kind of memo to all teachers, some kind of press
release for the parents  to see in the newspapers would be very useful.

I honestly think this would go a long way in helping people to relax and
just not worry about it, and not latch onto misinformation, whether it comes
from misinformed board member/parents, principals, or teachers.

It's better if this info -- the CORRECT info -- comes from you, or someone
up there, and gets out now, before the test.

Subject: Technology for Schools $ Poor Communities


  

Dear Governor,

We communicated about a year and a half back. I wanted to send you this information so that the state of Florida does not miss its last chance to participate in a technology partnership program that can deliver roughly $45,000,000 in net benevolence to education facilities throughout the state. 

My organization, Angels Helping Hand Foundation (AHHFC), a 501C3 charity, has proposed to build a technology capture and refurbishment program to support the K-12 public education system and the Digital Divide effort.  The focus would be to assist school districts to replace obsolete tools, to provide poor communities struggling to obtain technology with an affordable method to acquire quality computers, to build a refurbishment center where technology can be donated by corporations and retooled to assist school districts/charities lacking the warehouse resource or the technical wherewithal and to deliver a process that will empower the state to receive tens of millions of dollars in added value via the creation of efficiency in the procurement of technology. 

The technology we deliver will have a minimum benefit of assisting school districts or digital divide programs to avoid an additional $150 and in many cases up to $400 per unit in computer expense. We propose to deliver over 170,000 computers during the next ten years. The share of the expense we are requesting from the state to build this technology coalition and program is $150,000 annually for a 5 year time period. The state of Florida’s funding will represent roughly 5% to 10% of the total expense. Private resources and a self-support process will cover the rest. 

There are many reasons why Florida needs a program like this. The refreshment of technology in schools, more tools for poor districts and affordable computers or a more equitable education for underprivileged communities are just a few. The lack of technology is also a bottleneck preventing content and training efforts from reaching their desired recipients. Unfortunately, these are the reasons why other states as well as non-public education entities need and want this effort. My board has ordered me to dissolve any relations with all Florida government entities should our proposal not be considered after this fiscal year. We have tried unsuccessfully twice before to build this effort on the state’s behalf and the general feeling is that it is time to fish or cut bait. 

I realize the state is facing massive financial deficits, but a solution doesn’t often occur that can fix a problem while saving money. The proposed technology delivery schedule even in the first year of publicly supported service will provide a benefit to education facilities exceeding state expense.  I have attached information that explains things in greater detail. My organization has met and explained this effort and the proposal to Secretary Horne, Ruben Lopez, Larry Wood, Kim Bahrami, and Jon Conley of your office for Education Policy and Budget. We have also put a Member Budget Request (CBIR) into the system via Senator Wise and Representative Hogan under funds for the Learning Equipment Acquisition Partnership (LEAP) program. This is a statewide initiative that is viewed positively and would be used by school districts across Florida. Everyone, I believe, thinks this effort has merit. 

In closing, I wish I didn’t have to ask for any funding but my board feels that if we are to facilitate a solution and benefit, that the receiving entity must financially participate and have a small stake in this effort. With all of the other things going on I hope the “powers to be” can remember to approve this small funding request. I would not look forward to transferring tens of thousands of corporate technology out of and away from the schools of my native state.  

Sincerely,

Daniel A. Bolton, Executive Director

Subject: Idea for Teacher Shortage


Dear Governor Bush:
 
I have recently drafted legislation which I am introducing through my district's senator to provide some relief for the looming teacher shortage.  If you would consider supporting it, I would be grateful.
 
Under Fla. Stat. 1012.99, Florida is party to an interstate agreement whereby states which accept Florida teachers' certification will have their teachers' certification accepted in Florida.    The Commissioner of Education--with the approval of the State Board of Education--is authorized to extend such reciprocity to other states.  Currently, reciprocity exists with 38 states.
 
My idea would authorize and direct the Commissioner of Education to extend reciprocity to all states regardless of whether they extend reciprocity to Florida.  Of course, if the Commissioner and the State Board of Education found that a particular state did not have sufficient certification standards, reciprocity could be withheld.  
 
Although it may initially seem overly generous to accept teachers from states that don't accept Florida teachers, this really works to our advantage:  teachers who desire to move to Florida or who are moving into Florida with their families will be able to teach in Florida schools.  Florida teachers, however, will be inclined to stay put.  Hence, our schools will have a larger pool from which to draw public school teachers.
 
As you are aware, the Class Size Initiative, the No Child Left Behind statute, and the usual economics are making hiring and retaining teachers increasingly difficult.  While this plan will not solve all of the problem, for every teacher it does make employable in Florida, twenty-five or so students will be served.  For this reason, on behalf of my client, the District School Board of Monroe County, I ask for your consideration.
 
Very truly yours,

Dear Jeb, this is probably the ONLY way I could ever communicate with the
Governor of Florida.  Without having read the Washington Post  article about
you I would never have known how to reach you.  Thank you for the
opportunity to e-mail you.
I am a 53 year old dad of two young men who have at various times brought
many tears so I empathize with you with your daughter.  God bless her in her
struggle and bless you and your wife.  Thank GOD you have the family and
resources that you do.
My wife and I have voted "straight Bush" and love your entire family.  Wish
we could hug y'all just to show our love but our votes are the best we can
do.

My wife worked 30 years for BellSouth and worked her way up from a part time
operator to one of the top 1 1/2 % in achievement before she was ganged up
on be a couple of her co-workers who for some reason had a grudge against
her.  They inflicted such stress and emotional turmoil on her that she
finally broke down physically and emotionally.  She had managed rheumatoid
arthritis for 20 plus years but after what happened to her it flared out of
control into chronic pain,,,chronic depression to the point that now she
only goes out of the house for doctor appointments.  I reiterate:  She was
the toughest of the tough.  One of the three brightest people I have ever
known.  Had her mother not died when my wife was 13 and her father when she
was 18 she might have been able to attend college and attain the law degree
she always dreamed of.
She always believed that if you do good to others good would come to you.
We cared for both of my parents in their final six years through the very
ugliest situations by ourselves.  What effect this had on our sons we don't
know, but what Nancy Reagan is going through we did times two.
Now our income has been reduced to about 25% of what it was.   I work only
part time so I can care for my wife in the way she deserves.  All we want is
for the world to go away and take our creditors with it.  We have been sued
twice so far in small claims court.
I've taken too much of your e-mail time and haven't told 1/100th of it all.
We need help.  I am finding it harder and harder to keep from stopping at
the top of bridges and going over the top.
I'm sorry.  We tried to do the right things and life is so messed up now.

Keep your head up Jeb, you have many supporters.  Only Republican Gov. to be
reelected in our state.
God bless you and yours.

Dear Mr. Bush,
       My name is Kim Myers. After speaking with my friend Eddie Easton tonight he graciously provided your e-mail address and encouraged me to contact you.
       I have befriended and am desperately trying to help a family from the country of Argentina. They are in a difficult situation. Any help and or direction you might provide would be greatly appreciated.
       The husband, Juan, arrived in this country on 9/10/01. His wife and three children (ages 7, 10, 11) followed in Fed."02" on tourist visas.
       They immediately contacted a lawyer in our area who advertised himself as an immigration lawyer. He took their money ($3,500.00 cash) and told them he would file the appropriate papers to enable them to work and stay in this country. I have tried to speak to this lawyer myself. He will (literally) only scream and hang up on his clients and me.
       This family has entered our country legally and have now lapsed into illegal status due to the scam of a lawyer that was to help them. It embarrasses me as an American.
       You have my word that this family is law abiding, hard working and would be an asset to our country.
       Below I have listed some experiences and attributes I have personally witnessed as a small testimony of this families' character.
       > Juan, has a job waiting for him as an experienced pasta maker as soon as he can obtain legal status. 
       > The mother, Claudia, says "for my children I cannot go back. There is no food, no jobs, nothing. For my children, their future is here." Their children are everything to them.
       >Within a short period of time, all three children speak English fluently and excel in their school work.
       >Andreas (age 10) won athlete of the month at school in Jan. I drove his Mom to  school for the 20 minute ceremony. She was dressed in her best and bursting with pride.
       > They have little but what they have is cherished.
       > When I visited their 2 bedroom, 3rd floor apt. it was spotless and they were eager to show me around.
       > Both Juan and Claudia have repeatedly said they are willing to do whatever job necessary to stay in this country and provide for their family.
       >I have witnessed them walking great distances (no drivers license) in subzero weather to attend their children's school functions, get groceries or to sweep out a store front for a few dollars.
       > Their dream of dreams is to work, raise their family and pay their taxes in this country. 
       
       Mr. Bush, these are the type of immigrants who have made our country great.  (Their mail box, written in white paint, says "God Bless America" with sincerity)
       I have taken them to our local Congressman, Maurice Hinchey's office, His office contacted immigration and was told they have no choice but to leave the country unless they can somehow be granted amnesty. They can then try to apply for a temporary work Visa but having over stayed their tourist Visa may not be allowed to reenter the country.       
       I am willing to sponsor, be responsible for, financially or otherwise, or do whatever it takes to help this family.
       They came to America to build a better life and were immediately screwed over by a lawyer, who I believe never had any intentions of helping them.
       Please, is their anything you or the President can do to help? 
       Thank you so much for your patience.
                   Respectfully,
                         Kim A. Myers

Governor:

You know Edmund Benson from the Arise Foundation. He met with me recently, asked if I knew you (yes!), and asked me to put in a good word for him.

He's eager for you to visit an ARISE program at "any one of the 21 secure Department of Juvenile Justice facilities across the state." I've not visited this program, but have seen others.

I met him a dozen years ago when he was honored with The Herald's Spirit of Excellence award. Strikes me as a decent, caring person with a long record of community service.

He believes that this particular ARISE program has a real record of helping youthful offenders get back on the path to real contributions to communities.

You'll know best what to do.

Thanks.

Governor Bush,

Thank you for your direct e-mail. I apologize for the rushed question today
on your way back to the Marriott. I'd like to get your response, preferably
over the phone, to the following:

1)
In light of the way the Lott situation and the Bush Administration's
decision to file the affirmative-action brief have reinforced negative
images of the GOP among blacks, and President Bush's abysmally showing
among blacks in the last presidential election, our sense was that, among
other things, the GOP would take a more aggressive stance on education
reform. We find in national polls, for instance, that school choice is
favored by most blacks and overwhelmingly by inner-city blacks and young
African Americans. I wanted to get your thoughts on this as a tactical,
political matter. I BELIEVE THAT SCHOOL CHOICE ALTERNATIVES IS A GREAT ISSUE POLITICALLY FOR LOWER INCOME AMERICANS. MORE CHOICES WILL BENEFIT LOWER INCOME FOLKS DISPROPORTIONATELY. 

2)
The forthcoming Hoover Institution/Koret Task Force report is not as upbeat
about the NCLB as you were in your comments to me. It says: "The No Child
Left Benhind Act may help mobilize federal muscle to push states and
districts in the right direction. But Washington has scant leverage over
states and districts. NCLB has long, slow timelines -- and few sanctions
when states and districts do nopt meet those timelines. It imposes few real
consequences on educators whose schools fail. It is likely, therefore, to
make the biggest difference in places that share its gloals and have the
greatest capacity to attain them and to accomplish least in those places --
probably the neediest places -- where officials may not much care or simply
do not know how to go about achieving the goals."

You said during your speech to the Hoover Institution today that you can't
compromise on basic principle or you lose the very substance of what you're
trying to achieve. Many school-reform advocates claim that this is exactly
what happened with the crafting of the NCLB -- that key provisions,
"sticks" like the threat of school choice that would have made it more
effective, were systematically stripped out.

What are your thoughts on this, and on prospects for the NCLB and on ways
it could be made more effective. I understand that you see the federal
government's role in this as necessarily limited, but what else do you
think it should or shouldn't be doing in this regard? THE NCLB ROLE IS TO REQUIRE STATES TO HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES IN RETURN FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. STATES AND LOCALITIES HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING THE REFORMS AND THAT IS HOW IT SHOULD BE. I WOULD HATE TO SEE A NATIONAL EDUCATION SYSTEM. THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE UGLY.

3)

Our main interest, at this point, is figuring out what the GOP, Congress
and the White House might do next in this area. We'd appreciate anything
you could tell us about what the President or other GOP officials have told
you in this regard -- and what you've urged them to do. I HOPE STATES SEE THE ADVANTAGE OF HIGH STANDARDS, HIGH EXPECTATIONS, ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONSEQUENCES THAT ARE DIFFERENT BETWEEN SUCCESS IN TERMS OF ACHIEVEMENT AND MEDIOCRITY. TANGIBLE RESULTS IN TEXAS, NORTH CAROLINA AND FLORIDA SHOW THE WAY.

4)

My wife and I plan to be in Florida the week of April 19-27. It's supposed
to be a vacation, but I'd like to know if you'll be available for a
detailed one-our interview on your school reform efforts. I'm particularly
interested in the colorful details of what the experience has been like for
you personally in fighting this battle. CALL JILL.

As a fuller response to your initial question, we're interested in K-12 for
the simple reason that it is one of the critical long-term economic issues
facing the US.
I try to cover the US economy in all its dimensions.

I can be reached through any of the following...

Government in general is very risk adverse. Again, in general, there is little reward for taking risk and the downside is enormous. We have tried to change this by empowering risktakers. I provide support and take the heat but it is tough in a government setting. We don't do a good job at benchmarking risk. On the important stuff, we go for broke and fight to win!

Dear Governor Bush,

I work in the area of risk analysis and I am intrigued by how different
spheres of life identify and quantify risk.

How does the Florida State Government identify and quantify risk ?

Is there a correlation between any subsequent risk rankings and the
allocation of your and your Government's time and resources ?

How do you and your Government benchmark risk over time ?

Dear Mr. Governor,

 

I am writing in regards to a man named Howard Earl Thomas.  Currently, Mr. Thomas is incarcerated at the Hamilton Correctional Institution in Jasper, Florida. The reason for my correspondence is to inform you of what I consider to be an injustice that has occurred in our judicial system.

 

Mr. Thomas pled guilty to the charge of Falsifying Information on a Pawnbroker Transaction Form on case number 05-2002-CF-035155-AXXX-XX State of Florida vs. Thomas.  Please allow me to explain the circumstances of this guilty plea to you.

 

Mr. Thomas removed a boom box radio from his mothers' home, where he resides.  The radio belonged to his nephew, who also resides in the same home. He took the radio to a local Pawn Shop, with the intention of recovering it within the next few days.  He had recently started a new job, and needed to get a "loan" while waiting for his first pay check. 

 

Ms. Thelma Thomas, his mother, came home from work, and discovered that the radio was missing.  At the time she did not realize that it was in fact her son who had removed the radio from the house.  Ms. Thomas called the Brevard County Sheriffs Office, and filed a report. 

 

When the Sheriff's Deputy recovered the radio from the Pawn Shop, he asked the child who owned the radio to come down and identify it.  When the child confirmed that it was indeed his radio, he was asked to sign a form, in order to get the radio returned to him, and he did.

 

It wasn't until his uncle; Howard Thomas was arrested and charged with Grand Theft, Trafficking in Stolen Property, and Falsifying Information on a Pawnbroker Transaction Form that the child realized that he had in fact been signing to file charges, or that it had been his Uncle who had taken the radio. 

 

At this point, the child, along with his grandmother, Thelma Thomas went to the State Attorney's office, and asked that the charges be dropped.  They filled out all of the necessary paperwork, explaining that it had been a misunderstanding.  That they had not intended to file any charges, and that they had not realized that it was Mr. Thomas who had taken the radio.  They were under the impression that their home had been burglarized, which it had not.  The State Attorney put the paperwork into the file, but then decided to proceed with the case anyhow.

 

Mr. Thomas initially pled not guilty, and requested a jury trial.  When he appeared in court for jury selection, he was offered a plea agreement from the state.  At the time that Mr. Thomas signed the plea agreement, he was being represented by a public defender.  He was lead to believe that by signing the agreement, he would receive two years probation for the charge of Falsifying Information on a Pawnbroker Transaction Form, and that the State of Florida would then agree to Nolle Prosequi the other two charges.

 

When Mr. Thomas appeared for his sentencing, the state did in fact agree to Nolle Prosequi the Grand Theft and Trafficking in Stolen Property charges.  However, they requested that Mr. Thomas be sentenced to prison rather than probation.

 

I'm sure that you are aware of the points system used to determine a sentence.  According to this system, a person should not be sentenced to prison unless they score over a certain amount of points.  Mr. Thomas had a score of twenty eight, which is well under the level required to be sentenced to prison.

 

After being sentenced to what he and many others, including the "victims" of his "crime" consider being an unreasonable amount of time, Mr. Thomas then decided to file a motion to mitigate or reduce his sentence.  The presiding Judge agreed to have a hearing on this motion.  The Judge also signed an order for transport from the Department of Corrections to Brevard County Jail so that Mr. Thomas could be present for the hearing.  

 

Unfortunately, Mr. Thomas was not transported by the Florida Department of Corrections as had been ordered by the judge. His lawyer advised him that he would simply ask for a continuance, in order to allow Mr. Thomas to be present for the hearing.

 

At the hearing, Thelma Thomas, along with the child who owned the radio in question in this case were scheduled to testify on Mr. Thomas' behalf.  There were several other character witnesses who also planned to testify.  They were told by Mr. Thomas' attorney not to come to court on the day of the hearing, as he was simply going to have the case continued.

 

When the hearing came up, the attorney instead waived Mr. Thomas' appearance, and the motion was then denied.  

 

At this point in time, Mr. Thomas has served nine months of a three and a half year sentence.  A sentence which is well over the guidelines for the charge of Falsifying Information on a Pawnbroker Transaction Form.  

I have discussed the case with an attorney, who has said that he can help, but for a fee of $10,000.  I am a single mother of two children, and I simply cannot afford to pay this fee.  He does not have the money to hire an attorney, and the public defender has long ago requested to be withdrawn from the case, a request which was granted.

 

Mr. Thomas has two children, a boy, twelve; and a girl, four.  He has a loving family who would love nothing more than to have him home with them, where he rightfully should be.  I am his fiancé and I am anxiously awaiting his return home, so that they we can get married, and move on with our lives.  This entire case was handled incorrectly from the beginning, and Mr. Thomas has certainly paid his debt to society.

 

Therefore, I respectfully request that a pardon be issued in this case, and Mr. Thomas be allowed to return home and resume his life.

 

I thank you for your time and attention to this matter, and thank you in advance for the understanding and compassion that I know you will exhibit.

 

Respectfully Submitted,

 

 

 

Tina-Marie Kelly

Subject: Bright Future Scholarships



Dear Governor Bush,

I am a concerned mother of a son who attends Florida State University currently enrolled in the Pre-Med program there.  He has 19 credits left to graduate.  We have been so honored to have a son to be able to attend college since his dad and I don't make that kind of money from our two salaries.  We are both employed with the St. Lucie County School Board.

Our son would have never had the opportunity to attend college if it weren't for the Bright Future Scholarship.  He has never played in sports, his scholarship is for academics.    I was very upset to hear the news you may end this scholarship.  I hope the days aren't gone that only the rich or minorities will be able to attend college.  Not only would my son have to leave college but so many other students would lose out as well.

My son isn't lazy, he has worked full time jobs while attending college the whole time.  He began as a phlebotomist and worked at our two local hospitals for two years prior to attending Florida State University and once completing his two year degree from our local Indian River Community College he became a Certified Lab Technician at Tallahassee Memorial where he currently works full time on the third shift.  He lives on his own.  We send him as much money as we can.  He is really concerned he will have to quit college because of this scholarship being discontinued.

Isn't there something we can do to keep this scholarship continuing?

My name is Ann Dunshee, my address is 1820 South 28th Street, Fort Pierce, FL  34947.

My work number is (772) 468-5282 (Garden City Elementary School)

My evening home phone number is (772) 461-2907.

I am willing to do anything I can to keep the Bright Future Scholarship in place.

Please let me know what I can do.

Mrs. Ann Dunshee

I pay attention and in the time between slides I just click the heels of my ruby red slippers together and mutter silently to myself "I am not a social worker!".

Take care, good luck with the agenda this session.

Gentlemen,

Sorry I bothered you all.... (see Abe's message to me below). 

I'm a relapsed terminal cancer patient with no family heirs and I wanted
to donate a high six figure sum of estate money to your new motion
support for Mr. Amos King and now understand that even if a person
openly confessed to the murder, any new motion is forever barred by the
Governor, as that is the criminal legal system in this state.  Very sad.

It's going on 4:30 a.m., on the dawn of the "last day" of Amos King's
life and I haven't slept all night...... praying.  This will be my last
message on the subject as I'm leaving town on a trip this morning.  

May God bless the Governor, Jeb Bush and Amos King and may he have mercy
on all of your souls, if Amos is really an innocent man and is being
murdered.

.......and may God bless his soul if he is a guilty man.

.......now, we will "never know" for sure, will we?  ...... all just
because he never had a fair jury trial and much exculpable evidence was
knowingly withheld..... by two very corrupt and biased Pinellas County
judges who both openly hated Amos King....... so, who cares? ..... so
what!?

I was only sincerely trying to help...... no need to respond.....
goodbye and all the best...... the "judicial system" in Pinellas County
has been very corrupted and broken.

Very Very Sadly, John Schestag

David,

Just a quick note to touch base. I know that you have been traveling as has
the Governor and I wanted to make sure you both knew how interested and
excited I am in the DMS role.

As we have previously discussed, I will be available by mid April (just a
few short weeks away). I am more than ready to engage immediately and expect
an extremely short learning curve. My time on the DMS transition team
briefed me on all of the major issues and I have a good feel for the people.
I am also prepared to do whatever it takes in the next few weeks to step
immediately into the saddle.

Thanks for your help in this process.  I understand the Governor's need to
move quickly but we are almost there. It would be a shame if he lost out on
his first choice over a few weeks.

I will be in Tallahassee on business Monday and Tuesday next week. If you
have time, I'd love to take you to lunch.

Kind Regards,

Bill Simon

the

Dear Governor Bush:

I am pleased that you have named Kevin McCarty as interim Director of Office of Insurance Regulation and encourage you to make such appointment permanent.  As an elected Republican constitutional officer responsible for protecting the insurance buying public in Georgia, I recognize the challenges posed by balancing consumer protection and the need for a strong, competitive market.  Kevin shares my belief that the state insurance regulation plays a vital role in ensuring that insurers act responsibly while they have the ability to offer a variety of products to meet market needs.

I have had the pleasure of working with Kevin since 1995 and have consistently been impressed by his breadth of knowledge on insurance issues and his ability to craft creative and realistic solutions to the variety of problems faced by state insurance regulators.  Kevin is recognized within the National Association of Insurance Commissioners as a committed, knowledgeable regulator willing to tackle difficult issues.  He will surely serve Florida well as Director of Office of Insurance Regulation.

Thank you for your consideration of the letter.

With kindest personal regards, I am

Sincerely,

John W. Oxendine
Insurance & Safety Fire Commissioner

Dear Governor Jeb,
 
I hope you and your family are well.  I would like to take this opportunity to ask a favor of you. 
My daughter Ana M. Piazza, send you a copy of a letter which she send to Standard Insurance Company.  This letter was a request from my daughter for a review of her wrongful termination of employment.  Basically, because she requested a relocation from a hostile and unsafe environment and because she also blew the whistle on others in charge, they retaliated and she was dismissed without cause.  I know how busy you are, but all we are asking is for the opportunity for someone in your staff to be aware of this letter since we copied you c/o Ellie Ferrara.  This issue is something that will ultimately will have to be resolved by the company and those involved in this unfortunate act.  After securing advise from the EEOC in Tampa, she was told to write a good faith letter to her employers and see how the process develops.  She also wanted Ellie Ferrara to pass a copy of this letter to you.   For the most part, making  those in Authority such as yourself aware of things that take place in the work place seems to make things happen.  Sometimes, people out here have to endure all kinds of discrimination and retaliations from employers located in the State of Florida and they seem to get away with.  Anything that you can do will be greatly appreciate.
 
Thank your attention and for taking the time to see the documented sent to you.
 
Respectfully, 
Ken and Ana Davey.

Dear Governor Bush:

My husband and I are meeting with Ms. Pate as you requested on March 7 at 
10:00 am.  Perhaps your schedule permits you to drop in for just a few 
minutes?  If not, we understand.  Scott, my husband, met you briefly during a 
JNC meeting in Tallahassee.

I received several e-mails from people across the state regarding the 
appointment of Dr. Alex Penn-Williams.  Although the original e-mail I 
received was not supportive of Dr. Penn-Williams and encouraged recipients to 
e-mail you and Secretary Horne and ask that the position be filled by someone 
outside of government, I must say after doing some research I believe she 
will serve the people of the State of Florida extremely well.  Her reputation 
is stellar and she is highly respected in my county.  I can't imagine a 
person more qualified and understanding of the issues facing those she will 
serve.  Please don't let this exceptional public servant go!

Subject: Arrest of Hialeah Gardens City Councilman Miguel Haddad


FYI - Haddad was arrested at approx. 1515 hrs. this date by Miami-Dade PD &
FDLE for alledgedly offering a bride to an individual who was going to
oppose him in the city election.  The bride took the form of a promise of an
appointment to a city position.

 We will attempt to obtain his cooperation before it is learned by others
that Haddad has been had. 

At this time, no information is being released pending the outcome of his
willingness to cooperate on other matters involving the commission.

Update: 

On Wednesday, February 26, 2003, a meeting was held at Metro PC Squad and
Spanish translators reviewed a telephone recording made between our target
(HADDAD) and victim (GONZALEZ).  After further review it appeared that
HADDAD did not withdraw from his criminal act (Voter Fraud Felony).  The
State Attorney's Office has concurred with our findings, and authorized the
arrest of HADDAD Remuneration by a Candidate for Services, a third degree
felony.  FL State Statue: 104.071. I will notify you when we place HADDAD in
custody.

Hi Jeb 

It was great seeing you for a few seconds at Deering Bay last Sunday. Thanks for stopping. 

I'm on a plane this morning back up to Boston, via Dulles, and just read today's article in the Washington Post. Actually, to my untrained eye, it seems pretty positive.

I've been meaning to write or call to ask who I should speak to at the State of Florida about the State looking at our web-based energy monitoring, control and conservation System.  WebGen (www.webgensystems.com) is presently using its artificial intelligence to monitor and/or control energy consumption at many (65) of the State of Callifornia's largest buildings and we are now producing significant energy consumption and dollar savings (documented now in excess of 10%).  We're currently in negotiations with the State of Massachusetts; are running almost 100 of Bank of America's major and minor buildings across California and elsewhere (including installations occuring now at several of its 'critical facilities'); continue to provide energy conservation and dollar savings to University of Miami (documented by Dr. Alex Domijan, Director of the Florida Power Affiliates and Power Quality Lab at the University of Florida); and are now installing in a number of other customers in California, Florida, New England and New York, We just completed an installation in Coral Gables for Philip Blumberg and had entered into serious conversations with George Kirkpatrick and ICUF prior to George's untimely death.

I would very much appreciate it if you'd be willing to direct me to the relevant person in the State. I believe that what we're doing is a logical and now-proven platform for you to introduce a really significant BHAG of permanently reducing energy consumption in Florida by at least an additional 10% beyond existing State connservation/curtailment programs. 

Dorothy sends her regards and our best to Columba and the kids. 

I'll look forward to hearng from you. 

Best, 

David

Jeb,

Great article in the Post on you this past weekend.   Nice picture of you and Columba on the front page.   Why were you two holding two bibles for the swearing in?

I have an idea that will maybe help you with this Everglades project.   I believe the S. FL Water Management Board should use an agent or a front group to make offers to the private owners who are being asked to sell.   

You may remember how Disney World bought all the land in 1972 they needed in Central FL to build Disney World by keeping the name of the real buyer secret.   If the sellers knew that they were selling to Disney World, or even that is was part of a giant land buy, they would have insisted on more money.   That is what is happening with the land purchases for the Everglades Restoration project.   The purchase prices for all these deals seem to always be inflated because the sellers know they can get more from the government because of the reasons I mentioned.

I think the State of FL should use some agent, or agents,  to buy the land that is needed for this big Everglades Project.   I understand that the Sunshine laws require transparency.   Fine.   That can be done while still keeping some details bureaucratically buried.   Same thing with the SFWMB having to have hearings and approving the sales contracts.   What is needed here is a little legal imagination and creativity otherwise I fear you will never come up with enough money to pay for this and it will take forever.    

Have one your folks lookup the day Disney stood up and announced that they had bought half of Orange county or whatever county it was.   Everyone was shocked and surprised.   But Disney would still be trying to do it if it was publicly know they were trying to do it.

Just an idea,
Mauricio

Hi Jeb:
 
Further to our conversation, I am sending you the info. for the event on April 4th in Hernando County.
 
This is the major fundraising event of the year for Hernando Christian Academy.  HCA is the largest independent school in the county and has several major county families in attendance.    It is known as the Annual Support Dinner.  As I explained to Alan, we would like for you to be the Guest of Honor and Guest Speaker for the event.   Dinner begins at 7 p.m. with various students being showcased during this time.  
 
At approximately 8 p.m, David Holtzhouse ( Head School Administrator) will make a brief presentation followed by your introduction at approximately 8:15 p.m.  Your speech could last until approximately 8:45 p.m.   If you are agreeable, we would like for your topic to be "Recapturing Traditional Christian Family Values and Education".
 
We are hopeful to have 350 - 400 persons in attendance.
 
As time is drawing near, your consideration would be greatly appreciated. 
 
Re:  Tourism - on a different note!
 
I checked with Bud Nocera and he would love for you to be at the upcoming Visit Fl. meeting.  Afterall, you are our Chairman.
 
The meeting is on March 13th beginning at 9 a.m. until  around 11a.m. (much like last year) at he University Center Club (3rd floor).
 
Also, would it be possible, at Visist Florida's expense, to hold a reception at the mansion (like last year)  on March 12th from 5-7 p.m.?  This was a big success last year and Bud feels (as do I) that it would be quite appropriate.
 
Apparently, he sent this request to Pam as well so you may hear it twice.
 
It was great to talk to you tonight.  Thanks for the encouraging words.
 
I look forward to hearing from you soon,  best wishes -

Dear Governor Bush:


I kept my silence for a long time because I have a lot of unpleasant things going on. By listening to Alex Arreaza by saying that you don't like me, why do I have to kill myself for. First I am black, second I am Haitian, third I am poor. It took me a long time to get over it and not to say anthing. Although  I know its not true, but it hurts me anyway. Also he wants to use me for his own purpose, in which I don't want to be used. I had a car accident in 2001 and he took my case and then he threw out my case. He used my car accident case to influence my judgment by saying this person likes me and this person does not. The last incident was at the 27th of Jan. 2003 at the election of Vice chairman. He expected me to stand up and nominate him to be vice chairman. I refused to do so. Then he told me if I don't stand up to nominate him he will through out my case. Prior to that he said he will mess up my case to bad that no other lawyer will be able to help me.He then in turn threw out my case because I refused. I totally think this is wrong for someone to bribe another person. 

According to my members of the Haitian American Republican Caucus they want to elect Mr. Al Cadenas to Lieutenant Governor. Like you know by the year 2000 to 2002 I have recruited 27,000 people for the Republican party. Also I have 4 active Caucuses and 3 more on the way. So far we have over 2,000 members that wish to send you the petition for Mr. Al Cadenas. I want to thank you for everything and I will you see tomorrow in Orlando.


                                                                   Sincerely

I hate bothering you, but here is a person severelly disabled that I have know for many years that her and the company she works for have been a loyal supporter of our party that truly needs your assistance.  If there is anything your office can do to assist or recommend please do so.  She works while being disabled and still has worked your entire life for a company called Digital SOuth Communication.  I have called on this individual and her employer many times for support of the cause of our party and they have allways given without thought.  Please assist in helping find a solution for this wonderful lady.

P.S.  Audrey can be reached at 727-441-2700





Paul, I just wanted to know if you knew where I could send my plea for intercession if it comes to that.  I tried to be as brief as I could.  If you need clarification, please call me. Thank you, appreciate whatever advise you can render.  Audrey

In 1997, case # 90017779CI, I contacted the Dept. of Revenue Child Support Enforcement Division, in order to get court ordered child support as well as court ordered spousal support.  At that time the children were 15 & 17.

He lives out of state, and basically all this time he has been doing many legal maneuverings, to avoid paying court ordered support.  He has hired attorneys in NJ as well as FL.  

Finally, in 12/2000 he voluntarily had his wages garnished, thus bypassing NJ enforcement of the Florida order.  The net effect of that was when he lost his job in Jan 2001, there was no garnishment of his unemployment checks.  

In order for him to once again be garnished he had to be brought back to court once again in NJ.  He was served papers and ordered to appear.  He then rehired the FL attorney to file motions in Florida, in order to postpone the NJ hearings.

We had a hearing scheduled for 12/31/02, but at the last minute, (and I was never notified) his attorney canceled stating that he did not know it was a DOR case.
Which is not correct, as he was the same attorney who represented him in 12/00.

From what I understand, my ex's attorney does not think the State of Florida should be representing me as my children have reached majority.   

This was brought up 2 years ago and I found the following, "A child support enforcement hearing officer is an attorney who has been appointed by administrative order of the court to take testimony and recommend decision in cases involving the establishment, enforcement, and/or modification of child support and the enforcement of alimony in conjunction with an ongoing child support arrearage order."

I believe based on that, the state continued to enforce my spousal support because it was all part of the original court order.  

They (my ex and his FL attorney) are trying now to get the State of Florida out of the picture, because they know full well, I have limited financial means and would not be able to continue the legal battle for him to pay his arrears and continued spousal support.

The state's attorney told me, that it is up to the DOR on how they interpret the Florida statues.  He said that I would know in about 3 weeks if they would continue to pursue the matter.  He said that I may have to hire an attorney, (economically impossible) or go it on my own.

I did not want to wait to the last minute, and wanted someone -- somewhere to know of this and the damaging precedent it could create.  That parents who avoid paying, by manipulating the system to their advantage (filing motions, etc.) to avoid paying court ordered support till the child or children reach majority. So they can then say, well children our of age why are you still representing her?  

This to me is an outrage.  I am disabled, and have raised 2 children alone, worked 2 jobs, and among family, friends and our church we got along.  I am proud to say without any public assistance.  

If the DOR bows out from my case, I will not be able to pursue him. I am trying to locate someone in government now, make them aware of my present circumstances, and if necessary could and would be willing to intercede on my behalf with DOR to continue with my case should it come to that.

Thank you,

Audrey

We are delighted to announce that, for the second year in a row, ARAMARK has been named the No. 1 company in “Diversified Outsourcing Services” in FORTUNE Magazine’s new ranking of America’s Most Admired Companies.  Even more impressively, ARAMARK has moved from No. 48 to No. 10 in overall score among the 580 companies included in the survey.  (FORTUNE’s “Top Ten” in the magazine is based on number of votes, not overall score.)  This is a remarkable accomplishment.  All of you should feel extremely proud for having achieved this outstanding milestone.
The individual results of the survey are also the best ever for us across the board.  Our overall score was our highest ever (8.06 up from 7.29 last year).  We improved our position in every measure of success and achieved our highest rankings ever in every category (see attached charts).  Most notably, in the overall ranking we scored among the highest in Quality of Management, Use of Corporate Assets and Long-term Investment Value.

Subject: Oversight Board-MDCPS


Dear Jeb,
            I hope the appointments on the oversight board are not for members hoping to extend their political careers using the School Board as bully pulpits.  Furthermore, I am very concerned at the School Board's lack of leadership on this issue.  It seems we are floundering and there is really no position taken.
            I will propose that the School Board take a position asap and thereby offer some direction to the apparent impasse between the Oversight Board and the union.  
            I must commend Mr. Ed London.  His work has been very helpful to the process, as has been the rest of the oversight team so far.  However, I feel Mr. London has gone beyond the call of duty trying to get to the heart of problems.  Can we clone him?  
            "Saludos a su familia..."  Cordially, Marta Perez

Dear Jeb,
 
Your speech was great at the ceremony.  Unfortunately, today's Herald helps to point out some of the horrors at MDCPS's construction that I have tried to get my colleagues to see since I was elected to the board.  As I hope you know, I have been a lone voice, often the subject of ridicule, for what was staring the board in the face for quite some time.  Anyway, keep up the good work.  Regards to your family.  Cordially, Marta

Subject: RE: Partisan Politics on the Board
Dear Jeb,
            I don't need to tell you how difficult politics is, and I respect all you are trying to do to increase the education level of the students of Florida.  Dade County has the highest stakes in the "dogs" in this fight, because our board represents the largest amount of children.  Unfortunately, the teacher's union has consolidated a majority on our board.  They are now voting as a block, largely to protest the Advisory Board.  This Democratic block is the same group that fiercely supported your opponent.  As our very qualified governor, I hope you will lend a hand to those of us who are in the minority.  If we are to serve our students to the best of our abilities, we need to convince the Democrats on the board to vote for what is best for our students, and not merely the support Mr. Tornillo's party line.
            I believe that it is also important to caution your Advisory Oversight Board of the political games that are being played on the MDCPS board.  This may help them direct their comments to the realities of Mr. Tornillo's control over many of the board members' fears.
            We can make this a winning situation for our students and constituents, but it is going to take thoughtful calculations.  As a reminder, School Board elections are NONPARTISAN in order to protect our students.
            As always, I support you and feel that you act out of conviction for what is best for the education of the state.  
Cordially, Marta

Governor,

Several years ago, you provided this address so that I could contact you
from time to time.  Well, here is one of those times.

My church will celebrate our 75th Anniversary on March 2, 2003.  It
would be
wonderful if you could provide a proclamation honoring this milestone.
I
have written this to you so that you could forward it among you staff
for
processing, if you desire.

Attached is a proclamation draft for the State of Florida.  It's rough
so if
you have more to add, or if it's too long, just make the changes.

We'll need it for the weekend celebration on March 2.  If your staff
could
send it so the it would arrive well before March 1 (I know that's
pushing
it) it would be great.  If not, we will be glad to present it at a later
date.

Thanks for your help and for your leadership,

Robert Stuart

This is unacceptable because of the great misunderstandings that occur in what homeschooling is and how it should function.

First let me say that I am uncomfortable doing this but I am confident that God
has "told" me to. Please try to understand that I do not have perfect hearing in
this area and very well know it. However  I am trying very hard to walk with God
and that means when I believe He is telling me to do something I have to do it
or at least give my best shot. No I am not Jim Jones ( I am sure you remember
him ). While praying about this situation as my niece asked me to I kept getting
the impression to share it with you. I argued with God. That is pointless but I
still do it sometimes. So much for the background.
Now when I give the details here you will be in trouble if what I am sharing
comes about even if you do nothing. Mike Thomas will say "see Jeb is doing
favors" even though you didn't do anything.
Now here goes.
My niece is an auditor in the auditor general's office. She believes that the
organization will be abolished or reorganized and she will  be without a job and
she needs the job.

regarding my personal situation that you were advising me could become
public. I
am not concerned if that became public since I am a nobody it would not
be of
any interest to any one who knew it, but I don't want to get you into a
turmoil.

Is there any way I could communicate this need privately???

I think Bob Ballard might have seen them all. Not sure about anyone else. 
I'm sure someone has. Wendy has seen more than 130.

Strangely, two of the four left are parks right here. One is Addison Block 
House, a sugar mill-era ruin on an island in Tomoka State Park and the other 
is Haw Creek, a boat access only deep in the remote wilds of Flagler County. 
It took me awhile to get them to tell me where the block house was. It's 
crumbling and they don't have the money to stabilize it so it's a closely 
held secret.  Then there's Atlantic Ridge, which hasn't opened yet in South 
Florida. The final one is San Pedro, an underwater archaeological site about 
a mile south of Indian Key State Park in the Keys. We rented a boat once and 
went to Ligumvitae Key and Indian Key but there were heavy squalls off shore 
from a dissipating tropical storm and the water was rough and too cloudy to 
see the shipwreck even if we'd gone all the way out there.


Last weekend we saw Tarkilyn Bayou and the white pitcher plants there. It's 
a pretty cool place. We saw the Desoto Site and rode our 9-year-old daughter 
through downtown Tallahassee at night to show her the sites.

It's a great education for the kids, history, botany, and geography kind of 
all thrown together. On a side note, during our trip through the Panhandle, 
our little girl was keeping track of license plates and we saw license 
plates from 38 states and four Canadian provinces in about 24 hours! We 
couldn't believe it.

The parks thing really started on a lark when our boys were small and they 
were in Cub Scouts. There were only 105 parks then and I wasn't even 
working. We didn't think it would be too complicated. Thanks to P2000 they 
just kept adding parks. Now our boys are Eagle Scouts and leaving home and 
we're still trying to finish up. My kids are seventh-generation Floridians 
in a couple of lines and I really wanted them to know and understand 
Florida. (One of my great-great grandfathers was a 17-year-old bugler in the 
Second Seminole Indian War and I recently found out we might be related to 
one of the signers of the state constitution. Maybe that would be handy if I 
ever do get into politics!)

I think Secretary Struhs and Wendy are talking about going with us to see 
the last one -- San Pedro -- in April or May. They're hoping I'll do a big 
splashy story on our parks effort in time for state parks month in May. In a 
way it feels a little weird to do a story about it because it started as our 
own little family thing, but my editors are all excited about the story also 
so I guess I'm committed.

Sorry for this third e-mail today, but I thought you might want to see this.

EDUCATION WRITER
Last updated: Feb 26, 12:07 AM

SAMSULA -- The Atlantic High School honor student with dyslexia who hasn't 
passed the state test required for a diploma may be able to graduate after 
all -- without passing the test.

The Volusia County School District will apply this week for a waiver to 
exempt senior Gary Lester from the graduation requirement to pass the 
Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test, school Superintendent Bill Hall told 
the Volusia County School Board on Tuesday.

Until now, officials with the state Department of Education indicated they 
wouldn't grant a waiver. But it appears the state is softening its stance as 
graduation day nears for hundreds of successful students, including Gary, 
17, whose learning disabilities have prevented them from passing FCAT, Hall 
said.

Volusia school officials said they won't wait long for an answer from the 
state. If the Department of Education denies the request for a waiver, or 
doesn't provide an answer soon, the School Board may sue the state. School 
Board attorney Ted Doran said the school district would have a strong legal 
case.

Dear Governor Bush,
FYI. A prominent Senate leader recently told a group of Jacksonville physicians that the professional liability issue would not be resolved until "there is blood in the streets." It is most disappointing to hear such talk -- sad really -- especially when the issue can be resolved before the health and well being of the people of Florida is jeopardized. This is the reason we are fighting the good fight and, working with you, we will do all we can to make sure that nothing approaching this occurs.
Thank you for your unwavering support.

Governor,
 
As you may be aware, Major General (retired) Ron Harrison is President of the Florida National Guard Foundation, Inc. This is a  "501-C-3"organization. It's mission is support of our Guardsmen,  with its main focus on the enlisted force and asssitance with their needs, emergency relief, and emergency support for their families. The fund particularily supports the emergency relief efforts of the Family Readiness Mission...an outreach to resource needs of soldiers' families during times of emergencies.  The money has very close oversight and is "dollar-for dollar" in support of our soldiers. As our soldiers deploy, the needs of the families will come to the forefront of Family Readiness.  Many folks have asked how they can help.  The mechanism of choice (and properly sanctioned) is the Florida National Guard Foundation, Inc. This a "Direct Support" organization sanctioned under Section "250" of the Fla Statutes. The Florida National Guard Foundation is audited by State Auditors--specifically the State Inspector General assigned to the Florida National Guard.
 
Question:  Can we have your "sanction" to proceed with General Harrison's response to Senator George Firestone's offer to raise funds for this "sanctioned" organiztions' efforts to assist our soldiers. As you can see from below, Senator Firestone's outreach efforts include former Governors Askew and Martinez.  Senator Firestone came to us with this proposal to assist. It was unsolicited by either the Fla Nat'l Guard or General Harrison.
 
Should you require a more in-depth briefing, I can do that when we meet Friday at Eglin AFB.
 
Regards,
 
Doug Burnett

Doug, 
 
Once again thanks for allowing me to be President of the Florida National Guard Foundation Inc during this critical time.  The Board of Directors has been working hard to develop a strategy to increase the community support to the Foundation so we may in turn provide funds necessary to accomplish our goals, with urgent interest in supporting the families in financial need who can't be assisted through government channels during this crisis.  The needs increase each day and will, as deployments continue and become elongated. 
 
Fortunately, there is a mechanism Florida has that most states do not have and that is through the Direct Support Organization of the Department of Military Affairs, a 501c(3) Foundation.  To that end the Board authorized me to contact supporters throughout the state to make them aware of the needs. 
 
In my contact with former Senator George Firestone, he and Mrs. Firestone have become very enthusiastic and he wants to form a citizen's select committee of the Foundation made up of former governors of the state and other leaders to assist in raising funds for the foundation. Our by-laws certainly support this and the priority use of the funds would be to support families in need through the Foundation to the Family Readiness Emergency Relief organization administered by CW 4 Bobbi Hall. The secondary use will be to support the National Guard in it's commitment to the nation, state, and local communities.
 
It is necessary in our view that you and Governor Bush are aware of this idea of a citizens select committee of the Foundation.  If there are questions and /or counsel please advise.  We have a mechanism to give support and peace of mind to our soldiers and airmen and their families and look forward to building our resources so no need is rejected for lack of funds. 
 
My continued compliments on the great work you and your leaders are doing thereby setting a national standard.

P.S.  Audrey can be reached at 727-441-2700





Paul, I just wanted to know if you knew where I could send my plea for
intercession if it comes to that.  I tried to be as brief as I could.
If you need clarification, please call me. Thank you, appreciate
whatever advise you can render.  Audrey

In 1997, case # 90017779CI, I contacted the Dept. of Revenue Child
Support Enforcement Division, in order to get court ordered child
support as well as court ordered spousal support.  At that time the
children were 15 & 17.

He lives out of state, and basically all this time he has been doing
many legal maneuverings, to avoid paying court ordered support.  He
has
hired attorneys in NJ as well as FL.  

Finally, in 12/2000 he voluntarily had his wages garnished, thus
bypassing NJ enforcement of the Florida order.  The net effect of that
was when he lost his job in Jan 2001, there was no garnishment of his
unemployment checks.  

In order for him to once again be garnished he had to be brought back
to
court once again in NJ.  He was served papers and ordered to appear. 
He
then rehired the FL attorney to file motions in Florida, in order to
postpone the NJ hearings.

We had a hearing scheduled for 12/31/02, but at the last minute, (and
I
was never notified) his attorney canceled stating that he did not know
it was a DOR case.
Which is not correct, as he was the same attorney who represented him
in
12/00.

From what I understand, my ex's attorney does not think the State of
Florida should be representing me as my children have reached
majority.


This was brought up 2 years ago and I found the following, "A child
support enforcement hearing officer is an attorney who has been
appointed by administrative order of the court to take testimony and
recommend decision in cases involving the establishment, enforcement,
and/or modification of child support and the enforcement of alimony in
conjunction with an ongoing child support arrearage order."

I believe based on that, the state continued to enforce my spousal
support because it was all part of the original court order.  

They (my ex and his FL attorney) are trying now to get the State of
Florida out of the picture, because they know full well, I have
limited
financial means and would not be able to continue the legal battle for
him to pay his arrears and continued spousal support.

The state's attorney told me, that it is up to the DOR on how they
interpret the Florida statues.  He said that I would know in about 3
weeks if they would continue to pursue the matter.  He said that I may
have to hire an attorney, (economically impossible) or go it on my
own.

I did not want to wait to the last minute, and wanted someone --
somewhere to know of this and the damaging precedent it could create.
That parents who avoid paying, by manipulating the system to their
advantage (filing motions, etc.) to avoid paying court ordered support
till the child or children reach majority. So they can then say, well
children our of age why are you still representing her?  

This to me is an outrage.  I am disabled, and have raised 2 children
alone, worked 2 jobs, and among family, friends and our church we got
along.  I am proud to say without any public assistance.  

If the DOR bows out from my case, I will not be able to pursue him. I
am
trying to locate someone in government now, make them aware of my
present circumstances, and if necessary could and would be willing to
intercede on my behalf with DOR to continue with my case should it
come
to that.

Thank you,

Audrey

Subject: Your last term

Dear Governor;

I used to think the reason you caved into the environmental extremist
organizations like Save the Manatee Club (SMC) was because you needed their
support to get reelected.  But now that's behind you and you still seem to
be bent over in their direction.

Your statement that, "I support sensible regulations that protect threatened
and endangered species in an economically responsible manner" sounds good,
but let's examine it.

 First, on what basis have you determined that the regulations such as the
slow speed zones are sensible?  There is no study that shows such zones
improve the protection for manatees from collisions with vessels, but there
is empirical scientific data that shows such zones exacerbate the
probability of collision in turbid or murky waters, which is most of
Florida.  Therefore, your assumption that the regulations "...are sensible
and protect..." is without merit.

Second, your statement also assumes that the manatee is " threatened and
endangered species."  Even the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation
Commission - Florida Marine Research Institute staff have agreed that the
manatee should be down listed (see September 30, 2003 Report on same).  The
manatee is flourishing, and its population is exploding at an exponential
net growth rate of ~ 6 % per annum.  Attempts to down play the reality of
these numbers by SMC have all backfired because it is obvious to all who use
or live on our waterways, that there are a lot more manatees.

Third, "...in an economically responsible manner," indicates that you are
aware of the financial impact resulting from these regulations and have
decided that it is a reasonable trade.  Where is that economics impact
assessment?  Have you listened to the Marine Industry, waterfront
homeowners, and boaters?  I know you haven't in Brevard County, because
we've asked to present data to you many times, and you have refused to meet
and listen to us.

So, Governor, your politically correct statement doesn't seem to hold water,
because the regulations are not sensible; they do not protect the
flourishing manatee species in most of the waterways; and it is not
economically responsible, but rather irresponsible.  Governor, you can not
dismiss this as another whining citizenry, because we can provide the data
and scientific evidence that refutes your assumptions.

You don't need to keep campaigning, you've got the job.  Why not dedicate
your last term to do what is right and listen to the real facts, then act
like a Republican Governor who refuses to relegate the rights of his
constituents as inferior to those of a flourishing animal species.  I
suggest one of the first thing you do is to sue the USFWS who are violating
our state sovereignty.

I know how busy you are, just returning from the NGA meeting and with the
Legislature in session.

However, I would very much like the opportunity to meet with you and your
idea of meeting in Miami was a good one.

My assistant, Janet Means, is in contact with Charla Sasser in your office

BUSYTOWN(tm) OPENS AT MOSI
TAMPA, Fla. (Feb. 18, 2003) - MOSI presents a new bi-lingual interactive
science exhibit based on the stories of world-renowned author/illustrator
Richard Scarry.  The exhibit, BUSYTOWN, opens May 17 for young visitors and
their families.
	From conveyor belts and cranes, to a tunnel and a telephone booth,
this exhibit encourages busy hands and racing minds to explore The Busy
World of Richard Scarry!  Young visitors, ages two through ten, will work,
create, play and explore the wonders of the every day working world within
BUSYTOWN, an exhibit under license from Viacom Consumer Products, the
licensing division for Paramount Pictures, which was created and designed by
OMSI.  The exhibit utilizes the content, settings, characters and challenges
portrayed in Scarry's books and on the animated television series, THE BUSY
WORLD OF RICHARD SCARRY(tm).  Visitors will recognize Lowly Worm, Huckle
Cat, Hilda Hippo, Sergeant Murphy, Mr. Frumble and the other beloved animal
characters, which were introduced more than thirty years ago by Scarry.
	Scientific processes, mathematical concepts, motor skills,
coordination, self-confidence, communication and cooperation are just a few
of the concepts and attitudes promoted to enhance early childhood education
throughout the exhibition.  Some of the activities offered within BUSYTOWN
include counting, sorting, weighing, and building.  Young visitors can
"play" the part of a factory worker, crane operator, and construction
worker.  There are time clocks, railroad tracks, conveyor belts, tunnels, a
cargo ship, funnel phones, carts and more.  Air hoses can be used to
activate pinwheels and other air-powered objects.  Workers can create their
own structures using a variety of blocks and building materials.  Also
within BUSYTOWN, parents can find information, suggestions, and helpful
hints that will assist them while observing and interacting with their
children.
	BUSYTOWN will be on display at MOSI through Sept. 14.  MOSI, a
not-for-profit 501(c)(3) educational institution, is the largest science
center in the southeastern United States and home of the only IMAX* Dome
Theatre in the state of Florida.  In all, MOSI offers more than 450
"minds-on" interactive activities.  MOSI is located at 4801 East Fowler
Avenue, Tampa, opens daily at 9 a.m., is wheelchair accessible, and offers
free parking.  For more information, visit MOSI's Web site at www.mosi.org

Unfortunately, it has been the strategy of some interest groups to “Legislate” through the Constitutional Amendment process. 

 

The impacts on fine institutions like Stetson & others are the consequence of this simplistic answer to difficult issues. I support the Governor’s effort to deal with “unfunded” mandates from the public like: Class size, Pre-school & High Speed Rail.

 

I suggest that you make your appeals to those that can help put these Amendments back for “reconsideration” to the public, now that they can weigh the costs of supporting these issues.

Dear Stetson University alumni,

Once again, a move is under way in the Florida Legislature to cut the Florida Resident Access Grant (FRAG), this time by 10 percent.  Compared to its funding three years ago, such a cut would mean a loss of more than $1,500 to each student over a four-year career.

This grant is very important to the vast majority of Stetson University students. Nearly 73 percent of our students last fall were eligible for FRAG support, and it covers nearly 10 percent of their total costs. Many of our students tell us that without this help, they would not be able to continue their Stetson education.

Three circumstances make the FRAG threat critical:
* This is the tightest budget year in recent memory, with the Governor and Legislature looking to slash budgets and even eliminate entire programs and agencies.
* A substantial number of legislators are new and have never heard of the FRAG and don't know its importance to our students.
* Our number one supporter, the individual who helped us get the largest ever increase in the FRAG in 2000, passed away suddenly several weeks ago.

We need your help.  Please contact your legislators in the next 48 hours to let them know how you feel.  The best way to influence legislators is to take a brief handwritten (or typed) note to their district offices.  That will do more to get their attention, and potentially their support, than anything else you can do.  We realize that this may be inconvenient, but it is important. For some of our students a substantial cut in the FRAG would mean withdrawal from Stetson.

If you cannot get to the office, please rush your note by U.S. Mail (or UPS, FEDEX, etc.).  Please do not send an e-mail, as that is not as effective a way of getting your message across.

Tell them why the FRAG is or has been important to you.  Urge them to fight any and every attempt to cut the FRAG.   Remind them that the legislature promised a $3,000 FRAG eight years ago and remind them that there has already been a reduction.

If you are a student and would enroll in one of the state’s public universities without the FRAG, tell them that.  We've told legislators that a $2,651 FRAG is a much better investment than the $7,500 per-student-subsidy they spend for public students. But many legislators don’t believe our students would attend public colleges if the FRAG were eliminated, so they don’t think we’re saving the state almost $5,000 a year per student!

If you are a student and plan to go into teaching or the medical field in Florida after graduating, let them know that.  We’re proud of the contribution Stetson and other independent institutions are making to help overcome the critical teaching and health care worker shortages.

Remember to include your address and phone number in case they want to contact you.

To find your legislator’s office, go to http://SaveOurFRAG.org/alert.htm and select the legislator whose district office is closest to you.  Depending on where you live, it may be a significant distance away (for instance, if you live in Pensacola, the closest legislator is in Fort Walton Beach).  But choose the closest legislator and, if possible, take your note to his or her office. If you live in a large metro area, you may find that two or more legislators are relatively close to you.  Please consider taking notes to all of them to help make up for those who don’t help.

Whatever you do will make a difference.  In previous years, legislators have let us know that contacts by our students, faculty, staff, alumni and families made the crucial difference in their decision to support the FRAG.

Will you help one more time? 

Would you also fax a copy of your note and any response you get to Save Our FRAG? You can fax it to 850-681-0057 or send an e-mail copy to SaveOurFRAG@ <http://SaveOurFRAG@bellsouth.net/> bellsouth.net <http://SaveOurFRAG@bellsouth.net/> .   And thank you in advance for your willingness to help Save Our FRAG!

Sincerely yours,


Doug Lee, president

Please be advised that the views expressed by Mr. Black in no way represent my views or those of the City leadership.  In fact, the City of Miami has and will continue to work very closely with the team led by Ambassador Cobb.  Any suggestions to the contrary are disturbing.  While we welcome and encourage the help of Mr. Black and others, it is also absurd to suggest that the first time Commissioner Winton and I became aware of the FTAA was during August, 2002.

Dear Mr. Black:

 

The Governor has asked me to respond to your email of February 22 regarding your interest in helping Miami secure the FTAA Secretariat.  

 

As you might know, we have created a prestigious Advisory Board for Florida FTAA and, given your extensive experiences, we would like to include you on that Advisory Board.  Enclosed is a list of the members of the Advisory Board.

 

In addition, we have a Board of Trustees made up of distinguished Floridians that have each made a contribution of $10,000.  If you would be interested in making a $10,000 contribution we would like to discuss with you the possibility of you being on the Board of Trustees of the Florida FTAA.  

 

The only statement in your email to the Governor with which I would take great exception is your statement regarding the City of Miami’s participation in the Ministerial and ABF where you state “…the City of Miami has little participation in this process…”  This is not an accurate statement as the city of Miami is intimately involved in both hosting the Ministerial this November and in helping us secure the Secretariat.  Mayor Manny Diaz, Commissioner Johnny Winton and City Manager Joe Arriola are all active board members, chairmen of committees and intimately involved with all the affairs of Florida FTAA and the Trade Ministerial and ABF.   We are making great progress in large part due to the superb contributions of Mayor Diaz, Commissioner Winton and City Manager Arriola.

 

Let us know whether you would like to serve on our Advisory Board or Board of Trustees, as we would very much like the benefit of your extensive experience.

 

Chuck Cobb

February 22, 2003

Dear Governor Bush, 

I am writing you regarding Florida's campaign to secure the site of the Permanent Secretariat of the Free Trade Area of the Americas.  When you spoke in Miami at the end of January, I listened carefully to your plans and ideas for the campaign.

In August of 2002, I briefed Commissioner Johnny Winton and Mayor Diaz of the City of Miami on the FTAA structure and the benefits to the City of being selected as the site of the Permanent Secretariat.  Prior to that time, city officials were not familiar with the concept.  In September, I was engaged as a consultant by the City to work with federal and international agencies in Washington and with governments in the Hemisphere to promote Miami's candidacy.

Originally from Texas, I worked for 21 years for Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, where I was in charge of international programs.  In 1980, joined the Organization of American States in Washington, first as Deputy Director of the Regional Program for Scientific and Technological Development, then as Advisor to the Secretary General for External Relations, dealing with European and Middle Eastern countries holding Permanent Observer Status to the OAS.  In 1987, I was named Chief of Mission and Representative to the United States for the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA), a specialized agency for the OAS dealing with agricultural development in the Hemisphere.  In this position, as Chief of Mission I held the equivalent rank of Ambassador.  I speak Spanish, Portuguese and French.

In my 17 years with the OAS, I worked extensively with Ministries of Foreign Relations and Trade throughout the Hemisphere, and maintain friendships with many leaders in government in countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.

I initiated contacts for the City with the office of the U.S. Trade Representative in Washington, and met with officials of the OAS and Inter-American Development Bank there,  as well as with representatives of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, both at its headquarters in Chile and in Washington.  These three agencies compose the tri-partite committee of  FTAA, which is charged with administrative and financial responsibility for FTAA meetings.

I am married to a Chilean, who was a specialist for 20 years in the Department of Cultural Affairs in the OAS, responsible for programs on national cultural patrimony.  As probably in your home, our conversation is a mixture of Spanish and English.  We live in Coconut Grove. 

In your address in January, I noted with appreciation your commitment to meeting personally with leaders throughout the Hemisphere to promote the case for Miami.  In Chile in December, I met with representatives of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and International Trade and received a warm reaction to the idea of Miami as the site of the Permanent Secretariat.

You have already made important appointments to the team for the Ministerial and AFB meetings in Miami in November.  At this point, the City of Miami has little participation in this process, which may be purposeful.  Nevertheless, I believe that, with my years of experience and contacts, I could prove useful to you and the campaign between now and the time the decision will be made, hopefully by consensus rather than by election.

When you are in Miami, I would welcome the opportunity to exchange ideas with you regarding the lobbying campaign you plan and to offer my support.  My telephone is 305/774-1005.  I look forward to hearing from you soon. Sincerely, David Black

Mr. Governor,

Needless to say, your call came as a bit of a surprise this morning...a pleasant one, but a
surprise nonetheless.   I was walking to work in the newly fallen snow after dealing with a dead
car battery, challenges that I will hopefully avoid in Tallahassee!

So your call brightened an otherwise dreary morning.  It was an honor.

I hope I did not put Secretary Agwanobi in an awkward position, as it was obvious that his
staff had not had time to relay my phone calls of last evening to him or yourself.  I spoke to
the HR director and incumbent Communications Director last night around 8:00 p.m.

I have nothing but respect for the Doctor and the great work his staff does for Florida at DOH.
 I spent the day there last Friday and it was very obvious to me that they were a motivated,
happy, and energized staff who believes in what they do and in their boss.  To an outsider with
an eye for fabrication, it was obvious that their "spark" was genuine.

As I said, the fit for me at State is better and I am pleased to be joining Secretary Hood's
team on June 16th.  

I will bring the family by during the March 5-7 time frame for a courtesy call.  I will work
with my chief-of-staff at DOS to see if there's a five-minute window in your schedule that week.
 

I am being completely and totally honest when I say that the #1 dream job on my career
transition plan was a spot on your team, sir.  After a 20-year career in the Navy, the thing I
feared I'd miss the most was being part of something larger than myself and the sense of noble
purpose.  This job at DOS gives me all that, and more.  

At the end of the day, I judge myself on one yardstick: Was I of any service to others today? 
I know I'll be able to say "yes" working in your administration.  You will not find another
person with more "fire in their belly" than me, sir.

I look forward to meeting you.

Very respectfully,

 <http://www.beaconcouncil.com/> The Beacon Council 

Governor. I was pleased to read in today's Miami Herald that John Delaney may be considered for appointment as Lt. Governor.Let me put my two cents in regarding the potential appointment of John Delaney to the post of Lieutenant Governor. I have known John for almost 12 years now, and worked with him in my capacity as Deputy Mayor in Ed Austin's administration, then Senior Economic Advisor in his own mayoral administration. I believe strongly that John would be a terrific addition to your administration.

John's intelligence, creativity and energy, especially in the area of economic development, have been quite beneficial to Jacksonville. His leadership was vital in forging the River City Renaissance program during Mayor Austin's administration. I also worked through many hours alongside John in crafting the agreement that ultimately made the Jacksonville Jaguars a reality. I was impressed by his attention to detail in creating neighborhood improvement programs, early in his own administration. Those programs benefited all neighborhoods throughout Jacksonville. 

All this culminated in, what I believe is, his crowning achievement, the Better Jacksonville Plan. This plan best demonstrates, in tangible terms, John's integrity, commitment to economic growth, sensitivity to environmental concerns, and dedication to insuring that all areas of Jacksonville benefit from his policies.

I believe John would be a great asset to you in the challenges you face regarding Florida's economic growth and development. These are trying times, as you well know. John would be a great "go to" person for you in implementing and executing your policies in a variety of areas, including economic development.

Of course, you know John well. You also know the qualities you seek in a Lieutenant Governor. Choosing the best candidate is difficult at best. I do not envy your position. My recommendation is for Mayor John Delaney for all he can do to benefit your administration.and  most importantly the people of Florida.

Sincerely,

Frank R. Nero

Jeb. I just saw the story in today's Herald about the possible selection
of Gaston Cantens as Lieutenant Governor. I could not think of a better
choice.
   I have known Gaston for over 20 years. I have seen him forego
lucrative financial arrangemnents that he thought might be inappropriate
to public office. I have een him make career decisions that some might
say short-shrifted his family financially because he thought they were
right
    Gaston is a guy who understand the personal commitment to morality
and integrity. He is a man who understands at the end of the day that
the test of what it is to be a man is the willingness to have your
family know about it.
   He is a unique and honorable person. He has a steady moral compass.
He is a religious person who lives his faith.
    Professionally, he is an excellent lawyer, and a skilled, highly
intelligent (praise that I toss around very carefully) public official.
He has made a big difference in soutth florida politics. He has made a
big difference and has been an enormous help is our efforts for the FTAA
and trade in South Florida.
    Finally, he is a team player and as loyal as the day is long. I have
been a long-time fan of Frank Brogan. I believe that Gaston will be a
man in Frank's mold but one who brings unique skills and perspectives to
the job. Someone that you can trust to do the job and to always be
guided by the fact that the team's leader must be the focal point of the
team, and that his success is the best pat on the back for a Lieutenant
Governor.
  Good luck in your choice process, but it would be hard to trump this
guy. Joe. PS. If he stays out of the sun, he can pretty much pass for
white.

Bush rightly absolved the taxpayers.

Then, a lone businessman in Central Florida financed a 2000 constitutional amendment to shove the same concept on us. voters. What a minority of Floridians who vote thus approved in a "majority" vote was high-speed rail with the ability to reach -- but not be mandated to travel at -- 120 mph.

In an in-depth policy paper I researched and authored two years ago for a client, the James Madison Institute in Tallahassee, I coined the phrase "Florida's Perpendicular Amtrak" to describe the current high-speed rail project... that could be all we get! Not exactly a bargain, much less a good use of Florida's transportation money.

Bottom line -- this project should be off track by now. Every elected official at every level in Florida should have its demise on their his or her Top 10 lists. Their tax millage rates and budgets are at risk, directly or indirectly. A slew of freshmen state legislators (thanks due to term limits) need to rise up and lead us to a principled, smart decision without undue influence. This is especially not an economic era to be fooling around in with so much money to for a singular, extravagant purchase, tying up piles of tax money for 20 or more years to come.

While there's speed gathering to fight the project -- or at least return it to the ballot -- let's be honest by dropping the "bullet train" references. And before we take the next train that comes along, beware, voters: When policy decisions are allowed to be written into the Florida Constitution by ballot initiative, it's taking the easy and inappropriate way out of these messes. "Sending a message" that way is a guaranteed trip to higher taxes, a personal or corporate state income tax, and/or bludgeoned services. Put a little muscle into it and lean on your state legislator and elected officials to right these policy wrongs instead.

Dear Governor Bush,

 

We folks out here trust you a lot and believe you have the state’s best interest at heart when you make decisions. We are praying long and hard that you not give Glenda Hood any more power than you already have. In my opinion, she is not someone the pro-life community would want to see as your Lt Governor. Especially as it might mean she would someday run for Governor on the Republican ticket.

Have you ever asked yourself, why do the Florida Veterans here in Florida have so much trouble in getting their claims resolved in a correct manner and a reasonable time, the below may answer your questions. The Veterans of Florida Need Help. How about it Tallahassee, are you going to continue to let this happen or you going to join us Florida Veterans fight the fight to get a 2nd honest claims office and clean up the one we now have, remember, these are the Veterans and now the young ones of the today's Military that will be coming home facing the same problems we now face in St. Petersburg that you represent. PLEASE DON'T LET THIS TO CONTINUE.

Regional Office of the Department of Veterans Affairs in St. Petersburg, Florida.

  <http://www.vetsforjustice.com/Regional%20Office.jpg> 

This Regional Office has almost been a regular on 60 minutes, there have been so many stories about it's Official Policy of falsifying the material facts, in Veterans Claim files. All as part of an ongoing illegal scheme to cheat America's Veterans.

To get a small idea of the massive, ongoing, corruption in this Regional Office click on the artists opinion below, of what the Regional Director of the St. Petersburg V.A. should look like, given his hostile, illegal, conduct towards America's Veterans.

 <http://www.sptimes.com/News/080100/TampaBay/VA_office_targeted_fo.shtml> Click Here Click Here

As you can see, while 20,000 real Veterans wait for their claims to be processed, VA Employees are pushing through Phony claims for each other, In As Little As FIVE DAYS!

While the Regional Director's Office, blatantly lies to the newspapers claiming that ONLY the most complex claims take slightly more then 200 days to process. With so much national, and local, news media constantly exposing the massive ongoing corruption in this Regional Office, and with there being some twenty thousand (20,000) victims, waiting for their claims to be process it makes you ask ;

"Where is the law!"

Where are the FBI and United States Attorney?

Clearly it is a violation of federal law pursuant to Title 18 Section 1001(a)(1),(2), and (3) to falsify or cover up material facts on the paperwork of Veterans Claims punishable by five (5) years in federal prison.

Yet, the St. Petersburg Regional Office freely violates Title 18 Section 1001 on almost every Veterans case. And nothing is done. It is time the FBI and U.S. Attorney explain to the public why?

At any rate, the Regional Office of the VA in St. Petersburg, Florida has an Official Policy to falsify, conceal, and cover up material facts in Veterans Claim Files, and to send Veterans in endless circles with their con games.

To use any trickery, no matter how illegal, or dishonest, to knowingly cheat Veterans.

The St. Petersburg Florida Regional VA Office is the most corrupt of the corrupt, and has earned, and deserves, to be in our Hall of Shame.

It is our hope that the United States Attorney in Tampa, Will do a FULL Investigation of that Extremely Corrupt Government Office.

Re:  Maryam Ghyabi - St. John's River Water Management District Board 
       
Dear Governor Bush:

Once again I am writing to you regarding a recommendation to a position
where I deem my endorsement is extremely important.  The difference in this
particular case is that this recommendation is personal because Maryam
Ghyabi is my sister.  As you will see from the enclosed resume and
distinctive list of relevant experience, Maryam Ghyabi brings with her a
wealth of knowledge and an extraordinary background which makes her an
exceptional candidate.

Maryam has long since been serving her community and the greater central
Florida areas, and has earned the respect and admiration of her peers and
our area citizens due to her intuitive understanding of all the issues
surrounding planned growth and development.  She has received many awards
and wide recognition for her countless contributions to her community and
she has always assumed a huge sense of responsibility surrounding her duties
as a citizen and a professional who can make a profound difference by her
service and commitment to the preservation of sound growth standards.
Equipped with the experience earned from having worked for a wide spectrum
of government platforms, including many different cities and municipalities,
Maryam can act from every vantage point and conduct her duties very
objectively based upon such broad exposure.  

Governor, I trust you will give Maryam Ghyabi every possible consideration
for the position to the Board of the St. John's River Water Management
District.  She will serve her state proudly bringing to this post enormous
talent, experience, knowledge and dedication to excellence.  Please do not
hesitate to contact me should you require any further information.  

Sincerely,

Jeb,

Ruth and I are back in Estero - thanks for providing the warm weather! I
hope that you and your family are doing well.

The News Press stated this morning that Lee County needs to build 58 new
schools in the next 10 years.

I have become associated with Workstage, an incredible company owned by
Steelcase and The Gayle Company with Morgan Stanley financing. Workstage
has
an excellent school building product. They have just completed 7 schools
in
Detroit in a short time frame at major cost savings over traditional
building methods.

I would appreciate it if you could provide me with a good contact in Lee
County so we could present the concept. It further appears to me that
the
Lee County need is probably replicated in other Counties. I truly
believe
that the State of Florida could reap enormous benefits with the
Workstage
system.

i look forward to hearing from you.

Peace,
Bill

St. John's Episcopal Church is having a Blessing and Commissioning of the Servants of God in Civil Authority on Tuesday, March 4, 2003, at 8:00am.  This was done at the request of Speaker Johnnie Byrd and both he and President Jim King will be reading.  We have invited the Governor and Cabinet, the Legislature, the Court, and both city and county governments.  Please join us in this beautiful service to His honor and His glory.  Who says we can not mix government and religion!
       For those of you unaccustomed to the high Anglican form of worship, it should be a real experience.  I look forward to worshipping with you, and ask that you invite anyone you can.  Bring a member, staffer or lobbyist there with you.  God Bless!

Dear Dr. John Agwunobi,  I submit this electronic communication for clarity and directions. 

Under the Florida Model Jail Standards will you please advise me to what recourse is available if any of these standards are violated? 

I have a keen concern with regard to the inmates who are diagnosed with HIV/AIDS being discharged from the jails and not receiving the required (3) supply of HIV/AIDS medications upon discharge.  Rather, some of these inmate are asked to wait and  return in 24 hours despite where they live and report to (1) location only, others just have to wait sometimes past 11 days to receive their medications, and this is based on information recieved by the Fort Lauderdale Branch NAACP. 

Therefore, I am personally investigating this information with a sincere concerns to the safety, health and welfare of these individuals. I am seeking directions from you and your department in providing me with the written requirements under the Florida Model Jail Standards, provide me with the section under Florida law which enforces the standards and compliance when and if identified for being violated, and lastly, identify and provide me with the section under FS. 499 that allows jails/facilaties to disburse, dispense, and/or distribute medications and each location without a pharmacy permit or license. 

I sincerely appreciate your immediate response.

Rotary International SW Florida District conference May 9th or 10th.  The 
district encompasses everything south of Tampa and east to Clewiston and is 
being held in Naples at the Beach Club Hotel and Golf Club.    

We have Luis Cosenza, V-Pres. of Honduras speaking on Saturday.  Luis is a 
client of mine and willing to speak at any of the time slots we want.  
According to Luis, you have established a good friendship with the current 
President.  Luis as you know will probably be their next President.

You can speak at dinner Friday or Saturday, or breakfast or lunch on 
Saturday.  Needless to say the majority of the crowd is Republican.  
Unfortunately we would need a commitment understanding emergencies do happen 
by the middle of April. 

The dinners will have about 600 in attendance with about 350 for the 
breakfast and lunch.  I look forward to hearing from you and best of luck in 
the upcoming legislative session.

Governor,

I would just like to add my name as a strong supporter of Tom Johnson, who is seeking nomination to the First Circuit Judicial seat, formerly occupied by Kenneth Bell.  As a native Pensacolian, I have known both judges, and think Tom would mirror the work Ken has left behind.

Kindest regards,

Governor,
All good questions...and a primary purpose of mine is to help you succeed as our state's CEO.
The marketing program is one of several strategic recommendations that we were planning to discuss on Monday inasmuch as it positions Florida in the minds of decision makers once the recovery picks up momentum-- and now is the time to do that positioning if we can find the resources.
Business environment--as you have frequently pointed out-- is key, but that fact has to be introduced and frequently reinforced;  i.e., one of the purposes of our current campaign.
Our reserve does indeed need to be rebuilt in light of the trust-fund shortfall, but we need to create a compelling vision to garner increased private-sector support. Again, our marketing efforts help do this. With your help we've created excitement in our program both within and outside Florida. We just need to keep making the point that: FLORIDA IS THE INNOVATION HUB OF THE AMERICAS.
As concerns the grant account question, I will have that resolved by October of this year. I'll cover the details with you later.
Finally, until you are entirely comfortable with the issue (marketing), I do not plan to discuss as part of our recommendations on Monday.
 
Thank you for responding....
 
 
Darrell 
 
P.S. Sorry for the delay in responding, but I've been with a prospect since breakfast.

Good afternoon, Governor... 

I look forward to the Economic Summit on Monday and am finalizing some recommendations for you this week.  I think you'll appreciate the proactive approach we've taken and the strategies we've developed to help sustain and grow Florida's economy even in the event of armed conflict.  

One of those strategies is to fine-tune our marketing efforts to showcase Florida's strengths as they relate to national imperatives, particularly homeland security.  However, given the fact that we didn't have a chance to discuss funding for the Team Florida Marketing Campaign during our trip last week, I wanted to run this by you before the summit.  I am prepared to discuss the marketing efforts as they relate to these new strategies -- as well as discuss a price-tag -- but only if you are comfortable with me doing this.

I am attaching a one-pager on the campaign that I intended to use in our discussion in Spain.  If I can leave you with one thought, it is that the plan includes much more than advertising ... it's strategic direct marketing and national media relations as well.  We have a tremendous product to sell -- thanks in no small part to your leadership -- and we want to promote that product to companies around the globe.

Thanks for your feedback, and whatever you decide is fine with me. 

Regards, 

Darrell

Dear Governor Bush:  I had my meeting yesterday with Caity's teacher, ESE teacher, ESE staffing specialist, speech teacher and the class intern.  I had my list of the new accommodations that had been approved and I do believe Caity will be given the best possible tools to help her succeed. We went over the list and her latest accomplishments and she has had FCAT practice reviews and I know that everyone on her IEP team wants to see her succeed.  Whatever the outcome, I at least know that everything that could possibly have been done has been done and I thank you for taking the Blue Ribbon Task force recommendations seriously.  I know you will be hearing and have heard a great deal of negative viewpoints, especially during this time of testing, but I also believe that after yesterday's meeting because of accountability, there has been much more of an effort to help my child succeed,  and I think that is very good for her future and for the future of many of the children like Caity.  Last night we read one of her stories in her reading book about the Pilgrims and their hardships.  The FCAT question at the end was "what tools and machinery do you think the pilgrims would like to have had that we have today?".  First she said "a hammer" I told her they had hammers, then she said "a saw" I told her they had saws, but not electric saws, then she threw up her arms and said "the amazing Omega 3000".  I think thats a vacum cleaner, but it was amusing.... thanks for listening......marianne and Caity bryant

To the Honorable Governor Jeb Bush,

I would like to begin by applauding you for the many positive changes
that you have implemented since becoming our governor.  FCAT testing and
better accountability from state funded agencies makes perfect sense.

I thank you for supporting substance abuse programs in the Florida
Department of Corrections prison system.  I have no issue with your
implementation of  laws that are tough on crimes.  What I do hope you
will take a hard look at is the issue of educational and training
opportunities for inmates incarcerated in our state.  

Inmates that are released without having had appropriate intervention
services are destined to recidivate.  It is so much easier for an inmate
to earn a diploma or gain a skill while they are incarcerated.  When
they are released they have so many other issues to deal with.  Survival
is the word.  Please consider a way in which services can be provided
within the institution walls.  Our  regional WIB's could begin to
provide services prior to an inmates release.  There are many
alternatives.  

You funded Transition Assistance Specialist positions a few years ago. 
Please do not cut them from your budget .  They provide such vital
information for the transitioning offender.  Instead of cutting these
positions we need to have counterpart positions in each workforce region
so that there is a continued link on the outside for the offender .

I know that you are faced with incredible funding shortages,  my
prayers are with you as you try to discern what to fund and what to
cut.

My sister was murdered a year and a half ago, stabbed 94 times by an
ex-offender that needed help.  Perhaps if there had been a better
transition system in place this could have been prevented, perhaps not. 
I only hope that you will consider the incredible need that exists for
so many within our prison system and provide the opportunity for them to
improve themselves and become productive, law abiding citizens . In so
doing  you will be helping to lower the crime within our state and
lowering the extremely high cost of incarceration.  

Sincerely,

It was great chatting with you briefly today before our presentations at the City Cares National Conference Opening Plenary here in Miami.    
 
As requested, I am following-up on having my art hang in your office.  I'd like to get a sense from you as to what would make most sense.  I can have some of my existing pieces exhibited and loaned for the remainder of your term, or I can create a Florida-specific painting or mural to hang permanently. 
 
Actually, it would be cool to create a mural much like the one on the stage today, where we would collage messages on the background.  The mural could be entitled "My Florida," capturing the state-wide stories and voices about Floridians love most about their state.  
 
Please let me know what you think, and how to proceed.
 
Thanks,

I’m forwarding you a copy of a letter that one of my Miami associates, Steve Brodie, mailed to Phil Bond at the U.S. Department of Commerce. Isaac Serure’s problem to date has not been remedied.
 
In Tampa, I know of a chemical company experiencing a similar business problem in Peru.   It would be helpful if Enterprise Florida or some government agency could look into the matter to determine if this is a pattern of Peruvian business behavior.  If there is a problem, perhaps the findings can be of help to businesses with Peruvian problems and to companies planning to do business there.
 
A participant in your trade mission to Spain told me that you did a fantastic job and the scheduled activities were excellent.
 
Good luck on the upcoming legislative session.  I know it’s tough.

Phil Bond
Chief of Staff

14th Constitution Avenue, N.W.

VIA E-MAIL

 
 
Dear Mr. Bond:
 
            I like to thank you for taking the time to talk with my partner, Governor Bob Martinez.  As Governor Martinez discussed, our client Isaac Serure is facing some challenging and unfair treatment in Peru.  Pursuant to your request, we are providing you with this letter which addresses some of these issues.  Further, if possible, we would appreciate if you could schedule a meeting for Mr. Serure to meet with the U.S. Secretary of Commerce during his trip to Peru.
 
            Mr. Serure is a U.S. citizen who resides in Miami, Florida.  Mr. Serure is a businessman who has spent a great deal of my time promoting business throughout the Caribbean basin and Latin America.  As a businessman in South Florida he understood a number of years ago that South Florida would serve as the gateway for business between the United States and Latin America.  As such, he was one of the pioneer businessman who traveled to Latin American countries and tried to identify business opportunities.  Mr. Serure always operated under the belief, that it was in the best interest of the U.S. and the foreign countries for Americans to invest in these countries.  
 
            Mr. Serure is actively involved with businesses throughout Peru and Brazil and, has been active with the respective Chambers of Commerce to promote trade and business between the U.S. and these countries.  However, he has recently experienced and has heard from other U.S. businesspersons that there is a lack of equality of how these foreign governments and their judicial systems treat U.S. businesspersons.  While Mr. Serure hates to claim that Americans are discriminated against in these foreign countries, it is clear that they are not being treated fairly.  
 
            In particular, Isaac Serure as a trustee for various business enterprises has had many problems with both the business community and judicial system in Peru.  There are currently several cases in the Peruvian court system that are being curtailed solely due to the case involving a foreigner.  The following are just a few examples of some of the problems which confront Mr. Serure.
 
1.	Funds were loaned to a real estate developer. Notes were signed by the appropriate parties. The notes came due and the borrower defaulted. The borrower then refused to pay the notes. The borrower is currently being sued. Their defense is that the notes were paid. The lender asks only to show proof that the loans were paid (i.e. check, wire transfer, etc.). Nothing has been forthcoming. The courts have done nothing to assist in this matter. The courts are constantly delaying in making any rulings. An accountant was hired by the borrower, to prove their case, and he said that the loans were repaid. However, when proof of the loan payoff was requested, again, no proof was shown. This case is still in the courts. 
 
2.	In another instance homes were built with investors funds (project 1). The developer charged costs from another real estate project (project 2), that was being built, to project 1. An accounting showed that some of the costs of project 2 were charged to project 1. When the developer was confronted with the proof he denied the allegations and had the accountant who prepared the analysis deny that he prepared the worksheets showing the fraud. A hand writing expert was hired. The expert states unequivocally that the spreadsheets were prepared and signed by the accountant. A fingerprint was also taken from the spreadsheets that proved to be that of the accountant. This case is still before the courts. 
 
            It appears that corruption is effecting remedies available to U.S. businesspersons.  If the United States determines that it is in our best interest to promote business in those countries, then the U.S. government should develop treaties and such other means that ensure U.S. investors will be treated fairly and honestly. 
 
            It is our understanding, that the U.S. Secretary of Commerce is in Peru and that one of the primary purposes of the Secretary’s trip is to address these exact issues.  Since, Mr. Serure has been involved in this region for such a long period of time, it may be beneficial if the U.S. Secretary of Commerce would have the opportunity to learn first hand of some of the obstacles faced by U.S. investors.  Accordingly, it would be greatly appreciated if you could either arrange a meeting for Mr. Serure with the Secretary in Peru, or at least, arrange an opportunity for him to speak by telephone.  Mr. Serure is 


presently in Peru and can be reached at his home number 4214-406, or his cell phone number is 870-5039.  
 
            Mr. Serure strongly believes that in order for the Secretary’s trip to be as successful as everyone would like, having the Secretary learn of actual events can only assist him when he addresses these issues to the government of Peru.
 
            Once again, I thank you for making the time to discuss this matter with Governor Martinez.  Looking forward to hearing from you .  Thanks again.
 
Cordially,

Hi Jeb,
 
I was wondering if it would be possible to meet with you at your convenience to discuss the national Do-Not-Call registry?  I have had meetings with the FTC including one of the Commissioners and while I find the agency to be comprised of some outstanding individuals, I find their flagrant lack of concern for improving the lives of most Americans within the scope of this issue to be very troubling and stunning.
 
In summary, I came up with a plan that would enable the FTC to license my company's phone number, 1-800-Do-Not-Call, at no cost to the government.  This number is significant because a Wharton Study showed that 25-50 million more Americans will sign up for the registry if 1-800-Do-Not-Call becomes the number used for registering.  Even so, the FTC seems to be only interested in satisfying the concerns of the telemarketing industry, and in particular Jim Miller - a great conservative and the mentor of the current Chairman, by minimizing consumer participation in the registry.
 
As you may recall, I'm a pilot in the Navy Reserves and I'll be retiring this Saturday.  It would be a great reward for 20 years of service to be able to sit down with you and discuss this issue.
 
Warm regards,
 
Ken Underwood

Subject: Date for CETA


Governor:

DOE Secretary Spencer Abraham's office has informed us that they are
available to come to Miami pending your selection of a date for the
Secretary to join you to launch FIU's new Center for Energy and
Technology of the America's (CETA).

Knowing of the impending legislative session, either March 28 or April 4
would be ideal; however, we would welcome any date which you and the
Secretary can coordinate.  We are advised that he is ready to be
positively responsive should your office contact him.

We have received strong industry interest in this event and expect
substantial representation by Congressional Delegation, presidents and
CEO's of energy companies, bankers and energy investors, federal
contractors, international and academic stakeholders, and many more.

President Bush's national security strategy, released in September,
aimed to "enhance energy security" by having the United States work with
allies to "expand the sources and types of global energy supplied,
especially in the Western Hemisphere, Africa, Central Asia and the
Caspian region."

CETA's mission is to encourage the increased production of indigenous
energy supplies and the more efficient use of energy throughout the
Western Hemisphere and to promote cooperation among countries, leading
to increased energy security and quality of life in the region.  CETA
will accomplish these goals by conducting applied research, policy
analysis, technology development and transfer and professional training.

We are eager to work with you to publicly launch this heralded new
initiative.

Mitch

I am writing to you regarding a family that is being destroyed, to see if there is anything you can do to help.  My friend, Christine Stanley, and her family are in dire need of help.  She is in the St. Johns County Jail right now, and the charge is child abuse.  Let me start by saying something you may not want to hear.  Children and Family Services is the worst organization since the KKK.  I have worked in family law in Jacksonville for the last 17 years, and have seen them in action.  When they were called HRS, they were known in legal circles as the Home 'Recking Society."  The idea that they put families back together is laughable.  Christine has a teenage daughter who is and has been out of control.  Christine is trying to save her daughter.  She even sent her to a "boot camp" place to try to reform her.  Unless you have ever had the experience of an out of control teen, you cannot imagine what it is like to go through it.  My son is 30 now, but when he was a young teen, he got into drugs, and I had to sleep with my door locked because I was afraid of him.  It is not an easy thing.  Anyhow, Christine slapped her daughter and maybe she should not have done that, but what would your reaction be to a daughter who just told you that when you and your 4 year old son go to sleep, she plans to kill you both?  It was an emotional reaction, not an attempt to injure her child.  But teens today know how to use the system to "get even" with parents who don't allow them to do what they want to do.  The problem is that the organizations of the state WANT to believe the child.  In fact, they can be downright obsessed with it.  So they take Christine's daughter and put her in a foster home?  No!  They put her with a lady who has herself been accused of child abuse and also of drug use.  And while with this lady, the teenager has had sex with an adult male.  Has the court removed the child from this home?  No.  They have managed to get Christine found guilty of child abuse.  Now her little 4 year old is being deprived of his mother and crying every night for her.  What earthly good is that?  I have known Christine professionally and personally.  I have seen her with her son, although I've never seen her daughter.  She is a fine mother and a fine woman.  This should not be happening to her.  If you can help her at all, I beg you to do so.  I know personally about Children and Family Services from when it was HRS.  I put my son in Camp Tracy back then, when he was about 13 and totally out of control.  He did well there (actually went to school and behaved himself) until he and another boy ran away, went to the first police car they found, and said they'd been abused.  Well, that was the end of my involvement in my child's life.  Although I was not acused of anything, my child was taken from me and put in the home of the other boy he ran away with.  I had no money for an attorney, so I was helpless.  They sent him to his father in West Virginia, where he ended up placed in another facility and he just slipped through the cracks because he didn't get the emotional counseling he needed.  It took many years for him to get where he is today.  Christine's family needs her and her daughter needs the right kind of help.  She won't get it if her mother is in jail and she is with a woman who just wants the social security checks she receives from her father's death.  This is a complicated case, but jail for Christine is not an answer to anything.  Please help her.
Thank you for your time and attention.

Subject:	2/27 School Board update

2/24 I met with Tony Iorio who is head of Poinciana development and serves as Vice Chairman of Kissimmee/Osceola Chamber of Commerce Education committee. We talked about School Match, parental involvement and test scores. Tony will be a great partner in this role & I look forward to working with him. At 4:00 PM the entire School Board met for a presentation on Superintendent Goals and for a presentation by our legal team. The topics covered started with PR/Community relations. Dana Schafer did a great job. Her dept. gets only 39K from the District and another 77K in grant money. Christi Sessions is in Dana's department and has recently become gravely ill and is hospitalized, please put Christi in your prayers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Next came a presentation on legal services. Our legal services are outsourced. For everything we pay 650K yearly. Since being sworn in I have developed great confidence and respect for our legal representation. While 650K is a lot of money, it is money well spent. Over the years I have learned you get what you pay for when it comes to attorney's. Out of prudence the Board has agreed to work with the law firm to see if these fees can be reduced. Fellow Board member John McKay has volunteered to represent the Board in working on this. In my opinion the Attorney's are one of the areas that works exceptionally well within the District. All of us will be very interested to see what comes from our looksee at cutting costs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Finally the Superintendent presented a new Org. Chart. The significant changes are to have the CFO report directly to the Superintendent. Hire a staff Architect and an additional project Mgr in the facility dept. Adding another Deputy Superintendent that will have all the Principals and two Assistant Superintendents report to that position. Fellow Board member Thomas Chalifoux and I voiced our concerns with only having one person in this position. This person would have 42 direct reports. I suggested having two, possibly dividing responsibilities by geography (east/west). Having forty two top administrators report to one person is way to many direct reports and not a best management practice.                                                                                                                                                                                                         2/25 I began my day in a meeting with County Commissioner Ken Shipley, Associate Superintendent for facilities planning and construction John Davis, and State Representative John Quinones legislative aide Rosa Alvarez-Demblewski (Rosa also is on the education facility task force committee). We met with a developer in Celebration who uses a software package that identifies all aspects of land use, demographics, and RE transactions. Since our meeting John Davis has directed Harry Fix to call this developer to see the software and Commissioner Shipley has instructed County staff to contact this firm. Later that afternoon I met with the Superintendent to work to a plan for parental involvement. So far the volunteer (OASIS) dept. has began developing a teacher training strategy relative to getting teachers comfortable having more parents in the Schools. Finally the entire Board had a Construction workshop. During the workshop our energy mgt vendor presented that the District is over 110 % towards the positive financially with our energy mgt plan. Also John Davis presented how residential home growth is affecting our Schools. The most critical Elementary need is to relieve Reedy Creek ES. Without the class size amendment that School will be at just under 400% capacity within 5 yrs. With the class size amendment that same School will be at over 700% capacity within 5 yrs. The Board also rejected a 120K reroof project of the student services bldg. The job itself was only 72K and the rest was fees-we are putting this out to bid. I credit David Stone, John McKay and Thomas Chalifoux for catching this. At times our collective experience and perspective really comes together and this is a good example of that.                                                                                                                                                                                                 2/26 I started my day with a meeting with an architect. Next I met with a Martin County School Board member and their Director of facilities in Stuart. They are doing a really neat joint use project with Indian River Community College. Later that day I met with the Head of facilities and construction for Palm Beach County Schools. They are looking at some alternative construction methods. Finally I finished my day at the Education facility task force meeting. Tom Lewis and his committee are doing a great job. Scheduling permitting I pan on attending these meetings regularly.                                                                                                                                                                                                             This AM I began my day in Orlando meeting with a Construction firm. Next I went to Central Ave ES and met with the Kitchen mgr. I taught Junior Achievement to Mrs. Bass's class. Today my class all wrote letters to a soldier serving in Kuwait. This is my way of teaching patriotism to the kids. Afterwards I met with Mrs. Rivers the Assistant Principal. For lunch I attended an Osceola Boys and Girls Club meeting. Commissioner Paul Owen got Boys and Girls Club kids 100 Astros tickets during Spring break week. We are lucky to have Paul Owen as our County Chairman. GREAT NEWS. The funding came though to start a new after School Boys and Girls Club program at Neptune Middle School, this is very exciting. Our Osceola Boys and Girls Club Dinner and Golf Tourney will be May 30-31. May 30 is dinner at Gaylord Palms, May 31 is Golf at Harmony.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Later I met with the firm building the Harmony HS. After that I went to the District facility dept. to rank construction firms for several new projects. OHS Principal Chuck Paradiso was also at the facility dept. to rank firms. We had a great conversation about many things ranging from School Based Mgt to FCAT's. Chuck does a great job and we are lucky to have him as our administrator at OHS. Later I went to my good friend State Representative John Quinones open house. While their I was interviewed by channel 13 about esol and FCAT legislation sponsored by RE. Quinones. Finally I attended the Osceola Republican Executive meeting where they gave me the honor of being the first recipient of their Osceola Republican Heroes award for my work on the School Board. My fellow Board member Thomas Chalifoux was present, and I recognized him when I spoke for being such a great guy to work with on the Board. As always your questions,issues and/or comments are welcome. Sincerely, Jay Wheeler-Osceola School Board-District One

Dear Jeb:

I couldn't help but think of you when I read the article in this week's
People magazine about Georgia Governer, Sonny Perdue's battle to slim down
his staff with the "Capitol Challenge".  I think Florida should challenge
his state!

I was told to contact you by Barry Epstein.  He handles public relations for
my company, Fit America MD.  We are a nutritionally based, physician led
company that addresses weight problems from a medically sound, healthy
perspective.  We are getting ready to work with numerous corporations like
JM Family, Motorola and even the Sheriff's office & Fire Dept. to help them
combat obesity within their personnel.  I have attached our Worth The Weight
program for your review.  In many instances, instead of paying the $1.00 per
pound to charity, we extend a 40% discount on products to community service
personnel.  In addition, we do not require ANY product sales in order to
assist a company with their weight challenges.  That is a service we provide
FREE.

I would love to work with your staff to make this challenge a reality.
Please let me know how we can help.  My number is 800-221-1186 or you can
e-mail me directly.

I look forward to hearing from you,

Dear Jeb,
 
I am hesitant to speak to you in regards to a couple of things, but here goes.....
 
I have been asked to pray a couple of times this past week regarding the Leadership Prayer Breakfast on March 20th. They have said that your staff has indicated that you might not attend this year's breakfast. I know it is not my place however, I really pray that you attend. I remember being in your office shortly after you where first elected and you told me about the "Tyranny of the Urgent" that keeps you pulled in all directions. I know that you truly understand the importance of prayer and as the leader of our state I can't image the prayer breakfast without you. It would be like the President not attending the National Prayer Breakfast. I have invited people who are traveling from across the state to attend the prayer breakfast to be with the Governor and leaders to pray for our great state and nation. It would be a great disappointment if you aren't there. I hope that you are able to look at your schedule and make the time for this important event.  You, more than most, know that we will probably be at war in the next few weeks and how urgent it is to pray together in difficult times.
 
Regarding the National Day of Prayer, your office says that they don't know anything, yet, and won't indicate when they might know anything. I know it is the day before session ends and it is crazy for you. You have always been so gracious to be a part of the National Day of Prayer. I need to know if you can't be the keynote (although I am still praying that you say yes), but would still like to be a part, as soon as possible. I will have to ask God for "Plan B" if you are not the keynote and time is short. I am doing a television interview with Tim Ireland next week (March 6) to promote prayer for our state and nation and it would really help me to know "something", "anything". Truly, I am not trying to be pushy, it is just difficult to make plans. I hope you know my heart in discussing this with you.
 
I know that your staff keeps you so going in so many different directions in running a state this big. I hope I have not offended you in anyway speaking with you in regards to these events. I appreciate  Columba and you so much and the GREAT sacrifice it is to your family to serve our state. You are continually in my prayers. Thank you for being a godly leader. May the Lord give you great wisdom and discernment in the coming months.
 
Much blessings and prayers,
Pam

Dear Jeb. I am a aircraft "buff". I have several aircraft in my company - a twin engine Kingair and a Hawker 800A (jet). What was the type of aircraft you were in during the incident today? (Thurs). If you don't mind me asking. It seem to be a good airplane to sustain that type of "hit".

Subject:	FCAT accomodations

Dear Gov. Bush,
As a parent of a daughter in 11th grade, as well as a teacher, I would
like to see you make some accomodations for students who want to go to
college after high school, but can't pass the FCAT, even though they are
earning A's and B's in their classes.
Colleges require a high school diploma for entrance, but what is my
daughter to do if she can't pass the FCAT again?
 She wants to be an elementary school teacher. She was only 7 points
away from passing the last FCAT tests, she has all A's and B's in her
classes, but what IF she and others in her same circumstance can't pass
the FCAT by graduation? Are they supposed to work at McDonalds the rest
of their lives?
Don't you think there needs to be some other considerations for students
who want to go forward with their education and have grades above a 2.0
in their high schools?
To the many students who just want to graduate and work at any kind of
job after high school, a standard diploma isn't as important to them,
but to students who want to go to COLLEGE and do more with their lives
and for society, there needs to be some sort of flexibility in your
rules. 
Please consider this suggestion.
                  Thank you,

Jeb:

Yo soy la autora de los libros para enseñarle a los niños a leer en español
(por ejemplo, a los niños americanos se les enseña español como segunda
lengua a través de la Serie Nuevo Bravo, y a los niños hispanos con la
Serie Nuevo Siglo de Español, que comienza con La Cartilla, un método de
enseñarle a leer y escribir a los niños para que puedan transferir las
destrezas (skills) al inglés y lean en los dos idiomas en primer grado). Yo
establecí para Santillana el programa LA FAMILIA (Language Acquisition
through Family Literacy Assistance) para que los padres hispanos puedan
ayudar a sus niños en su educación.

También yo soy la evaluadora de los programas de ESOL (Santillana Intensive
English) basado en NCLB y los requisitos de Language Arts  through ESOL del
estado de la Florida, el cual yo escribí para el Departamento de Educación.

Estos programas se están implementando en varias escuelas con fondos
federales.En los resultados de Broward y Orange County Schools  se puede
observar que los niños LEP que estuvieron dos años en el programa subieron
dos niveles en el FCAT (de nivel 1 al 3) en dos años mientras que los que
no participaron se quedaron atrás.

Jeb, me encantaría que estos programas se pudieran implementar como parte
de tu esfuerzo con los padres y con la enseñanza de la lectura. Díme cómo
se puede lograr.

Cariños,

Arnhilda

As a woman and a Latin, I confess that my brain immediately scanned both

that could fulfill the position of Lieutenant Governor with the
Intellect, Seriousness, Experience, Success, Poise and Integrity Florida
deserves.  I quickly came to the conclusion that of all of the
potentials, the only person that I would trust to live up to my
expectations was TOM WARNER.  Although neither woman; nor, Latin, I
believe that at this time in history, gender nor ethnicity should be a

I pray that a Time Tested Record of Successes (public & private sector),
Strong Intellect (accounting, business, law & legislative), and, the
dedication and ability to truly be of assistance to you in Safeguarding
Florida while you Move It Forward Economically, will be Issues that you
most consider in your selection.

I see no reason to: cause an expensive special election, create more
work for you in having to replace other appointees; nor, any need for
the backlash to you, should you appoint an entrenched lobbyist.

I'd love to see You and the Legislature be able to go forward, next week
with calm and serious purpose.  I believe that by having an individual
with impeccable credentials and upstanding family values, that You, as

Governor,
 
Yes, We are knowledgeable about DROM....but--for the most part--that is only
for military (federal) use. We often use this system to equip our facilities
and obtain certain items that are "serviceable". A lot of it is "junk". Some
of it would surprise you as to how good and serviceable the equipment is
found.
 
However, the MOPP (Chemical gear) suits have a service life and are useless
after that. As you may have read, the improvements in MOPP gear is an issue
of media and military debate.  The suits your agencies are ordering
represent significant improvements over what is available in DROM warehouses
(If any is available that is serviceable).
 
Your constituent is correct in that savings can be achieved through military
surplus "federal" warehouses.

Gov. Bush,
 
When I wrote for Stars & Stripes in South Korea a few years ago I often
requisitioned items from a military surplus program called "DRMO." It's like
the military's storage closet and includes many items that have outlived
their useful lifetimes - like a Humvee which has logged 100,000 miles or
chemical protective gear (also known as MOPP gear). These items often have
been maintained by a computer program and still have years of use left in
them.
 
I believe state agencies - like FDLE and the Florida National Guard - have
DRMO requisition privileges. These items might include chemical protection
suits of the kind you'd like to purchase for first-responders, as well as
gas masks and the like. The DRMO facility I visited in Inchon had everything
from surgical lights to electric guitars to armored cars. It was the size of
about 20 SAM's stores.
 
You're probably already well aware of the DRMO program and how it could be
utilized for Floridians as war approaches - in which event I apologize for
wasting your time. I mention it here only in the hope of doing some good.
 
The program is also known as the Defense Reutilization and Marketing
Service. The following link will take you from there to the DRMO Centers:
http://www.drms.dla.mil/ <http://www.drms.dla.mil/> 
 
You  can also just go to the search page at
http://www.drms.dla.mil/asset/pubalpa.html
<http://www.drms.dla.mil/asset/pubalpa.html>  and enter "chemical" under
product name. I found a bunch of chem-bio protective gear when I did that.
 
If this suggestion proves useful I'd really appreciate one of those MOPP
suits. I'm not too crazy about duct tape and plastic sheeting (smile).

Victor Epstein

"winter".
 
Of course, I can not thank you enough for your recent decision elevating
me
to the Appellate Court.  Hopefully, by now you received the personal
thank
you I  sent to you in Tallahassee.  

If you are able to come to the investiture, it is looking like May 2(

school and middle school auditorium.  With some "Pasco" pizza and other
assorted goodies to follow(in the cafeteria of course!). In the event
you
are able to attend, I would love to take advantage of your presence by
incorporating you into the program; in whatever capacity you feel most
comfortable.  This is going to be a great day  not just for me and my
family, but all of Pasco county.  

I hope you don't mind me asking for your consideration in this matter,
but I
really wanted to drive right up to wherever you were at the moment,
bring my
family, and just thank you in person when Rocky called me with the great
news.  So if you can come here it will save me a trip!  Also, in my
heart I
feel a connection with everything you have been trying to accomplish in
the
state and in the judiciary.  I couldn't think of a grander person to
share
this occasion with.  Of course, if your schedule doesn't permit, I would
still welcome the opportunity to thank you in person.  Please let me
have
your thoughts when you have a moment to respond.

I guess that's why you're the governor and I'm a newspaper hack. :)

Subject:	PLEASE DELAY CHANGES TO HISTORICAL RESOURCES

The Honorable Jeb Bush:
 
The current proposals to make changes to the Division of Historical Resources, including relocating part of the resource material to Nova appear to be hurried and can actually end up costing taxpayers more in the long run.  
 
A thorough analysis of the costs and effects must be undertaken.  Give Secretary Hood and the Florida Historical Commission a chance to complete an in-depth report to you.
 
The proposed cuts in staff for the Division are devastating.  Making government "small" does not necessarily make government efficient.  We are the fourth largest state and growing by leaps and bounds every day.  The number of employees at the Division is very much in keeping (in fact below the level) for a state of our size.
 
Over the last 20 years $212 million in state money has been invested in historical projects statewide.  This is now beginning to pay off to the tune of $4.2 billion annually.  We need the assets of the Division of Historical Resources including the staff at the division to continue this positive growth and economic engine.
 
We are a totally volunteer organization in East Central Florida and cannot accomplish our preservation efforts without the guidance and expertise furnished by the Division of Historical Resources.  Through our preservation efforts we are providing jobs, enhancing the quality of education, and increasing the resources available for tourists in our area.  The value of all the volunteer hours to be lost is not being considered in the proposal to basically dismantle the Division of Historical Resources.
 
Please rethink your proposals which are now creating much momentum and political fodder for the Democrats.  This has the potential to have serious political repercussions in the next year's elections.
 
We are well aware of the difficult choices this year, but surely the Division can be left as status quo for one more year while a thorough analysis can be accomplished.
 
Thank you for taking time to consider my opinions.

Re: Response to your email on February 25th and transfer of my father:
 
 
Deputy Secretary Hadi:
 
I appreciate your email that was sent to me on February 25,2003 regarding the transfer of my father on February 20,2003 to Manor Care Nursing Home & Rehabilitation facility in St. Petersburg Florida.
 
First, I wish to thank Governor Bush, Secretary Jerry Regier of DCF and Allison Hewitt for their aggressive intervention into this matter.  There are others in your agency that made this transfer possible that need to be congratulate as well.  Once again this was a matter that he and our family should have never gone through.  But knowing, the commitment and passion that the Governor has express in his various speeches,  to strength the family in the State of Florida.  I did not have any doubt that this matter will be resolve within weeks.   
 
For the family, it has been a long 36years in not knowing, who was my father or knowing the person that had something to do with my genis.  I hope this will never occur to any other perdon in the State of Florida.
 
The transfer was completed, but there are still several issues in his transfer.  First, my father was transfer to Manor Care.  His medical records, that was I told that will accompany his transfer and accuring to state status,this is requirement that he would be tranfer with his medical records.......For example the 3008 form, H&P, lab test for the last six months to the facility.   I believe these are standard document that are supposed be transfer with patients, once there are move to another facility. Perhaps, I could have your department assistance in recovering these documents.  In order for my father to be adequate diagnose and evaluated.  I would like the local doctors in the  St. Petersburg Manor Care facility have a true physiological and psychological analysis of my father behavior.  Also, I wish to have an full history of his mental condition and medical diagnoses.
 
I would appreciate your assistance in gathering the medical record , why he was placed in the Florida State Mental Hospital.  This will give the family a understanding of the  character and person that we was denied for approximate 36years....... I would have better understanding of his being......I would be able to pass on to my children characters, identity and family trait.  This will assist us to put a closer and better understanding of unanswered question that we have had in the pass.
 
I will wait to her your response to my request in these matter.  Thank you.  
 
Sincerely, 
 
Vicente Lopez, Jr.

Subject:	FACT Concerns

February 28, 2003

Mr. Jeb Bush,

I have never been one to get involved in the political realm other than
consciously voting during every election.  As a public school employee, I
feel it is time to speak my mind.  It is my hope that Mr. Bush himself will
take the time to read this letter.

My daughter, Sarah, is probably one of the hardest working students you will
ever meet.  She is the type of young person who pushes herself to the limit,
studying nightly till 9:00 p.m. or later to make sure she gets the best
grades possible in school.  As you know, she and her fellow students are now
required to pass the FCAT in order to be awarded a high school diploma.
This is a requirement she, and many others, will probably never meet.  It
isn’t because she isn’t trying.  She visits the FCAT Explorer site daily,
has two tutors, and stays after school four days a week for additional help
on the test.

Depending on the report you study, Florida ranks somewhere between 48’TH and
last in its high school graduation rate!  What are we thinking?  I fully
understand the need to raise educational standards and have always supported
doing so until the FCAT requirement.  It is a crime for a good student to
attend school for twelve years, earn 24 credits, hold at least a 2.0 grade
point average and then walk away without a high school diploma because of a
single test!   It appears to me that we are leaving quite a few young people
behind!

Obviously, as a teacher, I am a believer in the public school system.  I
have learned that private schools are not required to give this test.  I
would guess that most of our legislators probably send their children to
private schools.  However, for most of us, this is not an option.  Have you
and our legislature taken the time to closely examine the FCAT?  My guess is
no.  I doubt seriously that most of our legislators could earn a passing
score on the test.

Again, I understand the need for standards.  Not all students are college
bound, but all students are required to attend high school.  I have no
problem with entrance exams at the college level, but to deny our young
people a fair beginning in life is just unfair!  I wish you could meet Sarah
and the thousands of students like her.  This next week will be a
particularly difficult time for each and every one of them as they take the
FCAT.  Many will simply give up!

I honestly believe that the State of Florida will pay dearly for our poor
graduation rate.  In ten years there may not be enough prisons to hold all
our young citizens who were doomed from the beginning of their adulthood
when they were not awarded a high school diploma.  Please carefully consider
this letter.  There are literally thousands of parents who feel the way I
do.  Let’s find a better way to educate the State of Florida’s youth!

I eagerly await your response to my thoughts…

Respectfully,
Jim Way

Dear Governor:  I was in Florence Italy when the Arno flooded.  The National Library had been harmed and we the students moved millions of books.  The whole world came to the aid of Florence over this tragedy.  School Children all over Europe volunteered their time to dry these books by hand.  NATO donated trucks so these books could be moved.  The world is still mad that the Alexandrian Library was destroyed the second time by someone who believed only one certain book should be read.  What I am trying to say is leaders come and go, but ideas and the preservation of the written word is very important.  The State Library is a treasure for the now and into the future.  It belongs to the people of Florida, it is their history.  Just as the Library of Congress is the Nations history.  People expect their collective knowledge to be protected by the State.   I will bet if you do this, after you are gone there will be a campaign to bring the Library back together and laws made that this can never happen again.  25 cent is my bet to you in the future.

Dear Governor Bush,

This is an unabashed promotional piece for me and my company, Com <http://www.comnective.com> nective. I'm hoping to get your attention away from your duties as Florida's leader for a moment to let you know what I'm doing in the hope that you'll remember me if you need or learn of someone who could use the help of someone with my skills.

For the last 20 years, I've been involved in helping my various employers and clients communicate with their customers, prospects, government, the media and other key audiences. Fifteen years ago, I started helping people apply computers and other technologies to enhance their efforts to communicate with key audiences.

Three years ago, I founded Comnective with the intent of helping people and organizations understand and cope with the fact that their future success will at least partially depend on how well they manage "the point where communication and technology meet" for their organization.



  <http://www.comnective.com/Images/bf.jpg> 



In other words, I believe that there is an appropriate, unique and cost-effective mix of old-fashioned and high-tech communication tools that should be brought to bear by every organization. The choices people make today about how to take advantage of this convergence will determine tomorrow's winners and losers. Currently, too many people and companies get advice about communicating messages and assistance with the tools necessary to distribute messages from separate sources. The "cart" isn't even attached to the "horse."



  _____  



Tools that can expand your reach


  <http://www.comnective.com/Images/reachstar.gif> 	
Recent developments in Internet technologies allow me to help organizations deliver interactive personalized messages, action alerts, newsletters, meeting notices and other key communications instantly without having to deal with the costs associated with hard-copy communications. 

This e-mail is an example of what I refer to as "Branded Group Communications." While this "rich-format" message appears to be addressed only to you, it actually was automated to be personalized with your name and some other pertinent phrases, then sent to a list of some of my elected and appointed friends.  Not only is this kind of mail attention-getting, but it also makes communication to lists more secure.

How many times have you gotten messages in which your e-mail address is exposed either in the "To" or the "Cc" field, along with numerous other addresses?  Are you aware that your information can easily be captured by any of those recipients (or those to whom the message is forwarded) for inclusion on other lists?  The potential for your information being harvested for "spamming" purposes is great.  You certainly do not want to put your clients, prospects or friends in such a similar situation.  My methods help you avoid such difficulties.


  

	

  _____  


So, Governor,what I'd like for you to do is... 


When you find yourself grappling with which technical communications tools are appropriate for your needs, wondering how to maximize the return on your existing technology investments, or becoming interested in automating some or all of your key communication to staff or constituents, remember that I'm here to help. Then call me at (954) 532-5956 or drop  <mailto:finch@comnective.com?subject=I%20received%20your%20%20message%20and%20I%20would%20like%20to%20discuss%20what%20you%20can%20do%20for%20me!> me a note so we can get to work!

Thanks!





I really appreciate your taking the time to read this communiqué. It is not my desire to intrude upon you in the future if you aren't interested, so I am building a list of people who wish to receive periodic communication tips, commentary, technology alerts and other useful information. Please indicate your interest by selecting one of the links below. Depending on your setup, either your e-mail program or web-mail browser will open to a new message. Simply send the blank message that appears, leaving the subject line intact, and my system will handle the rest.

Thanks again for your time!

Subject:	Carol Wehle recommendation for Ex Director of SWFWMD

Dear Governor Bush:  

Just wanted to drop you a note indicating that if you were to select Carol
Wehle for Executive Director of the SWFWMD, you would be selecting an
absolutely oustanding person!  I have known Carol for many years.  She is a
P.E. with an engineering degree from MIT.  She was Chair of the County
Commission in Brevard County for two years.  She worked for SJRWMD for about
12 years I think and at SFWMD she has done wonders as Director of the
Greater West Coast (includes eight of the 16 counties of the SFWMD - Henry
is only managing the other half of the District).  She has finally made
people in Collier and Lee counties happy with what the SFWMD is doing.   She
is a good people person and adept at handling difficult political
situations.  She is very experienced with the water management district
process and has great Tallahassee contacts.  Carol has all of the experience
needed to make an excellent Executive Director and get things done in an
efficient manner.   I also believe that she would be the first woman ever to
be appointed as an Executive Director of a water management district - her
appointment would be another first for the State of Florida!!!!

We remember you daily in our thoughts and prayers.  The very best to you and
your family....

Dear Sirs,
We feel it is important that the State Library System is retained. A move to Nova a private institution is not in the best interests of the citizens of Florida. This resource is important and needs to be accessible to public branch libraries throughout the state. Mrs.Bush is a strong supporter of literacy for the country and I  am sure would also recommend keeping this important resource. Please return an answer to my email so I will know it has been received.

Subject:	Pensacola Jr. College EMS/USLA Curriculum

Dear Chris, et al . . .
 
I have had meetings or conversations with several key community leaders including the CEO of Baptist Hospital, the President of Pensacola Junior College, some State Legislators, and County Commissioners regarding the curriculum.  
 
Everyone seems to be on board and very excited about doing the curriculum at PJC, especially the medical/trauma community.  There seems to be some small concern right now at PJC over the "new-ness" of the concept.  They have some concerns about "getting enough students" and "placing graduates . . .".  That is, this is so new as a concept (educating Life Savers and giving degrees in EMS/Life Saving, that they are concerned that there is REALLY enough need and market for their student-product.  I do understand that designing and implementing what we are proposing is an expensive and risky proposition for them.  It is my desire to assist them in allaying this concern as much a possible.
 
I see two ways.  One is to try to get hiring criteria to recognize and if possible, give priority to or in some situations require graduates of the curriculum.  Two is to promote the curriculum as a career opportunity.
 
The political backing is very impressive and should over come this concern; however, I am about to start a campaign to the County Commissions of all of the coastal counties in Florida (and perhaps other states in the S.E.) wherein I lobby them to amend their hiring criteria for Open Water Life Savers, giving hiring preference to graduates of a degree curriculum comparable to Miramar/Pensacola Jr. College.  Also I will be lobbying the State Legislature to amend the hiring criteria for coastal state parks, and lobbying the US Park Service to do the same; asking for replies indicating interest and or indication of compliance, should the degree program be implemented.  This campaign is being designed to give PJC and the State indication of interest and the "market" for their student-product.
 
Can you give me any suggestions regarding such a campaign.  At least two Escambia County Commissioners have already agreed that they are interested in offering such an amendment to the credential requirements for Escambia County to support a EMS/USLA Curriculum at PJC.  Their hiring credential and qualification requirements are also the basis for Pensacola Beach as well, as I remember.
 
In order to mount this campaign, I need to produce a "description" of the curriculum and the student-product it is expected to produce.  Can you describe the talking points of what makes the Miramar program unique, and perhaps put me in contact with someone there at Miramar who can indicate to me the demand for and how successful their program is?
 
I also need to have some verbiage or criteria points on the program to offer the county commissioners and state legislators for them to use to write their legislation.  I could simply use USLA Certified Training and Paramedic or EMT Certification, but I believe you told me that there are elements of Oceanography, Marine Biology, and Meteorology also included in the Miramar curriculum.  Is there a brochure or course description of the Miramar program available that I could excerpt from?  I must use a very broad brush here, in that I cannot imply that such elements ARE the curriculum at PJC, but only a PJC curriculum once approved and implemented would likely contain equivalent or comparable elements.
 
For now I am seeing the possibility of two programs, please give me your feelings on this . . .
 
(1) A CERTIFICATE program that would yield a product with USLA Open Water Certification, and EMT Certification. Probably a 6 to 9 month program.
(2) A DEGREE (Associate of Science) that would yield a product with a Paramedic Certification and USLA Open Water Certification.  Probably a 24 to 30 month program.
 
I know in my heart that this is a concept whose time has come, and Pensacola Jr. College is the place it should happen.  PLEASE give me your most candid opinions and insight on this concept of blending the Miramar USLA Certified Open Water Curriculum with the Paramedic program at PJC to create a USLA Certified / EMS Certified Open Water Rescue Specialist.  Also, I would very much like suggestions as to what to name the curriculum (although PJC will officially do it) and what to call the graduates.
 
Thanks for your help and input.

Hello Governor Bush:
 
I applaud you for a pattern of timely and consistent responses to Floridians who voice concerns to you via e-mail. You have responded to my communications on a number of occasions, none of which were problem related like this. The fact that I am typing this at 3:00 A.M. illustrates the significance my concern and the concern of many educators in the west-central Florida area.
 
I am asking for your involvement in the resolution of serious faculty concerns in the Department of Educational Leadership and Policy Studies (formerly the Educational Leadership Department) at the University of South Florida. There are highly competent and professional people in this department, but unfortunately they are the frustrated minority. In an effort to be succinct, I will bullet evidence that many professional educators and graduate students (and professors) have found to be pervasive grounds for potential grievances and litigation for a number of years:
 
1. Graduate students and professional educators are consistently misadvised in program policy and planning. This has financial, time and personal impact on people who want nothing more than to prepare themselves to better serve the children in our schools.
2. Policies and procedures (including program requirements and guidelines) are constantly changed with no notice to graduate students.
3. The chairman of the department recently left his position due to serious and continuous conflict among faculty members.
4. Sophomoric conflict among faculty members resulted in administration having to actually divide the department (organizationally and geographically) to attempt collegiality.
5. The interim department chair was called out of retirement to deal with these and other serious problems.
6. A search was conducted to hire a new chair. The identified best choice among applicants was not offered the job due to an internal failure (not the applicants failure) to address a specific procedure. This hire would have placed one African-American in the department and this would have been based on credentials ... not his ethnicity.
7. Professors intimidate and threaten graduate students by informing them that they have no obligation to serve on doctoral committees and that they do this out of benevolence. The fact that few professors have earned credentialing to serve on doctoral committees and fewer have earned credentialing to serve as doctoral committee chairpersons places graduate students and the future of school leadership at risk.
8. I understand that numerous complaints from many graduate students have gone to the department chair, the dean and the president.
 
Outrage regarding this program is widespread among the educational community.
 
I am prompted to raise these concerns at this time because of personal impact. I am in the dissertation phase of my graduate studies with the plan to study education reform in Florida. More specifically, I have proposed to the department a desire to conduct an objective study of arguments against state education reform made by the educational bureaucracy. I am convinced that my academic freedom and freedom of expression are being violated because professors do not want the status quo studied ... not even objectively. I have even received inappropriate commentary regarding my Christian beliefs. This is all very wrong. Mistreatment also includes continuous vague requirements to revise my writing and a clear attempt to delay my graduation for the fourth time. In fact, a department member boldly informed me that he was a union representative and that due to a state budget shortfall, nearly no one in the department will work during the summer and consequently no one is obligated to work with graduate students. He also informed me that (as a union representative) he was in opposition to the possibility that the board of trustees would advocate the hiring of adjuncts as a cost-saving measure ... suggesting that the unions position would place the progress of graduate students at a stand still. 
 
I will not explain to my wife and young children that promises that I was to fulfill long ago will again be delayed. My responsibilities as a husband and father come first. The attempt to block my dissertation proposal defense this semester and dissertation defense next semester (as articulated to me my by the department) is unfair. Especially considering that due to no fault of my own and unfair treatment, my graduation has been thwarted for the past three semesters.
 
I could go on with more evidence of harassment and intimidation. I will instead ask for your assistance in this matter. I am prepared for my stand on these issues to negatively impact my plans to graduate and perhaps even my career. I do believe, however, that there are things that we all must stand for. Although this thought is in no way expressed in my dissertation, I believe that the academic needs of all children in our state are being addressed ... for the first time ... as a result of current reform. People should have the academic freedom and freedom of expression to objectively study and potentially support this. 
 
Thank you.

Dear Jeb:

I couldn't help but think of you when I read the article in this week's
People magazine about Georgia Governer, Sonny Perdue's battle to slim
down
his staff with the "Capitol Challenge".  I think Florida should
challenge
his state!

I was told to contact you by Barry Epstein.  He handles public relations
for
my company, Fit America MD.  We are a nutritionally based, physician led
company that addresses weight problems from a medically sound, healthy
perspective.  We are getting ready to work with numerous corporations
like
JM Family, Motorola and even the Sheriff's office & Fire Dept. to help
them
combat obesity within their personnel.  I have attached our Worth The
Weight
program for your review.  In many instances, instead of paying the $1.00
per
pound to charity, we extend a 40% discount on products to community
service
personnel.  In addition, we do not require ANY product sales in order to
assist a company with their weight challenges.  That is a service we
provide
FREE.

I would love to work with your staff to make this challenge a reality.
Please let me know how we can help.  My number is 800-221-1186 or you
can
e-mail me directly.

I look forward to hearing from you,

Subject: Your response re USFWS Incidental Taking

Colleen:

Jeb's (yours I assume) reply to those who sent the Governor letters
commenting on the USFWS MMPA Incidental Take Regulations (proposed) were
answered with "These efforts have been most successful in reducing manatee
deaths due to watercraft."  That is not true.

I would very much appreciate you, or whoever provided the statement, to
explain and provide the data that permits you to say that.  There is no
study, which would allow you to make such a statement.  In fact, there is
data that directly refutes your statement.  I am attaching the record of
boat-barge related mortalities as a % of total mortality, which shows that
the mortality is statistically consistent with the observed manatee
population increase.  I also am attaching a set of charts that identify some
of the principal reasons for change in the annual mortality, all of which
are derived from the FF&WCC-FMRI Database.

I can only conclude that you are spinning your response and are ignorant of
the true facts.  This is not something that relies on opinion, but on the
data, which again does not show what you claim.  Have you bought in so much
that you accept statements like that from others like SMC? If you got the
statement from Scott Calleson of FF&WCC, then I understand, but it's still
wrong.

Another very interesting fact is that neither the state FF&WCC or federal
USFWS has conducted and published a study comparing the before and after
effects of manatee slow speed zones, and that's not because the data isn't
available.  It's because they get the wrong answers to their way of
thinking.  Scott Calleson of FF&WCC was quoted as saying that the reason why
the Brevard boat/barge-related mortalities went up from 7 in 2001 to 17 in
2002 after slow speed zones were implemented early in 2002, was because
sometimes it takes a while for the zones to become effective.  Does that
seem credible in light of the very heavy enforcement that took place in 2002
in Brevard waters? I am not saying the zones caused the increase, but they
sure didn't result in a decrease as you claim they do.

Mr. Calleson also said that Lee County's reduction from 23 to 13 during that
same time period was due to the recently implemented slow speed zones.  The
fact is that the fuel barges -tugs were no longer bringing fuel oil to the
power plant because they had converted to gas during that time period.

So, please send me the data on which your claim is based, or stop putting
out such misinformation.  I earlier sent an e-mail to Governor Jeb covering
other erroneous statements in his (yours) canned response.
I hope you find the attached charts informative and useful.

1.      Business climate (education, transportation, tax policy, tort reform, etc.) is most critical.
2.      Florida’s economic development public/private partnerships (Enterprise, Visit Florida, etc.) are “selling Florida better than other states and more efficiently.”
3.      We must do a better job of strategic planning and we strongly support the Governor’s new economic development strategic planning process.
4.      We need to expand our “Centers of Excellence Core Competency.”
5.      Obtaining the FTAA Secretariat in Miami is one of the State’s highest priorities.
6.      We must more efficiently use our “Rockstar” Governor (Governor Jeb) for advancing the Florida economic agenda.
7.      State funding for Florida’s public/private partnerships should not be reduced.  There is recognition of Florida’s budget constraints, but the Governor’s top three priorities should not be cut.
8.      Critical high priority fundings are a) Rainy Day Fund; b) Quick Action Closing Fund for Governor; c) Centers for Excellence; d) Phase out sales tax for equipment used predominantly for research and development.
 
I know Glenda, Tony and Jesse will do a great job in advocating the key points of our transition team.  Again, I apologize that I cannot be there on Monday, but I know all of you will make our case to Florida’s other leaders.

Our new Director, Allan Duffie, is doing a great job turning things around and I am confident that you will see aggressive action through his leadership and his suggestions to the Commission.
       I also wish to bring to your attention a young man who wishes to serve you and the state of Florida by becoming a member of the St.Johns River Water Management Board.  His name is Scott Ryals, my nephew, the son of my brother Dr. John R. Ryals down in Ormond Beach Florida.  Scott has been extremely active in providing leadership in the Young Republicans down there.  He successfully manages his Dads Tomoka Oaks Golf and Country Club.  He is the epitome of what you would look for in a father with wholesome family values. He is bright, energetic, and laid back but the kind of person that people listen to when he talks.  In other words, he is the type person that you will like and who will be loyal to you.
       Thanks for your consideration of this fine young man, not because he happens to be my nephew, but because Scott Ryals is one good human being who is worthy and well qualified for service on the St. Johns Water Management District.

Dear Governor Bush,

I am outraged upon learning of the cowardly move by the Department of
Business and Professional Regulation to scrap all regulations
controlling
Talent Agents.  From the beginning of their involvement  they have been
very reticent to enforce the regulations they have been sworn to
enforce.
 It took the Florida Motion Picture and Television Association years to
get these minimal regulations passed by the legislature.  Before this
modest legislation, "talent agents" were free to plunder and defraud
countless innocent people who struggled to better themselves and their
children by getting into the movie and television industry.  This
industry in Florida has suffered greatly due to these "wolves."  By
scrapping the current regulations to save money, you are giving tacit
approval to these unscrupulous plunderers to prey on an unsuspecting
public and doing your part to destroy the budding movie and television
here in Florida.  If your fingerprints are on this bill, the newly
outraged victims will seek out those responsible.  

If the DBPR wants to save money by abolishing regulations, why not scrap
all the regulations supervised by them and abolish this timid agency. 
Send the responsibility to the Attorney General.  They have the will to
rid us of the scoundrels and protect the public.  If not, make the DPBR
enforce their responsibilities and give them the money to do it.

Thank you,

William P. Penrose
Vice President
Florida Motion Picture and Television Association

Dear Governor:

Yesterday I met with Senator Rudy Garcia who explained to me the 
difficult choices facing you and the legislature concerning this year's 
budget.  First, I commend you for not taking the easy route of proposing 
tax increases.  So much has been accomplished during the last few years 
towards reducing the tax burden for the citizens of Florida.  However, I 
sincerely believe this is payback time for the companies and individuals 
who have been the beneficiaries of  these policies.  I would like you to 
consider calling a meeting, perhaps in a central location, consisting of 
you, the Speaker of the House and the Senate President, along with the 
leaders of  the business communities throughout the state.  The purpose 
of the meeting would be to appeal to the business community to partner 
with the legislature and you to meet some of the urgent needs of those 
individuals who will be effected by the budget cuts.  An appeal should 
be made for substantial funding by the business community and 
individuals to assume some of the responsibilities that the state can no 
longer meet.  I would suggest following through in this effort in 
various cities from Jacksonville to Miami to assure its success.  With 
your initiative and the support of the legislature, I think we can set a 
model for the rest of the country during these difficult times.

Please let me know what you think.

Best regards.

Dear Governor Bush,

My good friend, JC Bowman, said he would pass along to you the manuscript of 
my forthcoming book, "To Build a Better Teacher: the Rise of a Competitive 
Education Industry," with the thought that you might wish to write a blurb 
for the book jacket. I know the demands on your time must be enormous and I 
am honored that you would even consider this request. I just thought at this 
point I would see if a blurb is still a possibility. My publisher (the 
Greenwood Publishing Group of Westport, CT) is getting close to the point of 
production.

It has been my pleasure in my work to follow Florida's school reform 
initiatives, which are very much in accord with the accountability, choice, 
and transparency recently recommended by the Hoover Institution's Koret Task 
Force. Under your leadership, Florida very much deserves the distinction of 
being "School Choice Central," as education researcher Jay Greene has dubbed 
it.

Thanks for considering my book, and all best wishes to you as you lead the

      I met you for the first time in Orlando at a State Convention of the Florida Motion Picture & Television Association (FMPTA) where you spent a lot of your time observing us. I am extremely grateful for your interest in our craft. 
      Your work to establish a new film commissioners office has paid off and we are enjoying more opportunity to work.I am, however, greatly concerned about the proposed de-regulation of Talent Agents. Whlie your motives are sound, the industry suffers a great deal from unethical Agents who ply on little children and adults alike. They perform such acts as selling unnecessary photographs to their clients, charging for classes taught by unskilled and unlicensed teachers, failure to get auditions for their clients and when successful in getting a client work, withholding their wages for extended periods of time or forever. 
      The only way to prevent this is to regulate these agents and to enforce the rules. They  flaunt the rules we have not unlike Saddam and when caught, merely change their name and go back into business. Is this what you want going on in our wonderful state? I don't. 
      Please reconsider your recommendation and allow us to bring the billions of dollars into the state annually.

I heard about your "jolt" yesterday and read you were not frightened. Well,
I was!  When I heard it on "breaking news," all I could think of was, what
if?  

Please Jeb, don't fly in bad weather especially in light aircraft!!!!  You
know how dangerous that can be.

Anyway, I am more than glad you are alright.  Thank God!

Governor Bush

It has come to our attention that you are considering
three finalists for the position of FDOT Secretary.

We at the Florida Youth Conservation Corps strongly
urge you to give prime consideration to Mr. Jose Abreu.

We have had contact with Mr. Abreu on several occassions
and have found him to be of high character and deeply
committed to the Florida Department of Transportation. 

On a more practical side, Mr. Abreu is already fully familiar
with the operations of FDOT and can hit the ground running. As
the others are from out of State there will be a time lag in 
getting them up to speed. As this is the beginning of the 
Legislative session and there are many key issues on the table, 
the State can not afford the time to bring a new comer up to 
speed. 

We firmly feel that Mr. Abreu will be the best choice from both
a practical stand point and from a character stand point.

Thank you

Dear Governor Bush,
I believe you are in the final stage of deliberations on the appointment of a new Secretary for Florida's Department of Transportation. With respect, I would like to recommend Jose Abreu to you for this position. I believe Mr. Abreu's experience and background make him uniquely qualified to meet the challenges of this demanding and vitally important position. In my opinion, growth, environmental and resource management issues, coupled with changes in Floridian social, financial and demographic circumstances require not only the imagination of a visionary but a pragmatism born of experience. From this prospective Mr. Abreu is an excellent choice.

This man looks like the most qualified for the position that the great state of Florida has a vacancy in. I am in the transportation business in this state as well as Georgia & South Carolina and feel that some of the past or present people have pulled the wool over some eyes for their own gain and not the best for the whole state. With some of the past administration and a few of the present we have fell back into the dark ages with the dot in this state and it is going to cost a fortune to keep the quality up with some of the new rules and regulations.

Stat., To Provide Sovereign Immunity To Not-For-Profit Colleges and Universities When Their Accredited Medical Schools Affiliate And Agree To Render Comprehensive Health Care Services To Public Hospital Patients At Public Statutory Teaching Hospitals, Other Health Care Facilities Owned or Used By A Governmental Entity Or At Other Locations Under Contract With A Governmental Entity. 
 
          An Act amending s.768.28, Fla. Stat., to provide sovereign immunity to not-for-profit colleges and universities whose medical, dental, or nursing school, or any other academic programs of medical education accredited by any association, agency, council, commission or other accrediting body recognized by the State of Florida as a condition for licensure of their graduates (hereinafter "Medical School") and to their faculty, their health care professionals, practitioners, and ancillary caregivers and employees (hereinafter "employees") when any such Medical School affiliates or contracts with a public statutory teaching hospital, any other health care facility owned or used by the state, county, municipality, public authority, special taxing district with health care responsibilities or other local governmental entity, or other locations under contract with the governmental entity (hereinafter "Public Hospital"), to allow its employees to provide any of the following services (collectively "Patient Services"):  (i) any or all comprehensive health care services, as defined in s.641.19(2), Fla. Stat., to patients of a Public Hospital, including any administrative services related thereto; (ii) supervision of interns, residents and fellows (hereinafter "Resident Physicians") providing comprehensive health care services to patients of a Public Hospital; and/or (iii) access to participation in medical research protocols.
 
Findings and intent. --  
 
            (a)  The Legislature finds that access to quality, affordable health care for all Floridians is a necessary goal for the State, and that Public Hospitals play an essential role in providing access to comprehensive health care services.
 
            (b) The Legislature further finds that access to quality health care at Public Hospitals is enhanced when Public Hospitals affiliate and coordinate their common endeavors with Medical Schools. These affiliations have proved to be an integral part of the delivery of more efficient and economical health care services to patients of Public Hospitals, by offering quality graduate medical education programs to Resident Physicians who provide Patient Services at Public Hospitals.  These affiliations ensure continued access to quality comprehensive health care services for Floridians and, therefore, should be encouraged in order to maintain and expand such services.  
 
            (c) The Legislature finds that when Medical Schools affiliate or enter into contracts with Public Hospitals to provide comprehensive health care services to patients of Public Hospitals, they greatly increase their exposure to claims arising out of alleged medical malpractice and other allegedly negligent acts because some colleges and universities, their Medical Schools and employees do not have the same level of protection against liability claims as governmental entities and their public employees providing the same Patient Services to the same Public Hospital patients.
 
            (d) The Legislature finds that the high cost of litigation, unequal liability exposure and increased medical malpractice insurance premiums have adversely impacted the ability of some Medical Schools to permit their employees to provide Patient Services to patients of Public Hospitals. This finding is consistent with the report issued in April 2002 by the American Medical Association declaring Florida to be one of twelve states in the midst of a medical liability insurance crisis.  The crisis in the availability and affordability of medical malpractice insurance is a contributing factor in the reduction of access to quality health care in Florida.  In the past fifteen years, the number of Public Hospitals in the state of Florida has declined significantly.  In 1988, thirty-three hospitals were owned or operated by the State and local governments, or established as taxing districts.  In 1991, that number dropped to twenty-eight.  In 2001, only eighteen remained, seven of these concentrated in one county.  Thus, eleven Public Hospitals serve sixty-six counties in Florida.  If no corrective action is taken, this health care crisis will lead to a continued reduction of Patient Services in Public Hospitals.   
            
            (e) The Legislature finds that the public is better served and will benefit from corrective action to address the foregoing concerns.  It is imperative that the Legislature further the public benefit by conferring sovereign immunity upon colleges and universities, their Medical Schools, and their employees when, pursuant to an affiliation agreement or a contract to provide comprehensive health care services, they provide Patient Services to patients of Public Hospitals.     
 
            (f) It is the intent of the Legislature that colleges and universities that affiliate with Public Hospitals be granted sovereign immunity under s.768.28, Fla. Stat., in the same manner and to the same extent as the State, its agencies and political subdivisions.  It is also the intent of the Legislature that employees of colleges and universities who provide Patient Services to patients of a Public Hospital be immune from lawsuits in the same manner and to the same extent as employees and agents of the State, its agencies and political subdivisions, and further, that they shall not be held personally liable in tort or named as a party defendant in an action while performing Patient Services except as provided in s. 768.28(9)(a), Fla. Stat. 
 
Amendment. -- To accomplish the foregoing, the Legislature hereby creates a new subsection 768.28(10)(e):
 
            (10)(e)  Any not-for-profit college or university with a medical, dental or nursing school, or any other academic programs of medical education accredited by any association, agency, council, commission or accrediting body recognized by the State of Florida as a condition for licensure of its graduates (hereinafter collectively referred to as "Medical School"), that has entered into an affiliation agreement or a contract to allow its faculty, its health care professionals, practitioners, and ancillary caregivers and employees (hereinafter "employees") to provide Patient Services to hospital patients treated at  a Public Hospital, shall, along with the employees of such Medical School, be deemed agents of the governmental entity for purposes of this section and shall be immune from liability for torts in the same manner and to the same extent as the State, its agencies and subdivisions, while providing Patient Services.  Patient Services are defined as the following: (i) any or all comprehensive health care services, as defined in s.641.19(2), Fla. Stat., including related administrative services to patients of a Public Hospital; (ii) supervision of interns, residents and fellows providing any or all Patient Services to patients of a Public Hospital; and/or (iii) access to participation in medical research protocols. Public Hospital is defined as a statutory teaching hospital, any other health care facility owned or used by the state, county, municipality, public authority, special taxing district with health care responsibilities or other local governmental entity or at other locations under contract with the governmental entity.  No such employee or agent of colleges or universities or their Medical Schools, shall be personally liable in tort or named as a party defendant in any action arising from the provision of any or all Patient Services to patients of a Public Hospital, except as provided in s. 768.28(9)(a).  
 
            
Amendment:  To accomplish the foregoing, subsection 768.28(9)(b)(2) is amended to read as follows:
 
            2.  "officer, employee, or agent" includes, but is not limited to, any college, or university or its Medical School that enters into an affiliation  agreement or a contract to allow its employees to provide Patient Services to patients treated at Public Statutory Teaching Hospitals, any other health care facilities owned or used by a governmental entity, or other locations under contract with the governmental entity to provide patient services to public hospital patients (hereinafter "Public Hospital") pursuant to Section 768.28(10)(e); any faculty member or other health care professional, practitioner, or ancillary caregiver or employee of a college, university, or its Medical School that enters into an affiliation agreement or a contract to provide comprehensive health care services with a Public Hospital or its governmental owner, and who provides Patient  Services to patients of Public Hospitals pursuant to Section 768.28(10)(e); any health care provider when providing services pursuant to s.766.1115; any member of the Florida Health Services Corps, as defined in s.381.0302, who provides uncompensated care to medically indigent persons referred by the Department of Health, and any public defender or her or his employee or agent, including among others, an assistant public defender and an investigator.
 
Amendment:  Amend Section 766.1115(11) as follows:  
            
            (11) Applicability.  This section applies to incidents occurring on or after April 17, 1992.  This section does not apply to any health care contract entered into by the Department of Corrections which is subject to s.768.28(10)(b).  This section does not apply to any affiliation agreement or contract to provide comprehensive health care services entered into by a Medical School to provide Patient Services to patients of Public Hospitals that is subject to s.768.28(10)(e). Nothing in this section in any way reduces or limits the rights of the state or any of its agencies or subdivisions to any benefit currently provided under s.768.28.
 
 
This Act shall take effect upon becoming law, and shall apply to all claims accruing on or after the effective date.

Jeb, 

I am asking for your help in a matter to do with our Tournament Referee Alan Mills and a temporary Visa.  Alan Mills has been our Tournament Referee for the over the past 10 years.  We applied for his visa in September as we always do and for some reason this year we still have not received anything from INS.  The only information we can get is that it is still pending.  As you know the tournament is only 2 weeks away so we are getting a little concerned.

We have contacted Ileana Ros-Lehtinen's office and she is submitting a letter for Monday delivery to Evelyn Upchurch, Director of INS (Texas Office) to ask for her intervention.   He is due to fly into the U.S. on March 13th.  If there is any way you can help to expedite this matter it would be greatly appreciated.

Let me know. 

Thank You, 

Butch

   Hi Jeb:   I just saw an interesting article on channel 13 news.
   In Pennallis county during the F Cat tests the students will be aloud
to use calculators? Now how is a child learning by useing a machine as
they neglect to use the greatest computer ever designed," The Human
BRAIN!"
    Is this what you call fair? To test ESE students on the same level
where a student uses a calculator?
    Lets face it. Any monkee can be trained to push buttons but it takes 
 brain power to sit down and think out an answer!
  Back when I was in school we did not have calculators nor would we have
been permitted to use them.
 Really what kind of educational system are you running in this state?
   Like I said befor take away the computers until they learn how to use
thier brains! Thanks for your time.

Subject:	FCAT levels of comfort

Dear Mr. Edmonds,
 
It is with great concern that I read your quote,
 
"Our sense is that people are losing their apprehension for the FCAT," 
said Bill Edmonds, a spokesman for the Department of Education. "Most 
families are growing comfortable with it, and hopefully, learning to 
appreciate its value."
 
I am grateful for your remarks in that they encouraged me to craft the following rebuttal:
 
Your statement is uninformed and rather glib in the face of a test that has actually caused physical illness and more. Moreover, as the mother of seven children, I have had exposure to this test, and the stress is severe for each child approaching it anew. Furthermore, my twin children who are experiencing it for the first time this year have been tested for enrollment in the gifted program in our town because of academic achievement, and yet one of them is in danger of failing the FCAT because of his inability to concentrate well. My children are much too concerned about succeeding for their teacher and for their school than any child should be. The threat of failure hanging over their heads at this age is more stressful and damaging to the family unit than you can imagine, apparently. We are clearly not learning to appreciate it, as you suggest, because it is a poor tool to use in measurement of educational quality of schools. It comes with a price all too dear for most of us - the health, self-esteem and well being of our children... not to mention teachers, parents, and administrators.
 
A comment about one of the factual situations for those whose children have disabilities but for whom there are no accommodations, such as the young, intelligent man from Port Orange who has dyslexia - the failure of this test will define him - and therefore so will his disability define him - which is a poor measurement of this young man and his skill and talent. He has proven that he seeks success as his academic record shows. Should he be redefined as a failing, non-graduating senior by virtue of FCAT? Of course in this day and age we are all enlightened enough to realize that a disability is not a defining measurement of a person... Wouldn't you agree that failure of this test which could be directly attributed to the student's dyslexic condition and lack of accommodations for it would certainly effect his self-esteem and confidence? I imagine that his family would never "appreciate the value of FCAT".
 
Many successful people have achieved their personal success in spite of their disability, and yes there are those who have achieved great success without even being able to read using normal standards. I implore you to ask yourself why then it should be permissible for a state to set the stage for failure as they have done through FCAT testing. 
 
I would be remiss if I didn't mention that there are many other scenarios that I didn't address, where FCAT is of negative impact to the life - not just the grade level - of a child and their family -just look in the paper, on the internet, etc. Conversely, I have read and heard very little about those who feel that it has had a positive impact on the academic experience of their child. We await a better plan. We have paid, elected officials who should be burning the midnight oil creating a positive solution instead of harmless children laying awake in fear of failure. 
 
I welcome feedback from you as well as from others to which this email has been sent, and in the meantime, after having worked every evening with my kids on this frightening test, look forward to March 13th as the end of an exhausting, intimidating, and unnecessary two and one half months. ...And we hope that our kids are able to exemplify to the state what their teacher and I already know about them.
 
Sincerely,
 
Mary O'Meara

" No. but if you ask the lady at the desk, she'll tell you ...and where you

Subject:	manatee



Dear Jeb,

I was at a wedding a couple of weeks ago and found we had a mutual friend.
She  told me of your personal love of manatee. We seem to have similar likes
since one of our fondest memories is having a mother give birth to her calf
in our boat house. It was an educational, and heart worming, experience for
the whole family, neighbors, and friends. The Manatee family still after
several years return to our dock regularly during the summer for fresh water
and they love Saint Augustine Grass. Manatee jewelry and T-shirts are  a
"given" on all special occasions.

Although I support the Manatee protection program, it is my opinion ( as one
that lives on the water inhabited by Manatee ) that the current boating
restrictions, under the pretense of Manatee protection is very counter
productive and may have very negative impacts, especially on the younger
members of our community.

For the past several years during the summer the neighborhood kids would
gather in our "backyard" and plan their strategy for the days adventures on
the water. Weather it be fishing, wake boarding, or just plain exploring. It
did my heart good, as I left for work,  to see 8 or 10 boys in their jon
boats at sunrise ready to get out-on-the water. With the current boating
restrictions this has stopped and the video arcades are doing a booming
business.

Last year the boys would wave down the Marine Patrol and discuss where he
had seen Red Fish tailing, or where to avoid because of Manatee activity.
Today the Marine Patrol are avoided and the "bad guys". Not healthy!  I was
taught the policeman is your friend; not to these boys!

 I've heard a lot of rumors, and  know  there must be  some real political
or legal issues driving the boating restriction issue that I do not
understand. But as a resident that has spent 30 years on the affected
waters, I can tell you there are more Manatee today than there have ever
been. And recreational boating is NOT a threat to the species.

The point of this note is to ask haw we can go about amending the law to
allow local kids to run their 9HP or less boats in these areas when school
is out this summer.

Thanks, Brian Malin Sr.

Hi All,
 
Last night we had a great turnout at our ESE Family Night in Osceola County, organized by Joy Suldo. Didn't have time this week to pick up the display board, way to busy.
Again, I met parents from Osceola County who have children eligible for DD but or they were discouraged by Myrta Perez (former case worker for our County) or their file was lost.
Don't know if you reminder the statistics...There is ONLY 42 children in the Medwaiver for the ENTIRE County...there is 68 children (in between 3 and 18 years old) who are on the waiting list..So ONLY 110 children are registered with DD.
I think you know that in between TMH,EMH, PMH and Austistic classes we have in this County about 1,000 children.
We have 150 children in the PMH (profound mentally handicap) obviously who are eligible for DD.
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE???
You all know that I wrote to Carl Littlefiel about it, then to Susan Dickerson about it...Talked also to Cheryl Mundy who is basically tired to hear me...But WHAT do I suppose to do? Let these children down? 
I think that US as the FCC district seven, should address this HUGE problem to DD Administrators. This is really UNFAIR that an entire
County is penalized because of a bad worker... As right now we don't even have one full time worker for this County.
My request is that the FCC will support this County too.
Thank you ALL, I am waiting for your reply...Beatrice

Don't know if our Veterans Affairs is using this, but seems like a good
idea.  I don't feel our country does enough for retired military and people
who fought to keep this country safe and free.  Seems like we are always

> ATLANTIC BLUE CROSS CARE LOCATES TO THE ATLANTIC TECHNOLOGY CENTRE
>
> CHARLOTTETOWN, PEI -- The Honourable Wayne Easter, Solicitor General of
Canada; the Honourable Dr. Rey D. Pagtakhan, Minister of Veterans Affairs;
the Honourable Mike Currie, Minister of  Development and Technology; and Mr.
Paul Dowie, Chief Operating Officer, Government Programs for Atlantic Blue
Cross Care (ABCC), announced today that ABCC will soon be tenants in the
Atlantic Technology Centre (ATC).  The expansion of the Atlantic Blue Cross
Care office to Charlottetown is a direct result of the $100 M Federal Health
Claims Processing System contract with Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC) that
was awarded last spring.
> Solicitor General Easter stated, "This announcement demonstrates the
Government of Canada's commitment for employment opportunities and economic
growth for Prince Edward Island while enhancing the capabilities of Veterans
Affairs Canada to serve its clients."
> "Working with our partners, the Government of Canada is committed to
meeting the health care needs of the clients of the three federal
departments," said Minister Pagtakhan. "Veterans Affairs Canada has built a
solid reputation for providing quality benefit administration.  Through Blue
Cross, we are enhancing that reputation by delivering our health benefits in
a timely way to Veterans and our other clients, while at the same time
contributing to on-going economic development on Prince Edward Island with
an additional 30 jobs being created to process the health benefits for the
three federal departments."
> "This is an excellent example of how the investment we have made in the
infrastructure at the ATC pays off for Islanders," said Minister Currie. "By
providing the kind of information technology this company requires, we have
been able to support the creation of jobs in this key sector."
>   In March 2002,  Veterans Affairs Canada signed a $100 million contract
with ABCC  for the development and administration of the Federal Health
Claims Processing System.  The new system will allow for on-line claims
payment and enhance claims management services such as on-line prescription
drug claims processing in the delivery of health benefits for Veterans
Affairs Canada, the Canadian Forces and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
>   Eligible clients are able to present their health card to receive a
prescription drug, for example, and within minutes a pharmacist anywhere in
Canada will be able to electronically access Blue Cross' approval network
and fill the prescription with no out-of-pocket cost to the client or
additional paperwork.
> "Our increased presence in PEI reflects our commitment to VAC and to the
economic development for the people of PEI.  The Technology Centre provides
close proximity to VAC and easy access for our walk-in clients who use our
Quick Pay services," said Mr. Dowie. "There's no better place to showcase
our capabilities than in the Atlantic Technology Centre where we will be
able to take advantage of and provide new technology for training and
application building and support."
> ABCC has already begun the recruiting process and expects to have the
office fully staffed by mid-May. The 30 positions will be a mix of
technical, operational, information management, training and medical.

Subject:	Marketing the Suwannee River Wilderness Trail

I am a litle concerned about the marketing of the Suwannee River Wilderness Trail.  Every efffort should be made by State Parks to enlist people who are familar with the Suwannee Basin.  They should also not be connected with the old agendas sponsored by Visit Florida, who enlisted people and contnue to do so, who have no knowledge of the region.  Among other blunders, I refer you to the debacle of the first printing of about 100,000 copies of "Going with the Flow" brochures, which read canoe the rapids at White Springs, canoe the crystal-clear Itchetucknee, while to the west, drought interrupts the Withlacoochee, turning river beds into hiking trails.  When representatives of the Madison County Tourist Development Council asked Visit Florida to pull this inaccurrate publication from public distribution, Visit Florida refused.  It didn't matter that they circulated inaccurrate information.  They then reprinted another 80,000 which were better, but again more capital spending.  Irresponsible capital spending seems to be the order of the day in the North Central Regional Planning Council District (the Suwannee Basin). 
 
I have tried for years to get Visit Florida, State Parks, the North Regional Planning Council and other "cooperating agencies" to at least come and look at the area.  These marketing experts have no clue as to what they are marketing.  The other factor which lead to this debacle was that Visit Florida uses the same old cronies to write their stuff, whether they have knowledge of the area or not.   
 
There has been a lot of anamosity towards me, because I tried to work with them and get them to know the area.  They preferred to take money for rural areas and dump it into large capital projects in White Springs, Lake City, Gainesville and Steinhatchee, where their cronies are.  These areas needed the money the least.  
 
When I disagreed with the political back scratching by the "cooperating agencies" I was ignored at the Regional Tourism Task Force Meetings (North Central Regional Planning Council) and treated with open hostility by Visit Florida employees.  At the October 2002 meeting Visit Florida employee, Sherri Martin, was so hostile that she attempted to back hand me.  This was inappropriate behavior, but this is what happens when people are promoted to their level of incompetency and not held accountable..  Let's not make the same mistake with the Suwannee River Wilderness Trail.  Anyone marketer of the Wilderness Trail should not be connected with Visit Florida.  However, Visit Florida marketing should be used, but they should be monitored every step of the way.  I suspect that much of the hostility towards me was because of my open support for the Governor.  In short, Visit Florida does not hold their employees accountable for poor work or poor behavior.  
 
I encourage all "cooperating agencies" and the Governor's Office to broaden the representation on Visit Floirda's Nature/Heritage Advisory Committee to the Commission on Tourism.  These folks have been here since at least 1998.  They are also the biggest beneficiaries of the capital spending, which was legislated for rural areas, but ended up in with the same old businesses and government agencies.
 
Since none of the marketers understand the Suwannee Basin, I would like to make the following informative points:
 
1)The Upper Suwannee Basin runs east to west (not south to Lake City or Gainesville).
2)The upper Suwannee Basin includes the Little River, The Withlacoochee River, and the Okeefenokee.   These contribute 60% of the water to the lower Suwannee and 40% of all water which reaches the Gulf.
3) Florida springs run down the Withlacoochee and then down the Suwannee.  There are very few (and no significant springs on the upper Suwannee). 
4) I recommend that anyone marketing the Suwanne Basin contact Harley Means at the Geological Survey in Tallahassee for information about the area.  At present, there are no marketers who are informed or familar with the Upper Suwannee.

Thanks for your email, Catherine.  I really appreciate your thoughtful comments.
 
I would agree with you that the majority of Just Read, Florida! activities in the past year have focused mainly on the early grades.  That is partly because of the abundance of clear research that tells us what needs to happen in K-3, as well as the support from the feds through the Reading First grant to implement that research.  The focus is there also because of the 3rd grade retention law -- so that we stop sending children to 4th grade when they cannot read independently.
 
I would also agree with you that we need to bring research-based efforts to middle and high school struggling readers and teachers as well.  In my proposed budget, I recommend 30 million dollars for Just Read, Florida! and plan on directing a large portion of that to the training of middle and high school teachers, as well as to helping districts put the best proven reading programs in place that can help middle and high school students catch up.  I'll also point out that we have recommended earmarking 3 million of the Critical Teacher Shortage Funds specifically for reading, so that middle and high school teachers can go after our new reading endorsement.
 
As you’ve said in your email, it is true that "with sustained effort, every child can learn to read at the 3rd or 4th grade level." But it is important to recognize that there are many children that will need explicit and systematic instruction throughout their academic careers in order to prevent some from becoming part of that 70% prison population with low-literacy skills.  And, as you have said, it is also true that "substantive change in current teaching and assessment practices and policies" is needed to develop proficient readers. Our reading endorsement is poised to address that very issue.
 
We cannot assume that just because a middle or high school student can pronounce a word on a page means that student is a fluent reader.  The only way we can ensure that a student is fluent, with a good vocabulary and strong comprehension skills is to track that student's progress throughout the year.  Our assessment model of screening, diagnosis and progress monitoring will assure that students are progressing as they need to.  And we must ensure that teachers have the skills to do this.
 
For too long we have confused literacy instruction with literature instruction. Middle and high school students that are not fluent readers will not be able to comprehend well. And, finally, as you had done so well at Savannah State University, we can and must explicitly model higher-level thinking skills in order for students to comprehend challenging text.  But in for order for students to handle the amount of ideas and the volume of work demanded at the college level, we have to ensure that students are independent readers.

Thanks again for your email, and I look forward to continuing this discussion with you.df

Subject: Literacy issues
Importance: High



Dear Governor Bush,

 

I recently read an article about you in the Washington Post when I was in Washington a few days ago, and mention was made of your preference for email. I thought I would introduce myself to you this way, since we are not likely to meet in person. I did attend the meeting you held with the state university presidents and the education deans, but there was little opportunity for any extended dialogue. I would like to share with you my perspectives on reading based not only on my experience as the dean of education at your flagship university, but also as one who has done research on language and culture issues (I have dual training as both an anthropologist and psychologist), and finally, as a former English teacher. 

 

First, I would like to commend you on the intense focus you have placed on helping children become more proficient readers, especially your emphasis on the early grades. You are absolutely right in your insistence that if children do not learn to read, they will be a serious disadvantage later in life. No doubt you are familiar with the statistics that indicate that 70% of people in prison have a third grade literacy level or less, and that many occupations will remain inaccessible to those who cannot read well. I also believe your Just Read Florida initiative will be successful because it incorporates parents and community members into the reading process more extensively. These are laudable goals, and you certainly have the support of many of my college faculty behind you in this campaign. 

 

However, I am deeply concerned that the current campaign appears to be focused too narrowly on the early grades, and does not emphasize strategies and practices that are necessary to help children achieve higher levels of literacy. After about fourth grade, reading ability takes a qualitative jump from simple decoding skills to higher order abilities such as analyzing and synthesizing information, interpreting multiple kinds of text, and critical reasoning skills. In short, children have to acquire and use multiple literacies from a number of domains in order to be successful. The fact is that with sustained effort, every child can learn to read at about the 3rd to 4th grade level.  Getting every child to read at grade level (e.g., 12th grade by the time they leave high school) is a Herculean task, and one that I do not believe will be accomplished without substantive changes in current teaching and assessment practices and policies.

 

Let me list some of the problems, and then relate an anecdote from a workshop I recently conducted at Savannah State University in South Carolina, a historically black college. The first problem is that most reading materials in our culture basically are written at about the 6th to 7th grade level. The most popular newspaper, USA Today, is written at this level, as are many well known magazines. The average high school textbook has been dumbed down with extensive pictures to be at about the 8th grade level. It’s no wonder that students who then go to attend a first rate university are in shock when they encounter college texts, since they really are written at that level. Furthermore, this culture does not reward people who read extensively and well; in fact, such people (outside the academy) are considered “nerds.” The only way to get more proficient at reading is to do quite a lot of it, but students’ attention today is captured by a variety of media where concentrated, sustained engagement with the object of study is not necessary. Unless students have extensive experience with a high quality curriculum taught by an expert teacher who can engage them with a text, and sharpen their thinking skills in the process, they are not likely to achieve these higher literacy levels. 

 

My points above were vividly brought to life in the workshop I taught at Savannah State. I had been called in to give them some technical advice on the Georgia Regents Reading Test, which all college students in the state must pass in order to graduate. The test consists of 10 passages, with about 6 questions each, for a total of 60 questions. The test is one hour in length. The questions assess students’ competency in four domains: literal (ability to understand factual information); vocabulary, inferential (ability to draw conclusions), and analysis (ability to recognize tone, genres, and figurative language like metaphors). Savannah State has the lowest student passing rate in the state, and I was asked to provide strategies for helping students perform better. 

 

In working with the students, you may be interested to learn what I discovered. One, all of the students could read the passages in the sense that no one had a decoding problem or couldn’t recognize letters, sounds, etc. Two, they generally did well on the literal questions, and had problems with only a few vocabulary words. The main problems were with the inferential and analysis questions, and these problems can be traced back to students’ lack of familiarity with these kinds of materials and teaching techniques for helping them understand what they were reading. In other words, it was their lack of knowledge that held them back, not their lack of ability. Once I showed them how the text was constructed, and probed their thinking about it, they were able to respond. One of the English professors at the university was in the room with me, and she noted that when she taught a similar workshop, all the students who worked with her passed the test. A common reaction expressed by many of the students was regret that they had never been exposed to this form of teaching (what I call teaching for conceptual understanding) and more sophisticated reading materials. Given that most of them came from poor rural schools with few resources, I was not surprised at these comments. 

 

What I hope you will thoughtfully consider is that the mode of instruction, and the corresponding assessment, used in the early grades to build basis literacy skills are not the ones that should be used in later grades. Unfortunately, what I see in Florida is a one size fits all approach to instruction and assessment, and that approach is unlikely to produce the results you want. Even worse, the poorest children are the least likely to get the most skilled teachers who really know how to build a conceptual understanding of literacy that is grounded in rich contextual experiences with multiple texts. While you have funded initiatives to support the development of early reading skills, a direction I certainly agree is important, I hope you will also support initiatives that promote conceptual understanding of literacy across different domains. I believe there are faculty available at UF and around the state who can assist in this effort, and I would be happy to answer any questions you might have as to how this might be done. 

 

By the way, have you ever thought about what would happen if we actually did succeed in enabling every student to leave high school reading at grade level?
